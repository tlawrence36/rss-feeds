      "The Vietnam War cast a long shadow across one of the most fertile periods of American filmmaking, and has led filmmakers for the half-century since to reckon with its complicated legacy.",
      "These 10 films, assembled to mark the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, range from indelible anti-war classics to Vietnamese portraits of resistance, capturing the vastness of the war\u2019s still-reverberating traumas.",
      "The war was more than a decade in and some eight years from its conclusion when a 25-year-old Martin Scorsese made this six-minute short. In it, a man simply shaves himself before a sink and a mirror. After a few knicks and cuts, he doesn\u2019t stop, continuing until his face is a bloody mess \u2014 a neat but gruesome metaphor to Vietnam.",
      "A young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searches for her family in the bombed-out ruins of Hanoi in H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark of Vietnamese cinema. It\u2019s a work of wartime propaganda (it begins with the intro: \u201chonoring the heroes of Hanoi who defeated the American imperialist B-52 bombing raid\u201d) but also of aching humanity. Set against the December 1972 bombing raids on Hanoi, \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d is cinema made in the very midst of war.",
      "Controversy greeted Peter Davis\u2019 landmark documentary around its release, but time has only proved how soberly clear-eyed it was. Newsreel clips and homefront interviews are contrasted with the horrors on the ground in Vietnam in this penetrating examination of the gulf between American policy and Vietnamese reality. Its title comes from President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s line, said when escalating the war, that \u201cthe ultimate victory will depend on the hearts and minds of the people who actually live out there.\u201d",
      "It's arguably the preeminent American film about the Vietnam War. No other movie more grandly or tragically charts the American evolution from innocence to disillusionment than Michael Cimino\u2019s devastating epic about working-class friends (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage) from a Pennsylvania steel town drafted into war. The final sing-along scene to \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d after their lives have irrevocably changed, remains a powerfully poignant gut punch.",
      "Francis Ford Coppola wagered everything he had on his masterpiece \u2014 and nearly lost it. \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d which transposes Joseph Conrad\u2019s \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d to the Vietnam War, is an epic of madness that teeters on the brink of hallucination. Shot in the Philippines and more faithful to Conrad than to Vietnam, \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d doesn\u2019t so much illuminate the chaos and moral confusion of the war as elevate it to grandiose nightmare.",
      "The 1980s saw a wave of Hollywood films about Vietnam, including \u201cFirst Blood,\u201d \u201cHamburger Hill,\u201d \u201cGood Morning Vietnam,\u201d \u201cCasualties of War\u201d and \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July.\u201d Foremost among them is the Oscar best picture-winning \u201cPlatoon,\u201d which Oliver Stone wrote based on his own experiences as an infantryman in Vietnam. Widely acclaimed for its realism, Stone\u2019s film remains among the most intensely vivid and visceral dramatizations of the war.",
      "Stanley Kubrick should be more often thought of as the supreme anti-war moviemaker. His devastating World War I film \u201cPaths of Glory\u201d and the subversive satire \u201cDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\u201d are classics in their own right. \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d carries those films\u2019 themes of dehumanization into an even more brutal place. Split between the harrowing boot-camp tyranny of R. Lee Ermey\u2019s drill instructor and the urban violence of the 1968 Tet Offensive, \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d fuses both ends of the war machine.",
      "How former soldiers lived with their experience in Vietnam has been a subject of many fine films, from Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d (1978) to Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cDa 5 Bloods\u201d (2020). In Werner Herzog\u2019s nonfiction gem, he profiles the astonishing story of German-American pilot Dieter Dengler. In the film, which Herzog later remade as 2007\u2019s \u201cRescue Dawn\u201d with Christian Bale, Dengler recounts \u2014 and sometimes reenacts \u2014 his experience being shot down over Laos, being captured and tortured and then escaping into the jungle.",
      "Not long after the turn of the century, former U.S. defense secretary and Vietnam War architect Robert S. McNamara sat for interviews with documentarian Errol Morris. The result is a chilling reflection on the thinking that led to one of American\u2019s greatest follies. It\u2019s not a mea culpa but a thornier and more disquieting rumination on how rationalized ideology can lead to the deaths of millions \u2014 and still not yield an apology. Of McNamara\u2019s lessons, No. 1 is \u201cempathize with the enemy.\u201d",
      "Steven Spielberg\u2019s stirring film dramatizes the Washington Post\u2019s 1971 publishing of the Pentagon Papers, a collection of classified documents that chronicled America\u2019s 20-year involvement in Southeast Asia. While government analyst Daniel Ellsberg (a moving participant in \u201cHearts and Minds\u201d) could be considered the hero of this story, \u201cThe Post\u201d turns its focus to Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep) and the wartime role of the Fourth Estate.",

      "A former roommate of one of Harvey Weinstein's accusers has testified the woman told her in July 2006 that the then-movie mogul had forcibly performed oral sex on her",
      "NEW YORK -- Hovering in the doorway of her roommate's bedroom one evening in July 2006, TV production assistant Miriam Haley said Harvey Weinstein \u2014 her boss \u2014 had forcibly performed oral sex on her, her then-roommate testified Thursday at the ex-movie mogul's retrial.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Miriam, that sounds like rape. I think you should call a lawyer,\u2019\u201d but a shaken Haley seemed disinclined to do so, recalled the ex-roommate, Elizabeth Entin.",
      "If secondhand, it was the first testimony jurors have gotten so far about any of the alleged sexual assaults at the heart of the retrial, which opened Wednesday. Haley and two other accusers are expected to testify later in the weekslong proceeding.",
      "Weinstein, 73, maintains that he has never sexually assaulted or raped anyone. His lawyers argue that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer in hopes of getting ahead in the entertainment business.",
      "Weinstein was transformed in 2017 from a Hollywood tycoon into the #MeToo movement's archvillain, after a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public.",
      "He was convicted in 2020 of raping Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor, and sexually assaulting Haley, who worked on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway.\u201d But New York's highest court overturned his conviction last year, finding that the trial judge had allowed prejudicial testimony.",
      "The reversal led to the retrial, which includes an additional allegation of forcible oral sex on a different woman, former model Kaja Sokola. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "Entin was among the witnesses who are returning to the stand five years after testifying in the landmark #MeToo case. But prosecutors, some defense lawyers and the judge are different \u2014 and so are the contours of the testimony and evidence being elicited.",
      "For instance, this time Entin didn't give any details of what she said Haley told her about the alleged sexual assault.",
      "And Entin wasn't asked about a recollection that made for a memorable and rare light moment at the first trial \u2014 a time when she said Weinstein showed up uninvited and was chased around the women's apartment by Entin's pet Chihuahua.",
      "Farber had indicated he didn't think that having Entin describe the purported episode was fair game for the trial.",
      "In another measure of the looping trajectory of the case, Entin found herself testifying about what she has said and written about the first trial itself. The fashion startup founder and consultant has reflected on the case in a book, on podcasts and some interviews.",
      "Weinstein attorney Jennifer Bonjean confronted her with instances in which Entin referred to her participation in the first trial as her \u201c15 minutes of fame\u201d and compared gearing up for testifying to preparing for battle.",
      "Entin responded tensely that being cross-examined was a form of \u201cvery civilized battle.\u201d",
      "The voluble Entin said that her writing style was sometimes \u201cmildly hyperbolic,\u201d but that she'd been describing how she girded herself for a daunting experience.",
      "The Associated Press does not identify people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they agree to be named. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "If you wanted to find the Vietnam War in American television shows, you mostly had to wait until it was long over",
      "The evening news brought the Vietnam War into American living rooms, but once the news was over, so was the war. Prime-time shows brought nary a mention of it as networks looked to bring uncontroversial content to the broadest possible audience. But the war simmered below the surface as subtext, and when enough years passed, television would finally take it on as a subject.",
      "\u201cGomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\u201d premiered on CBS six weeks after the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorized U.S. combat troops in Vietnam, and the daft comedy was among the chief images of the military in American homes through the peak of U.S. involvement in 1969. Naturally, the show about a country rube in the Marine Corps never directly mentioned the war. But most of the real-life Marines who marched in its introduction would soon be fighting in Vietnam. Star Jim Nabors later said watching that intro was difficult, knowing some of those men had died.",
      "It would take \u201cAll in the Family\u201d to bring the war into prime-time discourse. The Norman Lear-created CBS comedy owed its popularity to timely political bickering between cantankerous patriarch Archie Bunker (Carroll O\u2019Connor) and his liberal-minded son-in-law Michael \u201cMeathead\u201d Stivic (Rob Reiner). Vietnam was the sole subject of a landmark 1976 episode where a draft-dodging fugitive friend of Michael\u2019s comes to Christmas dinner, and an explosive argument ensues. \u201cWhen the hell are you going to admit that the war was wrong?!\u201d Michael shouts. A friend of Archie\u2019s whose son died in the war shocks him by taking his son-in-law\u2019s side.",
      "Set in the Korean War of the early 1950s, \u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d the CBS dramedy about wisecracking U.S. Army doctors, was among the most popular shows in the country during the Vietnam War\u2019s final years. It was heavy with anti-military, anti-war sentiment, evoking the zeitgeist of a Vietnam-exhausted populace. \u201cWar isn\u2019t Hell,\u201d Hawkeye Pierce, played by Alan Alda, says in a typical line. \u201cThere are no innocent bystanders in Hell, but war is chock full of them.\u201d (The Robert Altman film the show stemmed from deliberately minimized references to Korea to maximize its unspoken commentary on Vietnam.)",
      "Television's first regular portrayal of Vietnam veterans came in the form of a cartoonish crew of daring mercenaries that reflected the era of Reagan and Rambo. NBC\u2019s \u201cThe A-Team,\u201d whose members included a mohawked-and-gold-chained Mr. T and a cigar-chomping George Peppard, were a \u201ccrack commando unit\u201d who were innocent fugitives from military justice and worked as mercenaries pulling off weekly capers. Explosions and jumping cars abounded. In a fourth-season episode, the team returns to Vietnam for a job. Peppard\u2019s Hannibal momentarily struggles with dark war memories before getting back to the lighthearted action.",
      "HBO aired and helped organize a 1987 charity concert dubbed \u201cWelcome Home\u201d that billed itself as the warm celebration Vietnam War veterans never got upon their return. Performers included James Brown, Linda Ronstadt and Stevie Wonder. The July Fourth concert was not a militaristic affair, and had a hate-the-war, love-the-troops vibe. Some of the most anti-war songs of the \u201960s were performed by artists like John Fogerty and Crosby, Stills & Nash. The event would be a harbinger of a wave of cultural nostalgia and reckoning as baby boomers began turning 40 and were in the mood to reflect.",
      "With \u201cTour of Duty,\u201d the Vietnam War finally came to prime time. The CBS series that premiered in 1987 showed actual combat and the young men who fought and died in it. It might have been called \u201cPlatoon: The Series,\u201d after the Vietnam film that had just won best picture at the Oscars. Surprisingly gory and gritty for a network show, it had all the hallmarks of the era\u2019s many Vietnam movies. But executives seeking lower costs and higher ratings \u2014 which never came \u2014 eventually moved production from Hawaii to California and introduced romances and soapy plotlines typical of TV dramas.",
      "And suddenly, there were two Vietnam series on TV. ABC\u2019s \u201cChina Beach\u201d was part-\u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d part-\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d part-\u201cMad Men.\u201d Set in a wartime evacuation hospital \u2014 the title was the Americans\u2019 nickname for My Khe Beach in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng \u2014 it focused on Army medics and civilians. It was festooned with \u201960s songs whose copyrights have kept the series off streaming services. Beloved by critics, \u201cChina Beach\u201d made a star and a best-actress Emmy winner of Dana Delany, but never found a mass audience. With its cancellation, network TV depictions of the war would disappear for years.",
      "\u201cThe Wonder Years\u201d was baby boomer nostalgia in its purest form. The ABC series, narrated by an adult Kevin Arnold (voiced by Daniel Stern, played as a child by Fred Savage), depicts his boyhood feelings and experiences with the backing of sentimental \u201960s songs. The specter of Vietnam dominates its first season, which sees Kevin\u2019s hero \u2014 the big brother of his neighbor and crush Winnie Cooper \u2014 die in the war. In a 2021 reboot, the story shifts to a Black family in Alabama, with narrator Dean Williams\u2019 brother a returning Vietnam vet who faces racism at home.",
      "The NBC miniseries \u201cThe \u201960s\u201d was a roundup of the decade\u2019s cliches that by then had been well-established in movies and TV. The 1999 two-night event was billed as \u201cthe movie event of a generation.\u201d Its subjects were three Chicago siblings who each go on very 1960s journeys. For Jerry O\u2019Connell\u2019s high-school quarterback character, that meant serving in Vietnam. He enlists in a gung-ho moment, but by the show\u2019s second night, he\u2019s back home with an Army jacket and long hair, drinking to bury his trauma. The show drew a big audience at a time when NBC was ratings king.",
      "The time-hopping, tear-jerking NBC family drama \u201cThis Is Us\u201d used the Vietnam War to delve into the psyche of Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia), who refused to talk about his experience as a soldier with his wife and kids before his premature death. In dual plotlines that run through its third season, with the emotional themes and folk-acoustic soundtrack that are hallmarks of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d Jack is shown enlisting to try to protect his drafted younger brother. Decades later, his son Kevin (Justin Hartley) travels to Vietnam to find out what happened to his father and uncle.",
      "In a docuseries that ran over 10 nights on PBS, the Vietnam War got the same hallowed treatment Ken Burns brought nearly 30 years earlier to the Civil War. Burns and Lynn Novick's \u201cThe Vietnam War\" was not as soft or sentimental as his reputation might have suggested. It was a rare PBS show with a TV-MA rating, and its tone, with a modern soundtrack from composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, matched the messiness of the conflict. The show went to lengths to include a North Vietnamese perspective along with American and South Vietnamese vets and historians.",
      "It took until 2024 before a fictional television show would attempt a Vietnamese perspective of the war\u2019s end and its aftermath, though it brought mixed reactions from Vietnamese American viewers. HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Sympathizer\u201d was based on Viet Thanh Nguyen\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The first two episodes of the black-comic limited series depict a harrowing flight during the fall of Saigon. Actors of Vietnamese descent played most of its main roles, including lead Hoa Xuande. But much of the attention given to it \u2014 and its only Emmy nomination \u2014 went to Robert Downey Jr. for his portrayal of four different white American men.",

      "NEW YORK -- Opening statements began Wednesday in Harvey Weinstein \u2019s rape retrial, five years after his original #MeToo trial delivered a searing reckoning for one of Hollywood\u2019s most powerful figures.",
      "Emphasizing the former studio boss's onetime influence in the movie industry, prosecutor Shannon Lucey said Weinstein used \u201cdream opportunities as weapons\u201d to prey on the three accusers in the case. He is charged with raping one and forcing oral sex on the other two.",
      "\u201cThe defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,\u201d Lucey said.",
      "The case is being retried because an appeals court threw out the landmark 2020 conviction.",
      "The retrial is happening at the same Manhattan courthouse as the first trial, and two accusers who testified then are expected to return.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s retrial is playing out at a different cultural moment than the first, which happened during the height of the #MeToo movement. Along with the charges being retried, he faces an additional allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t involved in the first case.",
      "The jury counts seven women and five men \u2014 unlike the seven-man, five-woman panel that convicted him in 2020 \u2014 and there's a different judge.",
      "The #MeToo movement, which exploded in 2017 with allegations against Weinstein, has also evolved and ebbed.",
      "At the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, chants of \u201crapist\u201d could be heard from protesters outside.",
      "TV trucks lined the street, and reporters queued for hours to get a seat in the packed courtroom. His lawyers decried the \u201ccarnival-like atmosphere\u201d and fought unsuccessfully to get the trial moved from Manhattan.",
      "This time, over five days of jury selection, there was none of that.",
      "Those realities, coupled with the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling last year vacating his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence \u2014 because the judge allowed testimony about allegations Weinstein was not charged with \u2014 are shaping everything from retrial legal strategy to the atmosphere in court.",
      "Weinstein, 73, is being retried on a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant, Miriam Haley, in 2006 and a third-degree rape charge for allegedly assaulting an aspiring actor, Jessica Mann, in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Weinstein also faces a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006. Prosecutors said that the woman, who hasn\u2019t been named publicly, came forward days before his first trial but wasn\u2019t part of that case. They said they revisited her allegations when his conviction was thrown out.",
      "The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have done.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone. His acquittals on the two most serious charges at his 2020 trial \u2014 predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Lindsay Goldbrum, a lawyer for the unnamed accuser, said Weinstein\u2019s retrial marks a \u201cpivotal moment in the fight for accountability in sex abuse cases\u201d and a \u201csignal to other survivors that the system is catching up \u2014 and that it\u2019s worth speaking out even when the odds seem insurmountable.\u201d",
      "This time around, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is prosecuting Weinstein through its Special Victims Division, which specializes in such cases, after homicide veterans helmed the 2020 version. At the same time, Weinstein has added several lawyers to his defense team \u2014 including Jennifer Bonjean, who is involved in appealing his 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles. She helped Bill Cosby get his conviction overturned and defended R. Kelly in his sex crimes case.",
      "\u201cThis trial is not going to be all about #MeToo. It\u2019s going to be about the facts of what took place,\u201d Weinstein\u2019s lead attorney, Arthur Aidala, said recently. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a big deal. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d",
      "But there has already been some talk of #MeToo. A prosecutor asked prospective jurors whether they'd heard of the movement. Most said they had, but that it wouldn't affect them either way.",
      "Others went further.",

      "The main jury is more female than the five women and seven men who convicted Weinstein at his first trial five years ago. The verdict marked a signature moment for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct, which had been fueled in 2017 by a slew of allegations against Weinstein, then a high-flying movie producer of a string of Oscar winners including \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Board of Parole on Tuesday recommended a pardon for country music star Jelly Roll, a Nashville native who has spoken openly about his criminal record and what it has taken to overcome it. The board's action leaves the final decision on a pardon up to Gov. Bill Lee.",
      "The rapper-turned-country singer wants to be able to travel internationally to perform and share his message of redemption, after spending time behind bars as a young person.",
      "The board issued its nonbinding recommendation unanimously after a hearing that lasted about an hour and 45 minutes with several witnesses, including Nashville Sheriff Daron Hall, advocating for the 40-year-old musician named Jason DeFord. One board member recused themselves from voting.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \u201cWhitsitt Chapel\u201d and crossover songs like \u201cNeed a Favor.\u201d He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and earned four Grammy nominations, including for new artist of the year.",
      "\u201cThis was incredible,\u201d he said of the board's decision. \u201cI pray this goes through. But today was special for me, regardless.\u201d",
      "His most serious convictions include a robbery at age 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two other young men enter a house in 2002. Both of the others were carrying guns, although Jelly Roll was unarmed. They demanded money, and received $350 and a wallet with no money in it. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were arrested right away. He was sentenced to serve a year in prison and additional time on probation.",
      "Later, in 2008, police on patrol found both marijuana and crack cocaine in his car. He was sentenced to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "He also has two misdemeanor offenses for driving without a license and possession of drug paraphernalia.",
      "Lee, a Republican, said every case seeking clemency, such as pardons, is equally important and goes through a thorough process.",
      "\u201cThe reporting on Jelly Roll, that\u2019s encouraging for his situation, but there are steps yet to happen in that case,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Jelly Roll told the board that while in a detention center, he fell in love with songwriting. \u201cIt started as a passion project that felt therapeutic and would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable and opened doors that I\u2019ve never thought possible.\u201d",
      "These days, he often visits jails and rehabilitation centers before performing concerts. He has bought restaurants out for the day to feed people who are homeless and played basketball with kids at a youth center the same day that he performed in Winnipeg. He said he generally doesn't seek out news coverage when he makes these visits.",
      "As a part of the pardon application, friends and civic leaders wrote to the board about Jelly Roll\u2019s transformation and generosity. Hall, who runs Nashville\u2019s jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino also wrote in his favor, pointing out all the money he's given from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "One of the reasons Jelly Roll gave for needing a pardon is to be able to travel to Canada to perform, which his criminal record makes difficult. Currently, he would need to apply for a special permit that can include long wait times for a decision, according to a letter from an immigration attorney submitted with his clemency packet.",
      "\u201cI want to be an inspiration for people who are now where I used to be \u2014 to let them know that change is truly possible,\" Jelly Roll told the board. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m asking for your recommendation for this pardon is because I\u2019m looking to take my message of redemption through the power of music and faith through the rest of the world.\u201d",
      "He said he would use the pardon for much more than going on tour, though.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll still be using this same pardon, God willing, to go do missionary work in my 50s and 60s,\u201d he said.",
      "Due to his criminal record, he told the board that every time he travels it \u201ctakes a team of lawyers and a mountain of paperwork to secure my entry into those countries.\u201d He said he recently was able to make his first tour in Canada and took his first trip to the United Kingdom, where he spoke about a rehabilitation program.",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks at least five years since his sentence expired.",
      "Lee has issued more than 90 pardons since taking office in 2019, all of them since 2021.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Oscar voters will no longer be able to skip watching some of the nominated films.",
      "The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences on Monday announced that members will from now on be required to watch all nominated films in each category to be eligible to vote in the final round of Oscar voting. Up until now, Oscar voters had only been encouraged to watch the nominees, and vote in categories they felt qualified in.",
      "But in recent years, what films get watched by academy members has been increasingly seen as a significant factor in what wins. At the same time, the publication of anonymous Oscar ballots has often featured members confessing that they didn't get around to watching some notable films or not finishing lengthier nominees.",
      "On Monday, the academy also put forth a handful of new regulations on issues including AI, refugee filmmakers and the newly launched casting category.",
      "In the best international film category, the academy will now allow filmmakers with refugee or asylum status to be represented by a country not their own. The rule change keeps in place the broad apparatus of how international nominees are submitted through countries, but it tweaks eligibility.",
      "The regulation now reads: \u201cThe submitting country must confirm that creative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.\u201d",
      "Critics have long called on changes to the nominating process for best international film because it leaves the submission process in the hands of governments, not the academy. That's left dissident filmmakers working under authoritarian or undemocratic regimes with limited pathways to reaching the Oscars.",
      "Last year, for instance, the Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran before he was to be flogged and imprisoned for eight years in order to release his film \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig.\u201d Germany, where Rasoulof settled, submitted it for the Oscars and it was nominated. But other filmmakers, including Rasoulof's friend and countryman Jafar Panahi, have released films without a mechanism for submission.",
      "The rule change notably won't alter the Oscar prospects for filmmakers who haven't fled their home countries or change anything for films passed over by their nation's selection committees.",
      "The academy also ruled that the use of generative artificial intelligence tools \u201cneither help nor harm the chances of a nomination.\u201d How significantly AI is used in filmmaking has, as in other industries, been a much-debated topic in Hollywood. In this year's Oscar race, Brady Corbet's \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d was a subject of some controversy after its editor said that AI had been used to enhance the Hungarian dialogue of stars Adrien Brody (who ultimately won best actor ) and Felicity Jones (who was nominated for best supporting actress).",
      "\u201cThe academy and each branch will judge the achievement, taking into account the degree to which a human was at the heart of the creative authorship when choosing which movie to award,\u201d the academy said Monday.",
      "The film academy also set down some rules for its new achievement in casting Oscar. After a preliminary round of voting to determine a shortlist of 10 films, members of the casting branch will be invited to a \u201cbake-off\u201d presentation from the shortlisted films, including a Q&A with nominees.",
      "Earlier in April, the academy announced a new category for stunt design, but that award won't begin until the 2028 Oscars.",
      "Next year's Academy Awards will be held March 15, 2026, with Conan O'Brien returning to host the ABC telecast.",

He told The Associated Press that \u201cI\u2019ve never had this much freedom before, even in final-cut films that I worked on. The latitude was astonishing.\u201d",

      "Cast members say it can feel revolutionary working for Gilroy, who passes on the same freedom to them that Disney gives to him. They're never kept in the dark with the sort of script-rationing and secret-keeping that are the norm in major franchises.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in withholding information as power,\u201d said Adria Arjona, who plays Andor's partner Bix Caleen. \u201cBefore I read episode one, I knew the end. It\u2019s just unheard-of.\u201d",
      "Her character's arc in particular brings real-world elements including addiction and even darker forms of trauma unlike anything \u201cStar Wars\u201d has shown before.",
      "Gilroy said he didn't have to fight over the galaxy's canon at all. He had to get used to certain elements when he first worked within the franchise \u2014 no paper, no hinged doors, no knives, for example. But it's not necessarily held as sacred.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen canon stretch so much,\" he said. \"It was really tight on \u2018Rogue.\u2019 But a lot of things have changed since then.\u201d",

      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d the year\u2019s biggest Hollywood hit, followed close behind in second, collecting $41.3 million in its third week of release. That gave Warner Bros., after a handful of disappointments, an enviable one-two punch at the box office with one original, director-driven movie and one IP-based property.",
      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d which Warner Bros. co-produced with Legendary Pictures, has amassed $720.8 million worldwide in three weeks of release.",
      "Pam Abdy and Mike De Luca, co-chairs of Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, celebrated the two films\u2019 resonance with moviegoers. The studio accounted for a remarkable 64% of the domestic box office for the Easter weekend.",
      "\u201cMovies have the power to transport us to worlds only seen on the big screen, and Warner Bros. Pictures remains committed to bringing singular in-theater experiences to audiences looking for bold movies, both original and those based on beloved existing properties,\u201d Abdy and De Luca said in a statement Sunday.",
      "But all eyes were on the performance on \u201cSinners,\u201d which Warner Bros. went to extreme lengths to secure. Abdy and De Luca agreed to give Coogler not just a cut of gross ticket sales but ownership of the film after 25 years \u2014 a virtually unheard of concession.",
      "But Coogler and Jordan, whose collaborations stretch back to \u201cFruitvale Station,\u201d make up one of the industry\u2019s most potent director-actor duos. Reviews (98% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were stellar for \u201cSinners\u201d and audiences, too, were enthralled by its supernatural twists. The film earned an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore from moviegoers.",
      "Overseas, \u201cSinners\u201d faced a more uphill battle. It collected $15.4 million in 71 international markets. Domestically, \u201cSinners\u201d attracted a diverse audience: 38% Black, 35% white, 18% Hispanic and 5% Asian.",
      "Before \u201cSinners,\u201d dual roles had been rough business for Warner Bros. The studio saw flops in both \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d (a period gangster film featuring a doubled Robert De Niro) and \u201cMickey 17\u201d (a sci-fi movie with two Robert Pattinsons).",
      "But the strong opening for \u201cSinners,\u201d which should be sustained in the coming weeks given the strong word of mouth, cements Coogler\u2019s place as one of a handful of filmmakers whose name draws big audiences.

      "San Francisco has moved closer to adopting a \u201crecovery first\u201d drug policy that sets abstinence from illicit drugs as its primary goal",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Reeling from drug overdose deaths and scenes of people smoking fentanyl on sidewalks, San Francisco moved closer Thursday to adopting a \u201crecovery first\u201d drug policy that sets abstinence from illicit drugs as its primary goal, a proposal that has prompted heated debate in the city that pioneered harm reduction.",
      "Opponents of Supervisor Matt Dorsey's proposal say its emphasis on stopping drug use alienates those who are not ready to quit, while proponents say the city has been far too permissive and making drug use safer does not help break the cycle of addiction.",
      "Dorsey, himself recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, amended the proposal in his public safety committee to clarify that distributing safer-use paraphernalia and linking people to social services regardless of whether they are using remain critical to the city's response.",
      "But more than an hour of public comment with cheers and boos from both sides underscored just how touchy the issue remains.",
      "\u201cNo one dies from harm reduction,\u201d Patt Denning said. \u201cPeople die from conventional abstinence-based treatments because they\u2019re either left out or kicked out if they don\u2019t comply with abstinence.\u201d",
      "Brendan Harris, who said he has been clean for six years, countered that harm reduction tactics cannot go on forever and people need a firm if compassionate push into treatment.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just keep enabling drugs over and over again,\u201d he said.",
      "In recent years San Francisco's public health department advised people who use drugs to do so with friends to try to prevent overdose deaths. Critics said that sent the wrong message.",
      "Mayor Daniel Lurie, who took office in January, has vowed to solve the city's fentanyl crisis. Last year more than 600 people died from accidental overdoses.",
      "He ordered city-funded nonprofits to offer treatment or counseling options before giving out certain paraphernalia such as foil and pipes, and they will no longer be allowed to distribute those items in parks and on sidewalks.",
      "As amended, Dorsey's proposal states that the \u201clong-term remission of substance use disorders for individuals, with the help of fully supported and staffed evidence-based recovery and behavioral health services, shall be the primary goal.\u201d",
      "It also defines recovery as \u201cthe process by which an individual suffering from substance use disorder strives to make positive changes that become part of a voluntarily adopted healthy lifestyle.\u201d",
      "Dorsey said aspiring to live a healthy life free from illicit drug use should not be a controversial goal, and abstention can mean receiving methadone as part of a medication assisted treatment program. San Francisco offers an array of services to help people addicted to drugs, but many residents only see the free foil and pipes, he said.",
      "\u201cWe're losing the battle on harm reduction when people think that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said after the hearing.",
      "The San Francisco Marin Medical Society, which represents more than 3,500 physicians, proposed the amendments.",
      "The full Board of Supervisors votes on the proposal next month. It is expected to pass, with seven of the 11 members sponsoring or cosponsoring.",

    "story": [
      "The Agriculture Department says it is withdrawing a plan to limit salmonella bacteria in poultry products",
      "The Agriculture Department will not require poultry companies to limit salmonella bacteria in their products, halting a Biden Administration effort to prevent food poisoning from contaminated meat.",
      "The department on Thursday said it was withdrawing a rule proposed in August after three years of development. Officials with the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service cited feedback from more than 7,000 public comments and said they would \u201cevaluate whether it should update\u201d current salmonella regulations.",
      "The rule would have required poultry companies to keep levels of salmonella bacteria under a certain threshold and test for the presence of six strains most associated with illness, including three found in turkey and three in chicken. If the levels exceeded the standard or any of those strains were found, the poultry couldn\u2019t be sold and would be subject to recall, the proposal had said.",
      "The plan aimed to reduce an estimated 125,000 salmonella infections from chicken and 43,000 from turkey each year, according to USDA. Overall, salmonella causes 1.35 million infections a year, most through food, and about 420 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The withdrawal drew praise from the National Chicken Council, an industry trade group, which said the proposed rule was legally unsound, misinterpreted science, would have increased costs and create more food waste, all \u201cwith no meaningful impact on public health.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to further reducing salmonella and fully support food safety regulations and policies that are based on sound science,\u201d said Ashley Peterson, the group's senior vice president of science and regulatory affairs.",
      "But the move drew swift criticism from food safety advocates, including Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who helped draft the plan.",
      "The withdrawal \"sends the clear message that the Make America Healthy Again initiative does not care about the thousands of people who get sick from preventable foodborne salmonella infections linked to poultry,\" Eskin said in a statement.",
      "The proposed rule had been regarded as a food safety victory similar to a 1994 decision to ban certain strains of dangerous E. coli bacteria from ground beef after deadly outbreaks, said Sarah Sorscher, of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Shipping more salmonella to restaurants and grocery stores is certain to make Americans sicker,\u201d Sorscher said.",
      "Earlier this month, the USDA said it would delay by six months the enforcement of a final rule regulating salmonella levels in certain breaded and stuffed raw chicken products. Enforcement, which was set for May 1, now begins Nov. 3.",
      "That covers foods such as frozen chicken cordon bleu and chicken Kiev dishes that appear to be fully cooked but are only heat-treated to set the batter or coating. Such products have been linked to at least 14 salmonella outbreaks and at least 200 illnesses since 1998, according to the CDC.",

      "HALLE, Belgium -- Gilles Gui was looking for the magical purple bluebells that raise their heads each spring under the budding beech leaves of the Hallerbos forest, an annual explosion of color that draws crowds from around the world.",
      "And in these times full of stress and anxiety about wars, economic threats and other tensions, he found something else too: a sense of tranquility.",
      "\u201cI notice that there\u2019s a lot of silence in my head when I\u2019m done,\u201d Gui said. \u201cYeah, it helps me keep some peace in my mind, really just take my mind away from everything that\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "Spending time in nature, experts have long said, can be a balm in troubled times.",
      "\u201cFrom a stroll through a city park to a day spent hiking in the wilderness, exposure to nature has been linked to a host of benefits, including improved attention, lower stress, better mood, reduced risk of psychiatric disorders, and even upticks in empathy and cooperation,\u201d a 2020 article of the American Psychological Association said.",
      "\u201cThese are extraordinary times,\u201d said Ignace Glorieux, a sociology professor at Brussels University, adding that the under-30 generation in particular is under pressure.",
      "\u201cThis is also the generation maybe that suffered most from the COVID crisis,\u201d Glorieux said. \u201cAnd now they come into a situation where there\u2019s a lot of international uncertainty. So especially this group, maybe more than (the older) generation, is suffering from that and feels very uncertain about their future.\u201d",
      "Gui, 26, knows what Glorieux is talking about. \u201cI do know of people my age who are worried and also with financial situations going on, who try to keep level heads, but it\u2019s very hard for them,\u201d he said.",
      "During the pandemic, the bluebell woods were closed off for fear that throngs of people would make it a hive of transmission instead of a haven of peace. Restrictions kept some parks under seal and mandated masks in some others.",
      "\u201cIt was a difficult period for everyone,\u201d said Mark Demesmaeker, a former member of the European Parliament, gardening enthusiast and city councilor in Halle, where he has walked the woods for decades. Now, at least, nature is there to welcome those with anxious minds.",
      "\u201cThese bluebells \u2014 but in other times of year as well, walking here, the forest valleys, the wildlife, the forest streams \u2014 you know, they work into your mind all year round. And it\u2019s really a big green hug that you get here,\u201d Demesmaeker said.",
      "That hug from nature is just about everywhere right now. Japan is awash in a sea of cherry blossoms, which mesmerize people around the world. Bluebell season also coincides with the prime tulip season in the Netherlands. The renowned Keukenhof garden there has become a playground for influencers and those seeking that ultimate selfie.",
      "The Keukenhof and the Dutch tourism board suggest good spots to \u201cmake your image come alive.\u201d",
      "To Glorieux, that's where 21st-century humans push it too far.",
      "\u201cWe have to be busy all the time, even in our leisure time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to perform.\"",
      "Instead, he advised, \u201cFocus! If you go out walking, focus on walking. If you go out jogging, focus only on jogging.\u201d",
      "Such advice was not wasted on Philippe Thiry, 64, a southern Belgian recently retired and ready to embrace the rest of his life. He had no phone as he set off in the sunshine to look for bluebells.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to use it here because I\u2019m here just to relax,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, just to see the flowers and to see, to listen to the birds.\u201d",

      "Novavax makes the nation\u2019s only traditional protein-based COVID-19 vaccine. It is still being sold under emergency use authorization \u2014 unlike mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna that have earned full FDA approval for certain age groups.",

    "story": [
      "The evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say they are seeing and hearing increased worries about flying",
      "NEW YORK -- Adelynn Campbell\u2019s last plane trip ended with a panic attack that she got through largely with the help of a kind flight attendant.",
      "That was last year \u2014 before 67 people died in January when an American Airlines jet collided with a helicopter over Washington, D.C., in the deadliest U.S. air disaster in almost a quarter century.",
      "Now, Campbell is even more hesitant to book a flight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely spiked my concern about getting on a plane and it\u2019s making the whole situation a little more stressful than it used to be,\u201d said Campbell, 30, who manages a coffee shop in San Diego.",
      "Being at least a little nervous about flying is understandable. As Mel Brooks once said: \u201cIf God wanted us to fly, He would have given us tickets.\u201d But for some people it causes deep anxiety that could require professional help.",
      "Here's a look at air travel anxiety and ways to cope with it.",
      "The evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say they\u2019ve seen and heard increased worries \u2014 and not only in people who already had anxieties about flying.",
      "\u201cEven people who didn\u2019t have a fear of flying are talking about it, given recent events,\u201d said Jennifer Dragonette, a California-based psychologist who treats people with air travel anxieties.",
      "U.S. air travel was down in March and early April compared with last year, according to TSA statistics. Airlines have attributed the decline to economic uncertainty, a decline in government and corporate travel and \u2014 yes \u2014 concern about recent aviation incidents.",
      "FAA officials recently acknowledged they weren\u2019t doing enough to ensure air safety. Recent polling by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that fewer Americans report feeling safe about flying this year.",
      "Flight attendants who work planes out of the Washington, D.C., airport were particularly rattled by the January collision, said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants union. Some asked for time off to process their emotions, and at least one flight attendant left the job, she said.",
      "Fear of flying \u2014 sometimes called aerophobia \u2014 goes beyond just being nervous about a flight. It is an intense form of anxiety that centers on certain aspects of air travel. Many aerophobes get most rattled during take-off and landing, or when they think about being locked in a plane.",
      "Some research has suggested it affects about 25 million U.S. adults. Psychologists say it often surfaces in adulthood, developing in people who didn\u2019t mind flying as kids but grew more rattled as they aged.",
      "In many cases, it starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, at a time they are experiencing big life changes and new responsibilities \u2014 like getting married or becoming a parent \u2014 and they start to think that \u201ceverything counts,\u201d said David Carbonell, a Chicago-based psychologist who authored a workbook to help people cope with flying fears.",
      "A bad flight with heavy turbulence or some other problem may trigger an anxiety that persists, he said.",
      "Campbell, who has other forms of anxiety, developed a fear of flying a few years ago. She is transgender, and said travel can be stressful because of concerns about how she\u2019ll be treated by airport security or in other interactions.",
      "Aerophobia can be complicated, Carbonell said. For many people, it\u2019s not so much a fear of crashing as it is claustrophobic feelings of being in an enclosed cabin and not having control.",
      "Campbell said that\u2019s what she experiences: \u201cfeeling trapped and unable to breathe.\u201d",
      "Nelson said flight attendants regularly deal with suffering passengers: \u201cWe\u2019ve had people have panic attacks, and we\u2019ve had to give them oxygen. It can be quite intense.\u201d",
      "Statistics have long shown that airliners are probably the safest way to travel. According to the National Safety Council, the odds of dying in an airplane crash are too low to be calculated, based on 2023 statistics \u2014 making them far, far lower than of being killed in a motor vehicle crash or, for that matter, walking on a sidewalk or crossing a street.",
      "But experts say you can\u2019t really reason your way out of an anxiety disorder.",
      "Carbonell spends little time on statistics, telling patients: \u201cI know you already looked at them all, and they\u2019re not helping you.\u201d",
      "For people with milder levels of aerophobia, deep breathing often works. Longer exhales help the body relax, said Dragonette, who counseled Campbell for aerophobia and other anxiety disorders at a Newport Healthcare residential facility in Temecula, California.",
      "People suffering more extreme cases can be helped with exposure therapy. It can start by simply getting patients to become comfortable looking at photos of planes, watching videos of planes flying safely, or putting on a virtual reality headset that shows recordings of being inside a plane, Dragonette said.",
      "It\u2019s a matter of getting patients to learn to live with their feelings and better handle them.",
      "Carbonell recommends patients take practice flights that do not involve work trips or any other responsibilities. When they have symptoms, he recommends they keep a written inventory.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re keeping a simple count,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re using counting as a proxy for acceptance.\u201d",
      "Nelson, who was a longtime United Airlines flight attendant, says: \u201cI\u2019ve had situations where I\u2019d sort of sit in the aisle and hold someone\u2019s hand.\"",
      "On a Frontier Airlines flight last year from Detroit to San Diego, Campbell tried breathing and other coping skills, but they didn\u2019t halt her panic attack. The passenger next to her noticed she was increasingly anxious, and summoned a flight attendant.",
      "The flight attendant took deep breaths with Campbell and helped her get through it, and also took down Campbell\u2019s phone number and checked on her a day later.",
      "\u201cI was really impressed,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Health officials in the Gaza Strip say more than 400 dialysis patients have died during the 18-month Israel-Hamas war because of lack of proper treatment",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Twice a week, Mohamed Attiya\u2019s wheelchair rattles over Gaza\u2019s scarred roads so he can visit the machine that is keeping him alive.",
      "The 54-year-old makes the journey from a temporary shelter west of Gaza City to Shifa Hospital in the city\u2019s north. There, he receives dialysis for the kidney failure he was diagnosed with nearly 15 years ago. But the treatment, limited by the war's destruction and lack of supplies, is not enough to remove all the waste products from his blood.",
      "\u201cIt just brings you back from death,\u201d the father of six said.",
      "Many others like him have not made it. They are some of Gaza\u2019s quieter deaths from the war, with no explosion, no debris. But the toll is striking: Over 400 patients, representing around 40% of all dialysis cases in the territory, have died during the 18-month conflict because of lack of proper treatment, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "That includes 11 patients who have died since the beginning of March, when Israel sealed the territory's 2 million Palestinians off from all imports, including food, medical supplies and fuel. Israeli officials say the aim is to pressure Hamas to release more hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid, declined to comment on the current blockade. It has said in the past that all medical aid is approved for entry when the crossings are open, and that around 45,400 tons of medical equipment have entered Gaza since the start of the war.",
      "Attiya said he needs at least three dialysis sessions every week, at least four hours each time. Now, his two sessions last two or three hours at most.",
      "Israel\u2019s blockade, and its numerous evacuation orders across much of the territory, have challenged his ability to reach regular care.",
      "He has been displaced at least six times since fleeing his home near the northern town of Beit Hanoun in the first weeks of the war. He first stayed in Rafah in the south, then the central city of Deir al-Balah. When the latest ceasefire took effect in January, he moved again to another school in western Gaza City.",
      "Until recently, Attiya walked to the hospital for dialysis. But he says the limited treatment, and soaring prices for the mineral water he should be drinking, have left him in a wheelchair.",
      "His family wheels him through a Gaza that many find difficult to recognize. Much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "\u201cThere is no transportation. Streets are damaged,\u201d Attiya said. \u201cLife is difficult and expensive.\u201d",
      "He said he now has hallucinations because of the high levels of toxins in his blood.",
      "\u201cThe occupation does not care about the suffering or the sick,\u201d he said, referring to Israel and its soldiers.",
      "Six of the seven dialysis centers in Gaza have been destroyed during the war, the World Health Organization said earlier this year, citing the territory\u2019s Health Ministry. The territory had 182 dialysis machines before the war and now has 102. Twenty-seven of them are in northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people rushed home during the two-month ceasefire.",
      "\u201cThese equipment shortages are exacerbated by zero stock levels of kidney medications,\u201d the WHO said.",
      "Israel has raided hospitals on several occasions during the war, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes. Hospital staff deny the allegations and say the raids have gutted the territory's health care system as it struggles to cope with mass casualties from the war.",
      "The Health Ministry says over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel's offensive, without saying how many were civilians or combatants. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.",
      "At Shifa Hospital, the head of the nephrology and dialysis department, Dr. Ghazi al-Yazigi, said at least 417 patients with kidney failure have died in Gaza during the war because of lack of proper treatment.",
      "That\u2019s from among the 1,100 patients when the war began.",
      "Like Attiya, hundreds of dialysis patients across Gaza are now forced to settle for fewer and shorter sessions each week.",
      "\u201cThis leads to complications such as increased levels of toxins and fluid accumulation \u2026 which could lead to death,\u201d al-Yazigi said.",
      "Mohamed Kamel of Gaza City is a new dialysis patient at the hospital after being diagnosed with kidney failure during the war and beginning treatment this year.",
      "These days, \u201cI feel no improvement after each session,\u201d he said during one of his weekly visits.",
      "The father of six children said he no longer has access to filtered water to drink, and even basic running water is scarce. Israel last month cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory.",
      "Kamel said he has missed many dialysis sessions. Last year, while sheltering in central Gaza, he missed one because of an Israeli bombing in the area. His condition deteriorated, and the next day he was taken by ambulance to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital.",
      "\u201cThe displacement has had consequences,\u201d Kamel said. \u201cI am tired.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The head of the Environmental Protection Agency says his agency will be providing Mexico a list to complete to stop the flow of sewage from Tijuana",
      "SAN DIEGO -- The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that Mexico must stop the flow of billions of gallons of sewage and toxic chemicals from Tijuana that has polluted the Pacific Ocean off neighboring Southern California, closing beaches and sickening Navy SEALs who train in the water.",
      "Lee Zeldin made the demand during an Earth Day trip to the California-Mexico border, where he toured a plant in San Diego County that treats the sewage as a secondary facility and flew along the frontier to see the Tijuana River. He also was scheduled to meet with SEALs.",
      "Zeldin said that in the next day or so, his agency will present Mexico a to-do list of projects to resolve the decades-long environmental crisis, but he stopped short of specifying how the Trump administration would hold Mexico accountable if it does not act.",
      "The problem is \u201ctop of mind\u201d for President Donald Trump, Zeldin said, while adding that they have not talked about possibly imposing tariffs if nothing is done.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to know whether or not Mexico is going to do its part to resolve it, and then we\u2019ll go from there, as far as strategy and tactics,\u201d Zeldin said.",
      "Alicia B\u00e1rcena, Mexico's Environment and Natural Resources secretary, said her country also wants to resolve the problem. She met with Zeldin the previous evening and said they made progress in finding solutions.",
      "\u201cWe are here because we want to solve this,\u201d B\u00e1rcena said in a statement in Spanish. \u201cNot only so there is no untreated wastewater on Mexican beaches, but in the United States as well.\u201d",
      "The 120-mile (195 km)-long Tijuana River runs near the coast in Mexico and crosses into Southern California, where it flows through Navy-owned land and out to the Pacific.",
      "As Tijuana\u2019s wastewater treatment plants have aged and its population and industry have boomed, an increasing amount of toxins have made their way into the river and into San Diego County \u2014 since 2018, more than 100 billion gallons of raw sewage laden with industrial chemicals and trash.",
      "The pollution has sickened not only swimmers, surfers and lifeguards but also schoolchildren, Border Patrol agents and others who do not even go in the water. Scientists say the sewage is vaporized when it foams up and enters the air people breathe.",
      "The Navy is reviewing whether to relocate its training site for SEAL candidates after the Naval Special Warfare Center reported 1,168 cases of acute gastrointestinal illnesses of its recruits from 2019 to 2023.",
      "California beaches near the border have been closed more often than not over the past four years.",
      "Since 2020 more than $653 million in funds have been allocated to address the issue, but the crisis has continued largely because of delays by the Mexican government, Zeldin said. He added that he and Trump are hopeful that will change under the relatively new administration of President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office last October.",
      "Zeldin said that after meeting with Mexico officials in San Diego for 90 minutes, he was left with the impression that Sheinbaum and her environmental secretary want to have a \u201cstrong collaborative relationship.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s being communicated by the new Mexican president is an intense desire to fully resolve this situation,\u201d Zeldin said. But he made clear that he wants Mexico to step up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way that we are going to stand before the people of California and ask them to have more patience and just bear with all of us as we go through the next 10 or 20 or 30 years of being stuck in 12 feet of raw sewage and not getting anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are all out of patience.\u201d",
      "Flanked by lawmakers from both parties, Zeldin noted that cleanup efforts have rare bipartisan support.",
      "Zeldin visited the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant, which was built with funds from both countries to treat 25 million gallons per day as a secondary plant on the U.S. side.",
      "Mexico is working on several wastewater treatment projects to reduce the flow and make major upgrades to its existing plants. B\u00e1rcena said the now-repaired San Antonio de los Buenos plant, which went back to operating at full capacity this month, should make a difference.",
      "But Zeldin said Mexico must complete a number of other projects, including installing floodgates to collect trash in Tijuana. Another one being considered would divert 10 million gallons of sewage away from the shore.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Californians can now buy opioid reversal drugs directly from the state under a program aimed at making the life-saving medication less expensive and more accessible, officials said Monday.",
      "The state began selling its own generic version of Narcan last year for $24 per twin-pack to businesses and local governments, and will now also sell to individual consumers online. A box containing two doses of naloxone nasal spray costs between $45 and $70 from regular pharmacies and online marketplaces.",
      "Opioid overdose deaths, which are caused by heroin, fentanyl and oxycodone, have increased dramatically in California and across the country in recent years, reaching 7,847 in the state in 2023. But California officials say they have started to see a decline in these deaths.",
      "The move is part of a broader push by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to try to force drug companies to lower their prices by offering cheaper, competing versions of medication under the state's CalRx label.",
      "\u201cLife-saving medications shouldn\u2019t come with a life-altering price tag. CalRx is about making essential drugs like naloxone affordable and accessible for all \u2014 not the privileged few,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.",
      "Naloxone, which can reverse overdoses of opioids, has been available in the U.S. without a prescription since March of 2023, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Narcan, a nasal spray brand produced by the Maryland-based pharmaceutical company Emergent BioSolutions.",
      "California is also working on a plan to make insulin more affordable for residents. The state has an agreement with the nonprofit Civica to produce CalRx-branded insulin used to treat diabetes.",

      "WINDHOEK, Namibia -- Susan de Meyer's horses have different effects on different children. Hyperactive kids learn to be a little quieter around them while nonverbal children are moved to communicate and to bond with them.",
      "De Meyer runs a program in the southern African country of Namibia that harnesses the power but also the gentleness of horses to help children with learning disabilities and conditions like ADHD and autism.",
      "Each weekday morning, de Meyer's dusty paddock just outside the capital, Windhoek, is enlivened by a group of eight to 10 children from one of the special schools she helps. The children ride the horses, groom them, stroke them and often, de Meyer says, talk to them.",
      "De Meyer grew up on a farm surrounded by horses and they've always been part of her life. She said they have a quality that is invaluable: They don't judge the children, no matter how different they are.",
      "\u201cThe horse is the hero in this whole situation because these kids don\u2019t want to be around a lot of people,\" de Meyer said.",
      "De Meyer's program, \"Enabling Through the Horse,\" is supported by the Namibian Equestrian Federation and won an award last year from the International Equestrian Federation because it \u201cunderlines the wonderful characteristics of the horse in exuding sensitivity and intuition.\u201d",
      "Horse therapy has been promoted by autism groups and those that work with children with learning disabilities as having a positive impact. And animal therapy in general has been found to be useful in many instances, like dogs that help military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and therapy cats that are taken to hospitals and nursing homes.",
      "Some survivors of the devastating 2023 Hawaii wildfires found relief in horse therapy while grieving loved ones they had lost.",
      "De Meyer jokes she has \u201ctwo-and-a-half horses.\u201d These include two Arabians \u2014 a white mare named Faranah and a brown gelding, Lansha \u2014 while the \u201chalf\u201d is a miniature horse called Bonzi, who is about head-high for a 5-year-old.",
      "The Arabians are often the most useful for the children's therapy because of their size, de Meyer said.",
      "\u201cIt gives them self-esteem. When they stroke the horse, the therapy starts because this is a very big animal compared to their height, and they are not scared to stroke the horse ... and then to ride it and tell the horse what they want,\u201d she said.",
      "De Meyer works with children with a range of conditions or disabilities, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Down syndrome, those who are nonverbal or touch sensitive, and some who were born with fetal alcohol syndrome and have developmental problems.",
      "She has received interest from other countries in Africa and Asia to start similar programs there.",
      "\u201cThe changes that I\u2019ve seen with the learners are significant,\u201d said Chriszell Louw, a teacher at Dagbreek School, which says it is one of just two government schools in Namibia for children with intellectual disabilities. \u201cWe have a learner that likes to talk a lot. When we come here, she knows she has to keep quiet. She sits in her place.\u201d",
      "\"Some of them you see they are more open, they are happy. Some of them were very scared when they started with the horse riding but now they are very excited. When they hear we\u2019re going to the horses they are very excited and just want to go by themselves,\u201d Louw said.",
      "De Meyer said her program helps with fine-motor skills, gross-motor skills, muscle strengthening, coordination, balance and posture, all important for kids who struggle to sit at a desk at school and learn.",
      "One simple exercise de Meyer has children do when they ride is to let go of the reins and stretch their arms out straight and to the sides, using only their torso and lower body to balance as a groom leads the horse around the paddock.",
      "Some of the kids break out in smiles when they let go and look like they're soaring.",
      "\"We make the world different for these kids,\" de Meyer said.",

      "\u201cThis is just elevating that level of convenience,\u201d he said.",
      "Same-day deliveries can help people get started quicker on antibiotics or COVID-19 treatments when they are sick and see a doctor via telemedicine.",

      "Patients may like convenience, but they like saving money even more.",
      "Same-day deliveries can come with additional fees. People who consider them will want to know whether they are getting a better deal on their medicines, Trczinski said. She noted that this is especially true with so-called maintenance prescriptions that are refilled repeatedly.",
      "People with insurance who are taking those maintenance drugs may already have them delivered, noted Andrew Mulcahy, a senior health economist with the nonprofit research organization RAND Corp.",
      "\u201cThe practical implications of these kinds of programs will be very muted,\u201d he said.",
      "Customers also will have to trust that their regular prescriptions get delivered on time and are covered by their health insurer, especially if they switch pharmacies for deliveries. Some pharmacy benefit managers limit coverage outside certain pharmacies.",
      "Drugstore pharmacists also have started providing more care and working with customers to manage conditions like high blood pressure. These things give people more reasons to visit a store.",

      "The best and first step to controlling allergies is avoiding exposure. Keep the windows in your car and your home closed, even when it\u2019s nice outside.",
      "If you go outside, wearing long sleeves can keep pollen off your skin to help ward off allergic reactions, said Dr. James Baker, an allergist at the University of Michigan. It also provides some sun protection, he added.",
      "When you get home, change your clothes and shower daily to ensure all the pollen is off of you \u2014 including your hair. If you can\u2019t wash your hair every day, try covering it when you go outside with a hat or scarf. Don\u2019t get in the bed with your outside clothes on, because the pollen will follow.",
      "It's also useful to rinse your eyes and nose with saline to remove any pollen, experts said. And the same masks that got us through the pandemic can protect you from allergies \u2014 though they won\u2019t help with eye symptoms.",
      "Over-the-counter nasal sprays are among the most effective treatments for seasonal allergies, experts said.",
      "But the vast majority of patients use them incorrectly, irritating parts of the nose, said Dr. Kathleen Mays, an allergist at Augusta University in Georgia. She suggested angling the nozzle outward toward your ear rather than sticking it straight up your nose.",
      "Over-the-counter allergy pills like Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec are helpful, but may not be as effective as quickly since they're taken by mouth, experts said.",
      "Experts also said that if your allergy symptoms are impacting your quality of life, like causing you to lose sleep or a lack focus at work or school, it might be time to consider an allergist appointment for immunotherapies.",
      "Some remedies for allergy relief that have been circulating on social media or suggested by celebrities \u2014 like incorporating local honey into your diet to expose yourself to pollen \u2014 have been debunked.",
      "Dr. Shayam Joshi, an allergist at Oregon Health and Science University, said that's because the flowers that bees pollinate typically don't contain the airborne pollen that causes allergy symptoms.",
      "With climate change, winters are milder and growing seasons are longer, meaning there\u2019s more opportunity for pollen to stay in the air, resulting in longer and more severe allergy seasons.",
      "In many areas across the country, pollen counts have broken decades of records. In late March, the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Center measured a pollen count of over 14,000 grains per cubic meter, which is considered extremely high.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis chose his place of burial in St. Mary Major Basilica, near an icon of the Madonna that he revered, because it reflects his \u201chumble, simple and essential\u2019\u2019 life, the archbishop who administers the basilica told reporters on Friday.",
      "Francis, who died Monday at age 88, will be buried in a niche tomb in the basilica on Saturday after his funeral in St. Peter's Square about 4 kilometers (2\u00bd miles) away.",
      "Francis initially demurred when Archbishop Rolandas Makrickas suggested in May 2022 that he choose St. Mary Major as his last resting place. Makrickas had identified it because of Francis' long association with the basilica, its ties to Francis\u2019 Jesuit order, its artistic and spiritual heritage and links to the papacy. Seven other popes are buried there, but none since 1669.",
      "At first, \"he said no because popes are buried in St. Peter's,\" Makrickas told reporters on the steps of the basilica. \u201cAfter a week, he called me to (his home at the Vatican) Santa Marta and he said \u2018Prepare my tomb.\u2019\"",
      "The pope later insisted that his tomb remain simple, insisting that people should still come to the basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary \u201cto venerate the Madonna, not to see the tomb of a pope,\" Makrickas said.",
      "Francis will be buried beneath a simple headstone made of marble from Liguria, the Italian region of his mother's family, engraved with his name in Latin: Franciscus. Above it will hang a slightly enlarged replica of his pectoral cross, featuring raised images of a shepherd carrying a sheep over his shoulders and a dove, but no other adornments.",
      "The tomb is placed in a niche next to the chapel where the Salus Populi Romani icon that the pope revered is located, and in a part of the basilica that was once a door to an adjacent palace where four popes lived. During his 12-year papacy, Francis would pray before the icon before and after each foreign trip.",
      "The basilica also has significance for the Jesuit pope: It's where the founder of the religious order, St. Ignatius Loyola, celebrated his first Mass on Christmas Day in 1538.",
      "The basilica is a pontifical basilica, one of four in Rome, and has never been \u201cdestroyed, damaged or burned\u201d over the ages, with history dating back to the fifth century. Makrickas called it \u201ca treasure chest of art and spirituality.\"",

      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- The World Food Program says its food stocks in the Gaza Strip have run out under Israel\u2019s nearly 8-week-old blockade, ending a main source of sustenance for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the territory.",
      "The WFP said in a statement that it delivered the last of its stocks to charity kitchens that it supports around Gaza. It said those kitchens are expected to run out of food in the coming days.",
      "Some 80% of Gaza\u2019s population of more than 2 million relies primarily on charity kitchens for food, because other sources have shut down under Israel\u2019s blockade, according to the U.N. The WFP has been supporting 37 kitchens that produced some 500,000 meals a day.",
      "It was not immediately clear how many kitchens would still be operating in Gaza if those shut down.",
      "Israel cut off entry of all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza on March 2 and then resumed its bombardment and ground offensives two weeks later, shattering a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. It says the moves aim to pressure Hamas to release hostages it still holds. Rights groups have called the blockade a \u201cstarvation tactic\u201d and a potential war crime.",
      "Israel has said Gaza has enough supplies after a surge of aid entered during the ceasefire and accuses Hamas of diverting aid for its purposes. Aid workers deny there is significant diversion of aid, saying the U.N. strictly monitors distribution. They say the aid flow during the ceasefire was barely enough to cover the immense needs from throughout the war when only a trickle of supplies got in.",
      "With no new goods entering Gaza, many foods have disappeared from markets, including meat, eggs, fruits, dairy products and many vegetables. Prices for what remains have risen dramatically, becoming unaffordable for much of the population. Most families rely heavily on canned goods.",
      "Malnutrition is already surging. The U.N. said it identified 3,700 children suffering from acute malnutrition in March, up 80% from the month before. At the same time, because of diminishing supplies, aid groups were only able to provide nutritional supplements to some 22,000 children in March, down 70% from February. The supplements are a crucial tool for averting malnutrition.",
      "Almost all bakeries shut down weeks ago and the WFP stopped distribution of food basics to families for lack of supplies. With stocks of most ingredients depleted, charity kitchens generally can only serve meals of pasta or rice with little added.",
      "World Central Kitchen -- a U.S. charity that is one of the biggest in Gaza that doesn\u2019t rely on the WFP -- said Thursday that its kitchens had run out of proteins. Instead, they make stews from canned vegetables. Because fuel is scarce, it dismantles wooden shipping pallets to burn in its stoves, it said. It also runs the only bakery still functioning in Gaza, producing 87,000 loaves of pita a day.",
      "The WFP said 116,000 tons of food is ready to be brought into Gaza if Israel opens the borders, enough to feed 1 million people for four months.",
      "Israel has leveled much of Gaza with its air and ground campaign, vowing to destroy Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. It has killed over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, whose count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.",

He was convicted in 2009 for his part three years earlier in Britain\u2019s biggest armed robbery at a depot in Kent, southeast England, in which 54 million pounds ($72 million at current prices) in cash was stolen, much of which has never been recovered.",
      "Prosecutors said the men had burgled the Museum of Far Eastern Art in Geneva on June 1, 2019, a month before Allen was shot.",
      "Three pieces of Ming-era porcelain were taken from the museum, which had a combined insurance value of around $3.6 million. Investigators also uncovered that the defendants flew to Hong Kong later that month, where they tried to sell one of the items they had stolen \u2014 a phoenix bowl \u2014 at an auction house.",

      "The case against the three men was given further impetus with the discovery in Nov. 2024 of an iPad in the River Thames that was used to track the movements of Allen before he was shot.",
      "\u201cThis attack may look like the plot to a Hollywood blockbuster but the reality is something quite different,\u201d said Detective Superintendent Matt Webb of the Metropolitan Police, who led the investigation. \"This was horrific criminality.\"",

      "Brazil\u2019s former President Fernando Collor was arrested early on Friday in the northeastern state of Alagoas and ordered to begin serving a prison sentence stemming from his 2023 conviction for corruption",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazil\u2019s former President Fernando Collor was arrested early on Friday in the northeastern state of Alagoas and ordered to begin serving a prison sentence stemming from his 2023 conviction for corruption.",
      "Collor was convicted of receiving 20 million reais ($3.5 million) to facilitate contracts between BR Distribuidora, a fuel distributor formerly controlled by the state-owned oil company Petrobras, and construction firm UTC Engenharia for the construction of fuel distribution bases. In return, he offered political support for the appointment of executives at BR Distribuidora when it was still state-owned.",
      "Collor, who led the country from 1990 to 1992, was sentenced to eight years and 10 months, to be served initially in prison, rather than under house arrest.",
      "Under the Brazilian legal system, cases concerning members of Congress, presidents and ministers go directly to the Supreme Court. He was not yet in prison because his lawyers were still lodging appeals.",
      "The case stemmed from the Operation Car Wash, a sweeping corruption probe that has implicated top politicians and businesspeople across Latin America \u2014 including current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who was arrested in 2018 and imprisoned for nearly two years.",
      "Collor, 75, was the first Brazilian president elected by popular vote, in 1989, after a 21-year military dictatorship. He was impeached and removed from office by Congress in 1992 following corruption allegations. In 2007, he was elected as a senator representing his home state of Alagoas in northeastern Brazil.",
      "Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the former president's arrest Thursday, with the full board set to vote on Friday whether to confirm the decision. De Moraes said in his decision that Collor should begin serving his sentence, noting that the former president's lawyers have attempted to drag out proceedings through appeals.",
      "The justice also said that the court had previously ruled in similar cases that, once appeals have no merit, the sentence can be served right away.",
      "Collor's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",

      "India and Pakistan have intensified their hostilities over the hotly contested Kashmir region following a massacre of 26 mostly Indian tourists, which New Delhi linked to Pakistan",
      "NEW DELHI -- India and Pakistan have intensified their hostilities over the hotly contested Kashmir region following a massacre of 26 mostly Indian tourists, which New Delhi linked to Pakistan.",
      "Pakistan denies it was behind Tuesday's attack by gunmen on a group of tourists in Kashmir. Both sides have since escalated the tensions by exchanging diplomatic and trade sanctions against each other and raising fears of a military conflict.",
      "Here are five reasons why a flare-up between India and Pakistan matters:",
      "Under intense domestic pressure, India has hinted at the possibility of a limited military strike on Pakistan in response to what it called the \u201cterror attack\u201d with \u201ccross-border links.\u201d Pakistan made it clear that it will respond militarily to an attack.",
      "This raises fears that an escalation by any one side can lead to a wider war. The last time the two nations came to blows was in 2019, when a suicide car bombing killed 40 Indian soldiers in Kashmir.",
      "In 2021, the sides renewed a ceasefire agreement along their border, which has largely held. That relative calm was broken on Thursday after a brief exchange of fire between their armies.",
      "Both India and Pakistan are armed with nuclear weapons. There are fears that any conventional war or skirmish between them could potentially turn into a nuclear exchange.",
      "India and Pakistan have fought two major wars, in 1965 and 1971, but in 1974, India conducted its first nuclear tests, raising the stakes in any military conflict. It triggered a nuclear race and Pakistan reached that same milestone in 1998.",
      "Since then, India and Pakistan have had one major border skirmish in 1999 that killed at least 1,000 combatants. The fighting only stopped after U.S. intervened.",
      "India and China are geopolitical rivals whose armies clashed along the disputed Himalayan border in 2020. Ties between the Asian giants have improved since but they still maintain large numbers of troops on their borders. Their borders are also contiguous to Pakistan's, making it the world\u2019s only three-way nuclear junction.",
      "Beijing also controls part of the Kashmir region that New Delhi says belong to India.",
      "On the other hand, China is also a main ally of Pakistan and has helped advance its missile programs, creating additional military concerns for New Delhi. Meanwhile, India maintains strong defence ties with the U.S., which has long sought to limit Beijing\u2019s rise in the India-Pacific region.",
      "Experts say any conflict between India and Pakistan is unlikely to stay strictly between them, as their strategic partners are likely to get involved.",
      "In response to the massacre, India suspended a crucial treaty that governs the flow of river waters into Pakistan. Pakistan said it would consider any attempt to stop the flow of water from India an \u201cact of war.\"",
      "Under the Indus Water treaty, India is obliged to let six rivers flow freely to Pakistan. If India follows through and restricts the flow, it can have a devastating impact on Pakistan's agriculture as it battles acute water shortages.",
      "It's also also a major environmental issue. Water insecurity is a big concern in both India and Pakistan due to rapidly growing populations and climate change.",
      "Rights groups \u2014 including the U.N. \u2014 have blamed New Delhi for rights violations including civilian killings and arbitrary arrests in Indian-controlled Kashmir as a result of an intense crackdown by Indian forces. It has hurt India's human rights record and raised concerns that global powers are not doing enough to pressure New Delhi and hold it accountable.",
      "Militants fighting against Indian rule have also killed scores of civilians, including Hindu pilgrims.",
      "India has used military response against militants as part of its efforts to eradicate \u201cterrorism,\" saying it threatens regional stability.",

      "Symbolically, the student runners started their marathon journey to Brussels from outside the now-closed central railway station in Novi Sad where tons of concrete crashed without warning on the people standing or strolling underneath on Nov. 1.",
      "Many protesters in Serbia have faced attacks during traffic blockades and were questioned by police in the past months.",
      "The students who cycles to Strasbourg, France, in early April met officials from the Council of Europe and the European Parliament. Once in Brussels, the students hope to meet with the EU Commission and European Parliament officials.",

      "SRINAGAR, India -- Indian officials said the army had a brief exchange of fire with Pakistani soldiers along their highly militarized frontier in the Himalayan region of Kashmir, as the nuclear-armed rivals ramped up tit-for-tat diplomatic offensive following a deadly attack on tourists in the disputed area.",
      "The report of a gunfight comes amid soaring tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad after gunmen killed 26 people near the resort town of Pahalgam in Kashmir on Tuesday. India immediately described the massacre a \u201cterror attack\u201d and said it had \u201ccross border\u201d links, blaming Pakistan for backing it.",
      "Pakistan denied any connection to the attack, which was claimed by a previously unknown militant group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance.",
      "Three Indian army officials said that Pakistani soldiers used small arms to fire at an Indian position in Kashmir late Thursday. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with departmental policy, said Indian soldiers retaliated and no casualties were reported.",
      "In Pakistan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday decline to confirm or deny the report. Ministry spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan told a news conference that \u201cI will wait for a formal confirmation from the military before I make any comment.\"",
      "He added there had been no effort yet from any other country to mediate.",
      "In the past, each side has accused the other of starting border skirmishes in Kashmir, which both claim in its entirety.",
      "The United Nations has urged India and Pakistan \u201cto exercise maximum restraint and to ensure that the situation and the developments we\u2019ve seen do not deteriorate any further.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny issues between Pakistan and India, we believe can be and should be resolved peacefully, through meaningful, mutual engagement,\u201d the statement said Friday.",
      "Following the attack, India announced a series of diplomatic actions against Pakistan.",
      "New Delhi on Wednesday suspended a crucial water-sharing treaty that has withstood two wars between the two countries and closed the only functional land border crossing between the countries while also cutting the number of diplomatic staff. A day later, India revoked all visas issued to Pakistani nationals with effect from Sunday.",

      "Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program will return Saturday to the secluded sultanate of Oman",
      "MUSCAT, Oman -- Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program will return Saturday to the secluded sultanate of Oman, where experts on both sides will start hammering the technical details of any possible deal.",
      "The talks seek to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic closing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Neither Iran nor the U.S. have offered any explanation on why the talks will return to the Omani capital of Muscat, nestled in the Hajar Mountains. Oman has been a mediator between the countries. Last weekend's talks in Rome offered a more-equal flight distance between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, who are leading the negotiations.",
      "But Rome remains in mourning after the death of Pope Francis, whose funeral will be Saturday. And Iranian state television, in covering last weekend's talks, complained at length on air about the \u201cpaparazzi\u201d gathered across the street from the Omani Embassy in Rome's Camilluccia neighborhood.",
      "\u201cAs you can see, unlike the first round of talks where the presence of journalists was limited and the Omanis had special management in place to prevent a large and chaotic media presence from disrupting the negotiations, this time in Rome, Italy, that kind of control hasn\u2019t been applied,\u201d said Hosnieh Sadat Shobeiri, an Iranian state TV journalist in gray, all-encompassing chador.",
      "\u201cBecause of the crowd we\u2019re seeing here, with media outlets from various countries \u2014 including some that are anti-Iran \u2014 it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll hear more conflicting reports and news aimed at disrupting the talks coming out of Rome compared to Oman.\u201d",
      "The Muscat talks come as Iran appears to have lined up Chinese and Russian support. Araghchi traveled to Moscow last week and this week visited Beijing.",
      "On Thursday, Chinese, Iran and Russian representatives met the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog that likely will verify compliance with any accord like it did with Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. That deal included China and Russia, as well as France, Germany and the United Kingdom.",
      "However, Iran has greatly restricted the IAEA's inspections \u2014 leading to fears internationally that centrifuges and other nuclear material could be diverted.",
      "The IAEA offered no readout from the talks, but China's state-run Xinhua news agency on Friday described the three nations as saying the agency has \u201cthe necessary potential and expertise to contribute constructively to this process.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina, Russia and Iran emphasized that political and diplomatic engagement based on mutual respect remains the only viable and practical path for resolving the Iran nuclear issue,\u201d the report said. It added that China respects Iran's \u201cright to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has kept France, Germany and the U.K. out of its direct negotiations with Iran, something similarly reflected in Witkoff's negotiations with Russia over ending its war on Ukraine.",
      "Araghchi meanwhile has said he's open to visiting Berlin, London and Paris to discuss the negotiations.",
      "\u201cThe ball is now in the E3\u2019s court,\u201d Araghchi wrote on the social platform X on Thursday, using an acronym for the countries. \u201cThey have an opportunity to do away with the grip of Special Interest groups and forge a different path. How we act at this critical junction is likely to define the foreseeable future.\u201d",
      "The U.S. technical team was expected to arrive in Oman on Friday ahead of the talks Saturday. They'll be led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's policy planning staff. Anton does not have the nuclear policy experience of those who led America's efforts in the 2015 talks. However, he was an early supporter of Trump, describing the 2016 election as a \u201ccharge the cockpit or you die\u201d vote.",
      "\u201cA Hillary Clinton presidency is Russian Roulette with a semi-auto,\u201d Anton wrote. \u201cWith Trump, at least you can spin the cylinder and take your chances.\u201d",
      "He also criticized \u201cIran sycophancy\u201d in the same essay.",
      "Rubio, speaking on a podcast released this week, also kept up a Trump line that Iran needed to stop its enrichment of uranium entirely.",
      "\u201cIf Iran wants a civil nuclear program, they can have one just like many other countries can have one, and that is they import enriched material,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "But Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. Witkoff also has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop.",
      "Meanwhile, one more wildcard is Israel, whose devastating war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip grinds on. Trump initially announced the Iran talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his side. But Israel, which for years has targeted Iran's nuclear program with attacks on its facilities and scientists, has kept open the possibility of airstrikes to destroy Tehran's enrichment sites.",
      "On Monday, Israel's military conducted drills preparing for possible new Iranian missile attacks, the country's public broadcaster KAN reported.",
      "\u201cOur security services are on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate response,\u201d Araghchi wrote Wednesday on X.",

      "CANAKKALE, Turkey -- Britain\u2019s Princess Anne, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister and Australia\u2019s governor-general gathered near the World War I battlefields on Turkey\u2019s Gallipoli Peninsula at a dawn ceremony Friday to remember the Australian and New Zealand soldiers who lost their lives in a tragic campaign 110 years ago.",
      "The gathering took place near a beach where the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, or Anzacs, first landed at Gallipoli at dawn on April 25, 1915.",
      "As the sun began to rise, the ceremony in northwest Turkey kicked off with a mournful Mauri lament, setting the tone for a solemn observance that included prayers and the laying of wreaths.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister Christopher Luxon spoke of the human cost of war and the importance of preventing conflict in the future.",
      "\u201cAnzac troops came ashore here shoulder-to-shoulder with their brothers from half a world away. Some anticipated adventure far from home. But as the sun rose and the shadows drained from the gullies, it was not adventure that greeted them, but horror,\u201d Luxon said.",
      "\u201cIt would be a disservice to those whose valor we remember, if we forget the real lesson of this campaign: That we should do all we can \u2014 all we can \u2014 to prevent anything like it happening again,\u201d he added.",
      "The campaign, part of a British-led effort to defeat the Ottoman Empire, ultimately failed, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths on both sides during the eight-month conflict. It aimed to secure a naval route from the Mediterranean Sea to Istanbul through the Dardanelles, and knock the Ottomans out of the war.",
      "As in previous years, travelers from Australian and New Zealanders camped overnight at the site which is now known as Anzac Cove, to attend the dawn service.",
      "Among them was 61-year-old Glen Lancaster, from Melbourne, Australia, whose great-uncle participated in the Gallipoli landings.",
      "Lancaster expressed both \u201cexcitement and sadness for what happened. (I\u2019m) amazed at how those men must have felt coming up the beach.\u201d",
      "Anne, the sister of King Charles III, and president of the Commonwealth Graves Commission, read from letters some soldiers wrote home and paid tribute to the soldiers on both sides of the conflict.",
      "\u201cThis was the start of an eight months long campaign, costing and changing the lives of tens of thousands of Australians (and) New Zealand, British, French and Ottoman soldiers,\u201d she said.",
      "She also paid respect to Australian and New Zealand troops involved in various conflicts and peacekeeping missions since Gallipoli.",
      "On Thursday, Anne attended separate ceremonies honoring British and French soldiers.",
      "The battle helped forge Australia and New Zealand\u2019s national identities as well as friendship with their former adversary, Turkey.",
      "The campaign is an important part of Turkish history. Modern Turkey\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk rose to prominence as commander of the Turkish forces at Gallipoli, went on to lead Turkey\u2019s War of Independence and ultimately found the Turkish Republic.",
      "Turkish army Lt. lieutenant colonel Ozkan Celik read from a message Ataturk dedicated to the mothers of the soldiers who died: \u201cYou, the mothers who sent their sons from faraway countries, wipe away your tears; your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace.

      "BANGUI, Central African Republic -- Central African Republic\u2019s capital had been torn apart by inter-religious violence leading up to Pope Francis\u2019 2015 visit, its streets haunted by fear and division.",
      "Yet, there was the open-air popemobile driving through a Muslim-majority neighborhood of Bangui, a zone off-limits to Christians, with the pope crossing a line many feared amid a yearslong civil war.",
      "An imam at his side, Francis removed his shoes, bowed his head and entered a mosque, imploring people to \"say \u2018no\u2019 to hatred, vengeance and violence, especially that committed in the name of a religion or God.\u201d",
      "The episode is being recalled by Catholics as they weigh the pontiff\u2019s legacy throughout Africa, a continent where the faith is growing rapidly and where, unlike Francis, the priesthood leans deeply conservative.",
      "Priests and parishioners who spoke to The Associated Press from Morocco to South Africa remembered Francis' commitment to the marginalized, including victims of violence, poverty or the enduring structures borne from colonialism.",
      "\"Christians and Muslims who used to stare at each other were reconciled,\" Ella Carine Kossingou, a Bangui resident, said of Francis' visit. \u201cI\u2019m not Catholic, but I won\u2019t forget his presence in our country.\"",
      "Following the announcement of his death, a graffiti artist dabbed finishing touches onto a portrait of Pope Francis in Kenya. In Nigeria, parishioners lined up to sign a condolence book beneath his portrait. And in South Sudan, Father James Rombe knelt to pray along with students at the St. Lawrence Minor Seminary.",
      "\u201cHe taught our leaders a big lesson on humility, and what it means to be a servant \u2014 a servant leader,\u201d Rombe said, remembering when Francis kissed the feet of warring South Sudan leaders as government troops battled rebels in parts of the country.",
      "\u201cThat was the powerful message that we all received from him: Hope. To be hopeful. And these two words always go together: hope and peace,\u201d Rombe added.",
      "Throughout his 12-year pontificate, Francis visited 10 African countries, seven more than his predecessor. He spoke of \u201cthe wisdom found in poor neighborhoods,\u201d in a Kenyan slum, preached fraternity across religion divides in Morocco and condemned foreign plunder in Democratic Republic of Congo.",
      "The late pope \u201cwas very unambiguous in telling world powers to stop exploiting Africans,\u201d said Father Michael Nsikak Umoh, spokesperson for the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria.",
      "African ministers who clashed with Francis' stances on same-sex couples remembered him this week as someone who shared a commitment to justice, rather than someone with whom they disagreed. A priest in Cameroon told Catholic media that Francis was a \u201cpost-colonial pope.\u201d In Mozambique, another recalled his ministry in the aftermath of natural disasters.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that he would want to be painted liberal or conservative. What he wanted to do was to walk a line between church teaching and the experience of people,\u201d said Father Hugh Patrick O\u2019Connor of the South African Council of Churches.",
      "That line, however, often frayed at the edges.",
      "African bishops\u2019 conferences, largely among the church\u2019s most conservative, pushed back against Francis' positions. After he issued an edict allowing priests to bless same-sex couples, Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, Archbishop of Kinshasa, called for more recognition of perspectives from Africa, which he described as \u201cthe future of the Church.\u201d",
      "The Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa, led by Cardinal Ambongo, and Zimbabwe\u2019s Catholic bishops were among the conferences that disavowed Francis\u2019 stance on same-sex couples. Despite those differences, Father Tryvis Moyo, the conference\u2019s secretary-general, remembered him as a \u201cfaithful shepherd who did not just become leader of the church, but became the conscience of the world.\u201d",
      "Moyo highlighted Francis\u2019 commitment to doctrine and gospel while holding steadfast to his conference\u2019s stance against blessing same-sex couples.",
      "\u201cHe was not hesitant to say or stand up for what he believed in,\u201d Moyo said of Francis.",
      "Francis led the church as Catholicism experienced rapid growth throughout Africa, including in places where ministries provide health and social services to communities below the poverty line.",
      "More than 281 million Catholics live across Africa\u2019s 54 countries, far more than the 185 million when Francis became pope in 2013, according to the Vatican\u2019s latest figures.",
      "Elizabeth Foster, a Tufts University historian and author of \u201cAfrican Catholic,\u201d said that, in addition to a reformer, Francis was also a byproduct of debates that took shape during his youth, when the church was navigating decolonization and Europe\u2019s withdrawal from Africa.",
      "\u201cIn the space of two generations, we\u2019ve gone from a predominantly European church that was exported to Africa to now, where the flow of people has entirely reversed and Africans are coming to Europe to run parishes and the missionary societies that were founded to evangelize Africa,\u201d she said.",
      "Dom Jo\u00e3o Carlos Nunes, Archbishop of Maputo, remembered Francis' ministry in light of Mozambique's floods and cyclones, including when he visited in 2019.",
      "\u201cHe was a man of the Church and also a man of the poor, of those who have no voice or place, those who are left aside. He taught us to welcome, to have a huge heart, to love without measure,\" Nunes said.",

      "The man who would become Pope Francis always bought his shoes in the same place",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- The man who would become Pope Francis always bought his shoes in the same small store. And now, the remarkably ordinary footwear that surprised and charmed millions has brought pride to his old Buenos Aires neighborhood \u2014 and his cobbler.",
      "The simple black shoes \u2014 a stark contrast to the flashy ruby red slippers of Francis' predecessor, former Pope Benedict XVI \u2014 are among the pope's personal effects that have captured attention as his death this week triggers an outpouring of emotion around the Roman Catholic world.",
      "The seemingly comfortable loafers offer a powerful reminder of Francis' humility, simplicity and lack of ceremony that helped him relate to ordinary people wherever he went.",
      "The Muglia family men were the first cobblers in the middle-class Flores neighborhood of western Buenos Aires. Their shop, Muglia Shoes, opened in 1945, just a few years after Pope Francis was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio to Italian immigrant parents.",
      "There wasn't much competition, so when a young Bergoglio came in to buy shoes, it was Juan Jose Muglia's grandfather who sold him the first pair. Bergoglio was in his 20s then, serving as a Jesuit priest at the Basilica of San Jos\u00e9 de Flores just around the block.",
      "\u201cMy father, my grandfather, they told me stories about how Father Jorge came from the church around the corner to buy these shoes, they were the ones he liked, he wore them all the time,\u201d Muglia, 52, told The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey're simple, it's the kind of shoes that waiters like to wear today, Muglia said, holding up a pair of the handmade lace-up loafers. \"They can last you years and years.\"",
      "When Muglia took over after his father's death, he added a poster of Elvis Presley, a Harley Davidson motorbike and a vinyl turntable to give the place a hipster note.",
      "The racks now display newer fashions like pointy boat shoes and bright patent leather numbers.",
      "But much of the shop remains the same, including the pinewood-paneled walls, floor-to-ceiling shelves of cream-colored shoeboxes and, of course, the leather black loafers with grippy, nonslip soles that Francis repeatedly purchased, inspiring local Catholic priests to do the same.",
      "\"Priests came here from all the basilicas in the city, some young priests even came from Rome to buy them,\u201d said Muglia.",
      "They sell for around $170 today \u2014 far more than the price-tag Francis saw \u2014 due to Argentina's runaway inflation.",
      "When Francis became pope in 2013, Muglia said he offered to send the pontiff off to St. Peter\u2019s with a new pair of his favorite shoes. But he recalled Francis saying that his feet had become too swollen in his old age and he needed to find a more customized fit that he could depend on in Rome.",
      "Rather than adopt the typical papal shoes \u2014 red velvet or silk \u2014 as pope, Francis didn't stray from his Flores roots.",
      "He chose normal black shoes with an orthopedic sole \u2014 a far cry from the Byzantine era, when pilgrims customarily kissed a decorative cross embroidered on the papal shoe, and from the era of Pope Benedict, whose bespoke leather slippers in a succulent tomato red prompted Esquire Magazine to name the former pontiff \u201cAccessorizer of the Year\u201d in 2007, prompting intense speculation about the designer brand.",
      "As years passed, beyond the occasional priest or parishioner who dropped into Muglia Shoes, few ever wondered about the brand of Francis\u2019 plain footwear.",
      "But that changed when Francis died on Monday at the age of 88, setting off a frenzy of interest about his Flores roots. Around the world, Francis was remembered for paring down the papacy's inherited pomp to become more accessible \u2014 swapping the fur-trimmed velvet cape that popes had worn since the Renaissance for a simple white cassock, and preferring a Ford Focus to the usual papal limo.",
      "As word spread about his original footwear and local journalists flooded the neighborhood, Muglia said curious customers have bombarded him with requests. He placed a framed portrait of Francis prominently in his window.",
      "\u201cIt was a world of people,\" Muglia said. \u201cThey came from everywhere.\"",
      "In Flores, the mourning for Francis feels personal. Residents remember him as someone who lived frugally, visited and advocated for the city's poorest and could often be found sharing Argentina's signature yerba mat\u00e9 drink with old friends and strangers.",
      "At the newspaper stand just down the block from Muglia Shoes, vendor Antonio Plastina, 69, recalled how he and Francis made small-talk \u201clike any two Argentines, a bit of this and that, some politics mixed with soccer.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was a marvelous person, those are beautiful memories,\u201d Plastina said, his eyes welling up. After becoming archbishop and cardinal, Francis still made the half-hour drive to Flores from downtown Buenos Aires every Sunday before church.",
      "He always bought the two main Argentine daily papers, Plastina said, and read the news with a cup of coffee at the quiet cafe across the street, now a mattress store on a traffic-clogged intersection.",
      "Although the crowds that poured into Flores upon learning of Francis' death largely tapered out by Thursday, they left a mass of bouquets and handwritten notes to their beloved pontiff at the iron-barred windows of Membrillar 531, the modest house where Francis grew up as the eldest of five siblings.",
      "\u201cMy vision is going but my memory is long,\u201d said Alicia Gigante, 91, Francis' neighbor and family friend, who stopped at the house on Thursday morning, leaning on her daughter for support.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll remember him for a long time, always his kindness, his smile, and that greeting, when you rang the doorbell and he came out into the street,\" she said, her voice trembling. \u201cThere he was, always the same, he would caress you and bless you.\u201d",

      "Karin Keller-Sutter, in an interview with broadcaster SRF published Friday, said she was \u201csatisfied\u201d with talks in Washington this week that included an International Monetary Fund conference and her one-on-one meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Keller-Sutter also serves as Switzerland\u2019s finance minister.",
      "\u201cThe United States has defined a group of 15 countries with which it wants to find ... a quick solution in this tariff question. Switzerland is part of this group of these 15 countries,\u201d she told reporters separately late Thursday in Washington.",

      "Before the Trump administration paused some of its most stringent tariff plans, products imported from Switzerland had been set to face tariffs of 31% \u2014 more than the 20% tariffs on goods from the European Union. Switzerland is not a member of the 27-country bloc.",
      "According to figures published by the Swiss Embassy in Washington, the U.S. has been Switzerland\u2019s most important goods export market worldwide since 2021, while Switzerland is the fourth most important export market for U.S. services. The bilateral trade volume in goods and services between Switzerland and the U.S. reached a total of $185.9 billion in 2023, the embassy says on its website.",
      "Keller-Sutter said a memorandum of understanding was to be drawn up after which negotiations can begin. A document would also lay out the most important topics, and \u201cwe have also been assigned a specific contact person. This is not easy in the U.S. administration,\u201d she was quoted as saying.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. authorities have clearly expressed their desire to find a solution with Switzerland,\u201d Keller-Sutter told SRF. She said no timetable had been set, but the two sides agreed to move forward quickly \u201cbecause uncertainty is poison for the economy.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s sweeping \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs on April 2 set off turmoil in world stock markets. A week later, Trump spoke by phone with Keller-Sutter in a conversation that her office said focused on tariffs. She emphasized the \u201cimportant role of Swiss companies and investments\" in the U.S.",
      "Hours later, Trump announced the U-turn that paused the steep new tariffs on about 60 countries for 90 days, fanning speculation \u2014 which was not confirmed \u2014 in some Swiss media that her chat with Trump might have played a role in the change of course.",
      "On Thursday, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis, during a trip to Beijing, said the U.S. tariffs have thrust the affected countries into \u201ca sort of coalition\u201d to try to reach a deal with the United States. And on Monday, Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Roche announced plans to invest $50 billion in the U.S. over the next five years \u2014 an unspecified amount of which has already been under way.",

      "Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has called his bribery indictment \u201cunjust\u201d and accused prosecutors of abusing their power in what he called a politically motivated investigation",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Friday called his indictment on bribery charges \u201cunjust,\u201d accusing prosecutors of abusing their power in what he called a politically motivated investigation.",
      "Moon\u2019s comments came a day after prosecutors in the southern city of Jeonju announced his indictment over allegations that a budget airline gave his son-in-law a lucrative no-show job during his presidency.",
      "Meeting with National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik, Moon said he feels that prosecutors are \u201cpushing forward in a predetermined direction, no matter what\u201d and that his case was an example of \u201chow politicized the prosecution has become and how prosecutorial power is being abused.\u201d The former liberal leader was visiting the National Assembly for an event marking the seventh anniversary of his 2018 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, held during a brief period of engagement between the rival Koreas.",
      "Moon\u2019s indictment adds to a long list of South Korean leaders who have faced criminal allegations or scandals near the end of their terms or after leaving office. On June 3 South Korea will hold a presidential election to select a successor to conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was recently removed from office over an ill-conceived imposition of martial law in December.",
      "Yoon, who previously served as prosecutor general under the Moon administration before a high-profile fallout with the liberal leadership, is now facing a criminal trial on rebellion charges related to the decree.",
      "Moon\u2019s political allies at the main opposition Democratic Party have portrayed the indictment as a political vendetta, pushed by Yoon\u2019s supporters at the prosecution service to humiliate the former liberal leader ahead of the election.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Moon, who served as president from 2017-2022, received bribes totaling 217 million won ($151,000) from Lee Sang-jik, founder of the budget carrier Thai Eastar Jet. The bribes were allegedly in the form of financial support for Moon\u2019s son-in-law between 2018-2020.",
      "Prosecutors say the man, who reportedly divorced Moon\u2019s daughter in 2021, was hired by Lee\u2019s company in Thailand despite having no experience in the airline industry, and performed minimal duties while claiming to work remotely from South Korea.",
      "Prosecutors said they had not found evidence that Moon directly arranged political favors for Lee, but that Lee, who worked on Moon\u2019s campaign, likely expected his assistance to be repaid. Lee was later named the head of the state-funded Korea Small and Medium Enterprises and Startups Agency and was nominated by Moon\u2019s party to run for parliament while Moon was in office.",

      "Trump\u2019s attacks on Canada\u2019s economy and threats to make it the 51st state have infuriated Canadians, who are canceling trips to the U.S. in big numbers",
      "VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Diana and Rick Bellamy initially planned to take a Caribbean cruise out of Houston before heading to Laurel, Mississippi, to visit the home of one of their favorite HGTV shows, \u201cHome Town.\u201d",
      "The Calgary couple scrapped those plans and vacationed last month along Mexico's Pacific coast instead, put off by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with Canada, the insults he's hurled at their homeland, and stories about American border agents searching people's phones and detaining foreigners for minor reasons.",
      "She found it ironic that she felt more comfortable traveling to Mexico than the U.S.",
      "\u201cI never thought I would hear myself say that,\u201d Diane Bellamy said.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on Canada\u2019s economy and threats to make it the 51st state have infuriated Canadians, who are canceling trips to the U.S. in big numbers. They also seem to have also flipped the narrative heading into Canada's parliamentary elections on Monday, with Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal Party surging after trailing far behind in the polls just a few months ago.",
      "The U.S. gets more visitors from Canada each year than from any other country, according to the U.S. Travel Association, an industry trade group, which said the 20.4 million visits from Canada last year generated $20.5 billion in spending.",
      "But there has been a big drop in foreigners traveling to the U.S. since Trump took office, and Canadians are no exception. There were more than 910,000 fewer land border crossings from Canada into the U.S. last month than in March of 2024 \u2014 a more than 22% drop \u2014 according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. An Air Canada spokesman, meanwhile, said Canada-U.S. flight bookings for April through September are down about 10%.",
      "Trump brushed aside the decline in tourism to the United States on Wednesday, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a little nationalism there I guess, perhaps. It\u2019s not a big deal.\"",
      "Since Trump started his second term, there have been well-publicized reports of tourists being stopped at U.S. border crossings and held for weeks at immigration detention facilities before being allowed to fly home at their own expense.",
      "On March 3, Canadian Jasmine Mooney, an actor and entrepreneur on a U.S. work visa, was detained by U.S. border agents in San Diego. She was released after 12 days detention.",
      "Before Mooney\u2019s release, British Columbia Premier David Eby expressed concern, saying: \u201cIt certainly reinforces anxiety that ... many Canadians have about our relationship with the U.S. right now, and the unpredictability of this administration and its actions.\u201d",
      "The Canadian Association of University Teachers, which represents faculty and staff at Canadian universities, warned its members against nonessential travel to the U.S. due to the \u201cpolitical landscape\u201d under Trump and reports of Canadians encountering difficulties crossing the border.",
      "Academics who have expressed negative views about the Trump administration should be particularly cautious about traveling to the U.S., said the group.",
      "\u201cPeople are scared to cross the border. I don\u2019t know what Americans are thinking, quite frankly. Are they that oblivious?\u201d said former Quebec Premier Jean Charest, who has family in Florida.",
      "Mike Sauer, who runs a community policing center in Vancouver, said he and his partner have no interest in traveling to the U.S. now because of Trump\u2019s politics and border fears. One of Sauer\u2019s concerns is that if a border guard were to check his cellphone, the guard might see his past purchases of marijuana, which is legal to buy in Canada and about half the 50 states but is still illegal under U.S. federal law.",
      "\u201cThe States have a different view on drugs. They could certainly look at my phone and see I\u2019m 420-friendly,\u201d he said, meaning he\u2019s marijuana-friendly. \u201cI think it kind of depends on which border guard would have a problem with that and which ones wouldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Dietra Wilson, 32, said when she was younger, she often visited Detroit, which is just across the border from Windsor, Ontario, where she and her husband, Ben, own a secondhand shop. She hasn\u2019t visited much in recent years, though, and she said she's heard of people's worries about crossing the border since Trump moved back into the White House.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s worrisome,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben Wilson, 37, also has qualms about trying to cross.",
      "\u201cWhy would I want to?\u201d he said. \u201cRegardless of the tariffs, if I\u2019m going to be stopped at the border for my phone or something somebody texted me, why go?\u201d",
      "The drop in Canadian tourism to the U.S. led California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a frequent target of Trump, to announce an ad campaign this month meant to lure Canadians back to his state, citing a 12% year-on-year drop in February.",
      "McKenzie McMillan, a consultant with a Vancouver-based travel agency, The Travel Group, said the company's bookings to the U.S. have dried up. \u201cWe have seen a near-total collapse of U.S. business,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably about a 90% drop since February.\u201d",
      "Lesley Keyter, the CEO and founder of the Travel Lady agency in Calgary, said she\u2019s seen people actually forfeit money to cancel their U.S. trips.",
      "\u201cEven if they\u2019re going on a Caribbean cruise, they don\u2019t want to go down to Fort Lauderdale to get on the cruise ship,\u201d she said.",

      "Signs are that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on auto imports is causing companies to recalibrate their strategies, and in some cases find new opportunities.",

      "\u201cIn the past, supply chains usually would run like Swiss clockwork, but now it's the opposite,\u201d said Ernesto Barcelo, chief ESG officer for metal components maker Gestamp, said of the uncertainty now dominating the market.",
      "\"The lack of stability now, it's something very ... fluffy,\" Barcelo said.",
      "A fundamental criteria for investing in any market is political stability, Wei Jianjun, chairman of Great Wall Motor Co., told reporters when asked about his company's plans to expand manufacturing overseas. That applies to countries like Hungary, where the company has not yet decided on whether to build a factory, he said, but also to the United States under Trump.",

      "With U.S. tariffs so high, Great Wall can focus elsewhere, such as on trade between China and Europe, which is bound to grow, he said. He didn't address the issue of the tariffs of up 45.3% that the EU has imposed on electric vehicles made in China.",

Now the company based in central China's Wuhan acts as a consultant and allows foreign customers to adapt software to local requirements, said Ye Xiongfei, general manager for the company's autonomous driving division.",

      "Some attending the show said they believe that ultimately Trump will end up softening his stance.",
      "\u201cTrump is a businessman and he hopes to boost the U.S. economy by imposing tariffs on other countries, but I do believe those measures are temporary,\u201d said Yang Jingdi, assistant to the CEO of LvXiang Automobile Parts Co., which makes electronics including rearview mirrors and pumps.",

      "The German government is forecasting the country\u2019s economy, Europe\u2019s biggest, will stagnate this year as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and trade threats weigh on its performance",
      "BERLIN -- The German government forecast Thursday that the country's economy, Europe's biggest, will stagnate this year as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and trade threats weigh on its performance following months of political uncertainty.",
      "Outgoing Economy Minister Robert Habeck said the government cut its 2025 outlook to zero from the modest growth of 0.3% it predicted at the end of January. For next year, it is forecasting growth of 1%, slightly lower than the 1.1% it predicted three months ago.",
      "\u201cThere is above all one reason for this, namely Donald Trump's trade policy and the effects of the trade policy on Germany,\u201d Habeck told reporters in Berlin. He noted that Germany also hasn't had a government with a parliamentary majority to set policy since early November, and the new government isn't yet in place after an election in February.",
      "Germany hasn\u2019t seen significant economic growth in five years. The country for years expanded exports and dominated world trade in engineered products like industrial machinery and luxury cars.",
      "But it\u2019s suffered from increasing competition from Chinese companies, along with many other factors, and the economy contracted in each of the last two years.",
      "Trump's tariffs have added a further risk to German exports. Last year, the United States was Germany\u2019s biggest single trading partner for the first time since 2015, displacing China from the top spot as exports to the Asian power declined.",
      "The German parliament plans to meet on May 6 to elect Friedrich Merz as the country\u2019s next leader, if all the parties in his proposed government approve a coalition agreement reached earlier this month.",
      "Last month already, the prospective partners pushed plans through parliament to enable higher defense spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt and to set up a huge infrastructure fund that\u2019s aimed at boosting the economy.",

    "story": [
      "A new AP-NORC poll suggests Americans\u2019 trust in President Donald Trump to bolster the U.S. economy appears to be faltering",
      "WASHINGTON -- Americans\u2019 trust in President Donald Trump to bolster the U.S. economy appears to be faltering, with a new poll showing that many people fear the country is being steered into a recession and that the president\u2019s broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise.",
      "Roughly half of U.S. adults say that Trump\u2019s trade policies will increase prices \u201ca lot\u201d and another 3 in 10 think prices could go up \u201csomewhat,\u201d according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "About half of Americans are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the possibility of the U.S. economy going into a recession in the next few months.",
      "While skepticism about tariffs is increasing modestly, that doesn\u2019t mean the public is automatically rejecting Trump or his approach to trade. However, the wariness could cause problems for a president who promised voters he could quickly fix inflation.",
      "Three months into his second term, Trump\u2019s handling of the economy and tariffs is showing up as a potential weakness. About 4 in 10 Americans approve of the way the Republican president is handling the economy and trade negotiations. That\u2019s roughly in line with an AP-NORC poll conducted in March.",
      "Matthew Wood, 41, said he\u2019s waiting to see how the tariffs play out, but he\u2019s feeling anxious.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a huge fan of it, especially considering China and going back and forth with adjustments on both ends,\u201d said Wood, who lives in West Liberty, Kentucky, and is unemployed. \u201cPersonally, it hasn\u2019t affected me as of yet. But, generally, I don\u2019t know how this is going to come to an end, especially with the big countries involved.\u201d",
      "Still, Wood said he changed his registration from Republican to independent, having been turned off by Trump\u2019s attitude and deference to billionaire adviser Elon Musk. Wood voted for Trump last year and said he\u2019s willing to give the president until the end of the year to deliver positive results on tariffs.",
      "About half of U.S. adults, 52%, are against imposing tariffs on all goods brought into the U.S. from other countries. That\u2019s up slightly from January, when a poll found that 46% were against tariffs. Driving that small shift largely appears to be adults under age 30 who didn\u2019t previously have an opinion on tariffs.",
      "Trump supporter Janice Manis, 63, said her only criticism of Trump on tariffs is that he put in a partial 90-day pause for trade negotiations with other countries.",
      "\u201cActually, I think he shouldn\u2019t have suspended it,\u201d said Manis, a retired sheriff\u2019s deputy from Del Rio, Texas. \u201cBecause now China is trying to manipulate all of these other countries to go against us, whereas if he would have left all the tariffs in play then these countries would be hit hard. But, oh, well, things happen.\u201d",
      "Not quite 100 days into Trump\u2019s second term in the White House, people around the country are bracing for possible disruptions in how they spend, work and live. The U.S. economy remains solid for the moment with moderating inflation and a healthy 4.2% unemployment rate, yet measures such as consumer confidence have dropped sharply.",
      "Trump has used executive actions to remold the global economy. He\u2019s imposed hundreds of billions of dollars a year in new import taxes \u2014 albeit partially suspending some of them \u2014 launching a full-scale trade war against China and pledging to wrap up deals with dozen of other countries that are temporarily facing tariffs of 10%. Financial markets are swinging with every twist and turn from Trump\u2019s tariff pronouncements.",
      "Many Americans are not convinced this is the right approach. About 6 in 10 say Trump has \u201cgone too far\u201d when it comes to imposing new tariffs, according to the poll.",
      "Stocks are down this year, while interest charges on U.S. government bonds have climbed in ways that could make it more costly to repay mortgages, auto loans and student debt. CEOs are scrapping their earnings guidance for investors and seeking exemptions from Trump\u2019s tariffs, which hit allies such as Canada and even penguin-inhabited islands.",
      "Trump seemed to recognize the drag from tariffs as he highlighted this week the possibility of a deal with China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had also said in a closed-door speech that the situation with China is not \u201csustainable.\u201d",
      "About 6 in 10 U.S. adults are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or appliance. Less than half are highly concerned about their ability to purchase the goods they want \u2014 a sign of the economy\u2019s resilience so far.",
      "Retirement savings are a source of anxiety \u2014 about 4 in 10 Americans say their retirement savings are a \u201cmajor source\u201d of stress in their lives. But fewer \u2014 only about 2 in 10 \u2014 identify the stock market as a major source of anxiety.",
      "\u201cThis whole tariff war is just a losing situation not only for the American people but everybody worldwide,\u201d said Nicole Jones, 32. \u201cIt\u2019s revenge \u2014 and everybody\u2019s losing on it.\u201d",
      "The Englewood, Florida, resident voted last year for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced the incumbent president, Joe Biden, as the Democratic nominee. Jones hadn\u2019t given much thought to tariffs until recently, and now, as an occupational therapy student, she also worries about losing her financial aid and facing high amounts of educational debt.",
      "\u201cThings are more expensive for us,\u201d she said.",
      "And most Americans still think the national economy is in a weak state.",
      "The difference is that Republicans \u2014 who largely thought the economy was in bad shape when Biden was president \u2014 now feel more optimistic. But Democrats have become much more bleak about the country\u2019s financial future.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows, but we were doing fine,\u201d Jones, a Democratic voter, said about the economy before Trump\u2019s policies went into effect.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The height of tax season was the height of turmoil at the IRS.",
      "The agency shuffled through three acting directors over the course of a week. It\u2019s preparing to lose tens of thousands of workers to layoffs and voluntary retirements. And President Donald Trump is weighing in on which nonprofits should lose their tax-exempt status, an incursion into the agency\u2019s typically apolitical stance that threatens to further erode trust in federal institutions and weaponize enforcement efforts.",
      "Just three months into Trump's second term, the government's fly-under-the-radar tax collector has become the latest platform for the Republican administration\u2019s vision to cut and control the federal bureaucracy. Tax policy experts fear that taxpayer services and collection efforts will face prolonged delays as a result of the rapid changes.",
      "The quick turnover in leadership and other changes are likely to dampen employee morale at the IRS and hurt the agency\u2019s ability to serve taxpayers in a timely manner, says Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.",
      "\u201cLeadership sets the tone, particularly in this environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Already, she notes, the agency has lost decades of institutional knowledge from nonpartisan career civil servants who have left over policy disagreements and layoffs.",
      "The upheaval unfolded as Americans dutifully filed their taxes ahead of the April 15 deadline and as a legion of IRS employees undertook work to process returns and dole out refunds. The latest filing season data shows the agency accepted more than 117 million returns this tax season and issued $228.7 billion in refunds.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re committed to improving the efficiency of the Internal Revenue Service,\" said the agency's newest acting commissioner, Michael Faulkender. \"For the last 35 years, we\u2019ve been five years away from the IRS being modernized. Under the direct leadership of Treasury, the modernization will be done in two years at a fraction of the cost.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS, like other federal agencies, is hemorrhaging employees over cuts spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, all while the agency churns through acting leaders as it awaits the installation of a permanent leader.",
      "Douglas O'Donnell, the Trump administration's first acting IRS commissioner, announced his retirement in February as furor spread over DOGE gaining access to IRS taxpayer data. Melanie Krause, the second acting commissioner, resigned early this month over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants\u2019 tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Gary Shapley, an IRS whistleblower who testified publicly about investigations into Hunter Biden\u2019s taxes, was acting commissioner for a matter of days before being replaced by Faulkender, who was elevated just last week. The New York Times reported that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had complained to Trump that Shapley had been installed without his knowledge and at the behest of Trump adviser Elon Musk.",
      "Trump's nominee for IRS commissioner, former U.S. Rep. Billy Long of Missouri, is still waiting for a confirmation hearing but faces controversies of his own. Most recently, Senate Democrats have called for a criminal investigation into Long's connections to alleged tax credit loopholes. The lawmakers allege that firms connected to Long duped investors into spending millions of dollars to purchase fake tax credits. Long did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment.",
      "Among other concerns at the agency are fears that Trump will weaponize the IRS against his enemies \u2014 and reward his friends.",
      "Some of the Democratic Party\u2019s core political institutions, including fundraising platform ActBlue and the protest group Indivisible, are preparing for the possibility that the federal government may soon launch criminal investigations against them.",
      "Trump said last week at the White House that the administration is looking at the tax-exempt status of Harvard University, which has defied the government's attempts to limit activism on campus, and environmental groups. He also mentioned the ethics watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a charitable organization,\u201d Trump said of CREW. \u201cThe only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at a lot of things.\u201d",
      "Jonathan S. Masur, an administrative law professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said it's unlawful for the president to unilaterally take away organizations' tax-exempt status.",
      "\u201cIt's illegal for starters. The Supreme Court has established that that step is not allowed,\u201d he said, adding that he anticipates that the court system will \u201cvery quickly block\u201d any such move from the president.",
      "The Trump administration is also watching out for allies of the president.",
      "Treasury official David Eisner sent an email in March to a top IRS official regarding Mike Lindell, the founder of MyPillow and one of the chief proponents of the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018My Pillow guy\u2019 and a high-profile friend of the President recently received an audit letter, from what I understand, his second in two years,\u201d Eisner wrote in the email, which was viewed by the AP. The president \u201cis concerned that he may have been inappropriately targeted,\" Eisner wrote.",
      "Among other changes in recent weeks are concerns about the IRS' engagement with the Department of Homeland Security over enforcing a new data-sharing agreement signed earlier this month by Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The agreement will allow ICE to submit names and addresses of immigrants inside the U.S. illegally to the IRS for cross-verification against tax records.",
      "That agreement is being litigated in federal court.",
      "U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich will soon decide whether to refuse or grant a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups. The groups argue that immigrants in the country illegally who pay taxes are entitled to the same privacy protections as U.S. citizens and immigrants who are legally in the country.",
      "The Treasury Department says the agreement will help carry out Trump\u2019s agenda to secure U.S. borders and is part of his larger nationwide immigration crackdown, which has resulted in deportations, workplace raids and the use of an 18th-century wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants.",
      "Holtzblatt said the agreement is indicative of the turmoil at the IRS.",
      "\u201cThere's an emphasis on improving technology and sharing information,\" but it's unclear for what reason, she said.",

      "This year's show in the sprawling industrial outskirts of Shanghai comes at a pivotal moment. Three decades after Beijing set out to build a world-class auto industry, local manufacturers account for about two-thirds of sales inside China, and a growing share of global exports.",
      "But with U.S. President Donald Trump raising tariffs and the European Union slapping duties on Chinese electric vehicles, selling to some overseas markets is growing increasingly challenging.",
      "\u201cGeopolitics are very complex and the situation remains uncertain,\u201d Wei Jianjun, chairman of Great Wall Motors, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cBut Great Wall is always exploring investments in overseas markets.\u201d",

      "Growth in sales of EVs was offset by falling sales of traditional gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, which still accounted for just over half of new car sales.",
      "Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD nudged past Tesla as the world\u2019s biggest maker of EVs by sales last year, reporting revenue of over $100 billion. It recently announced an ultra fast EV charging system that it says can provide a full charge for its latest EVs within five to eight minutes, about the time needed to fill up at the pump. It plans to build more than 4,000 of the new charging stations across China.",
      "To gain access to China's potentially huge market, foreign automakers like Volkswagen, General Motors, BMW and Ford set up joint ventures with state-owned local companies beginning in the 1980s and '90s, helping them build the capacity and technology to compete on a world scale.",
      "They also created sprawling supply chains in Shanghai and other major manufacturing hubs, helping to nurture other big names in Chinese automaking, such as BYD, Geely and Great Wall Motors.",
      "With growth at home limited by brutal competition, they're expanding rapidly especially in Southeast Asia and other developing economies with relatively affordable sedans, SUVs and pickup trucks.",
      "Shanghai\u2019s auto show is a gathering for the \u201csurvival of the fittest,\u201d said Zhou Lijun, director and chief researcher of the industry analysis group Yiche Research Institute.",
      "That doesn't mean all the EV makers go it alone. BYD teamed up with Daimler, now the Mercedes-Benz Group, to launch its Denza premium brand. It's also challenging Toyota and other top tier brands with its luxury Yangwang brand, priced at up to 2 million yuan ($280,000)",
      "Opening markets wider to foreign competition has given car buyers a choice of more affordable, innovative vehicles. That's a mixed blessing for older automakers like GM, Ford, Toyota and VW that are also fighting a battle of attrition in China.",
      "\u201cChina is still a market worth fighting for,\u201d said Oliver Zipse, chairman of the BMW Group, which like other automakers highlighted a \u201cIn China, for China,\u201d approach, at \u201cChina speed.\u201d",
      "Overhanging the upbeat talk in Shanghai by both Chinese and foreign automakers of manufacturing in China for the world are Trump's tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods, despite a 90-day pause that has spared many other countries, and 25% U.S. tax on imported cars and auto parts.",
      "Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co.'s head of China operations, Stephen Ma, said the company plans to make 10 new battery electric or hybrid models by 2027 in China, for China and for \u201cexport to the world, except one country \u2014 you can guess which one.\"",

      "A report by the Rhodium Group shows that nearly half the world's markets are restricting imports from China, in part because of national security concerns linked to the advanced electronics in EVs and other high-tech vehicles. A minority of countries like Australia and South Africa remain relatively open, and Russia is a major market but is nearly saturated, it says.",
      "Chinese automakers lag behind global leaders like Toyota in conventional gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles, but they can sell EVs at roughly the same price, while also solving the problems of range and fast charging.",
      "China has become part of what geopolitical analyst Yanmei Xie described as a \u201ctechnological paradigm shift\u201d in a commentary in the Japanese financial publication Nikkei Asia.

      "A federal review of helicopter safety around some of the busiest U.S. airports has revealed dangerous flying conditions at the Las Vegas airport",
      "A federal review of helicopter safety around some of the busiest U.S. airports, prompted by the deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and Army helicopter in Washington, D.C., revealed dangerous flying conditions at the Las Vegas airport.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday the potential for a collision between air tour helicopters and planes at Harry Reid International Airport led the agency to make immediate changes to flying rules. In the first three weeks after implementation the number of collision alerts for planes dropped 30%.",
      "The FAA said after the collision between an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter in January, which killed 67 people, that it planned to use artificial intelligence to dig into the millions of reports it collects to assess other places with busy helicopter traffic, including Boston, New York, Baltimore-Washington, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and along the Gulf Coast.",
      "The FAA\u2019s acting administrator, Chris Rocheleau, said Las Vegas quickly became a concern once the agency dug into the data because agreements with helicopter operators there didn\u2019t clearly define vertical and lateral separation requirements when helicopters were approaching the airport. And air traffic controllers in the tower weren\u2019t issuing traffic advisories between returning helicopters and airplanes.",
      "\u201cWe took quick action including exercising positive control over the helicopters and issuing more traffic advisories to pilots,\u201d Rocheleau said. He promised to take additional actions in Las Vegas and at other airports where the FAA identifies concerns.",
      "Luke Nimmo, a spokesperson for Clark County Department of Aviation, referred all questions about the findings to the FAA.",
      "Following the crash of a New York City sightseeing helicopter into the Hudson River that killed six people April 10, the FAA said it was establishing a rulemaking committee to develop recommendations for improving commercial air tour safety.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former National Transportation Safety Board and FAA accident investigator, said the fact that collision alerts for planes dropped so quickly \u201cindicates a real hazard existed before the FAA looked at this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tough to characterize how significant the hazard was,\" he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s yet another hole in the Swiss cheese that can line up with other holes and cause an accident just like what happened in Washington, D.C.\u201d",
      "He said it made sense that the FAA first addressed the Las Vegas airport, given its large mix of helicopters and commercial traffic.",
      "\u201cI think that they will find issues at other airports, but maybe not to the degree that they found with this one,\u201d Guzzetti added.",
      "Former NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said there have long been safety issues with the helicopter tour industry, describing it as slipping in many cases into \u201cbecoming an attraction rather than a safe ride.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately in aviation, it is accidents that bring the attention of the regulators to their responsibilities,\" he added.",
      "The January midair collision near Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport was the deadliest aviation disaster in the United States since 2001. A series of other crashes and near misses in the months since have raised worries about air travel, even though it remains safe overall.",
      "Helicopters have been a key concern, but Rocheleau said the core safety issues remain operations and maintenance problems. He said the top causes of helicopter accidents include loss of control and striking an object during low-altitude operations.",
      "The FAA said its review of the safety data has expanded beyond helicopters to look at airports with a mix of many different planes and airports that are close together.",
      "The proximity between Hollywood Burbank Airport and Van Nuys Airport in the Los Angeles area emerged as a concern because they are less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) apart. Both airports serve a wide mix of aircraft and have arrival and departure paths that are close.",
      "A spokesperson for the Hollywood Burbank Airport referred questions to the FAA. The Van Nuys Airport didn't immediately respond to an email requesting comment.",
      "\u201cWhile flying remains the safest mode of transportation, we must always strive to do better,\u201d Rocheleau said. \u201cWe have to identify trends and get smarter about how we use data. And when we put corrective actions in place, we must execute them.\u201d",
      "Aviation lawyer Robert Clifford, who represents several families of victims of the D.C. plane crash, praised the FAA for taking action to make helicopter flights safer.",
      "\u201cAs a frequent critic of the FAA, I must say that the FAA deserves recognition for taking these steps to protect the traveling public,\" he said. \"Helicopters are known for being the most dangerous and potentially unsafe aircraft. The extra vigilance by the FAA may save many lives.\u201d",

      "U.S. economic growth will come in at just 1.8% this year, down sharply from its previous forecast of 2.7% and a full percentage point below its 2024 expansion. The IMF doesn't expect a U.S. recession, though it has raised its odds of one this year from 25% to 37%.",
      "The forecasts are largely in line with many private-sector economists' expectations, though some do fear a recession is increasingly likely. Economists at JPMorgan say the chances of a U.S. recession are now 60%. The Federal Reserve has also forecast that growth will weaken this year, to 1.7%.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a new era,\u201d Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, chief economist at the IMF, said. \u201cThis global economic system that has operated for the last eighty years is being reset.\u201d",
      "The IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty.",
      "Gourinchas said that the heightened uncertainty around the import taxes led the IMF to take the unusual step of preparing several different scenarios for future growth. Its forecasts were finalized April 4, after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs on nearly 60 countries along with nearly-universal 10% duties.",
      "Those duties were paused April 9 for 90 days. Gourinchas said the pause didn\u2019t substantially change the IMF\u2019s forecasts because the U.S. and China have imposed such steep tariffs on each other since then.",
      "The uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s next moves will also likely weigh heavily on the U.S. and global economies, the IMF said. Companies may pull back on investment and expansion as they wait to see how the trade policies play out, which can slow growth.",
      "China is also forecast to grow more slowly because of U.S. tariffs. The IMF now expects it will expand 4% this year and next, down roughly half a point from its previous forecasts.",
      "While the U.S. economy will likely suffer a \u201csupply shock,\u201d similar to what hampered during the pandemic and which pushed up inflation in 2021 and 2022, Gourinchas said, China is expected to experience reduced demand as U.S. purchases of its exports fall.",
      "Inflation will likely worsen in the United States, rising to about 3% by the end of this year, while it will be little changed in China, the IMF forecast.",
      "The European Union is forecast to grow more slowly, but the hit from tariffs is not as large, in part because it is facing lower U.S. duties than China. In addition, some of the hit from tariffs will be offset by stronger government spending by Germany.",
      "The economies of the 27 countries that use the euro are forecast to expand 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year, down just 0.2% in both years from the IMF\u2019s January forecast.",
      "Japan\u2019s growth forecast has been marked down to 0.6% this year and next, 0.5% and 0.2% lower than in January, respectively.",

    "story": [
      "Plastic is everywhere \u2014 and yet some people may be surprised at how much they actually wear",
      "Bottles and bags, food wrappers and straws. Piping, packaging, toys and trays. Plastic is everywhere \u2014 and yet some people may be surprised at how much they actually wear.",
      "A typical closet is loaded with plastic, woven into polyester activewear, acrylic sweaters, nylon swimsuits and stretchy socks \u2014 and it\u2019s shedding into the environment nonstop.",
      "When garments are worn, washed and put through the dryer, they shed plastic fiber fragments. A single load of laundry can release millions that are so tiny wastewater treatment plants can\u2019t capture them all. They wind up in local waterways that connect to the ocean. Marine animals eat them, and that can pass plastic to larger animals and humans.",
      "Even natural fabrics shed fibers and have chemicals that can leach into the environment. But polyester is the most widely used fiber on Earth, and along with other synthetic fibers accounts for about two-thirds of production worldwide.",
      "Tuesday is Earth Day, when people worldwide contemplate ways to reduce their impact on the planet.",
      "\u201cEveryone who wears and launders clothing is part of this problem but everyone who wears and launders clothing can be part of the solutions,\u201d said Rachael Z. Miller, founder of Vermont-based Rozalia Project for a Clean Ocean.",
      "Simple changes like washing clothes less and using cold water instead of hot can help reduce the shedding of fibers. More challenging is that textiles need to be produced and used in a more sustainable way, said Elisa Tonda at the UN Environment Programme. For example, designing clothes that shed fewer microfibers and are high-quality to last longer, said Tonda, who leads the resources and markets branch.",
      "The easiest solution is to wash clothes less often, making for less of the friction that breaks fibers apart, said Anja Brandon, director of plastics policy at Ocean Conservancy.",
      "\u201cThey get tumbled and tossed around with a bunch of soaps, really designed to shake things up to get out dirt and stains,\u201d Brandon said.",
      "Miller uses a stain stick to spot-clean. Both say that when clothes are washed, they shed less when put in cold water in full loads to reduce friction, on a shorter cycle, then hung to dry.",
      "Inspired by the way coral filters the ocean, Miller invented the Cora Ball, a laundry ball that can be tossed into the washer to cut down on clothes banging into each other. It also catches microfibers. (A portion of the proceeds goes to the Rozalia Project.) Another option is to put synthetic fabrics in a washing bag that captures fibers.",
      "Which clothes shed the most? To find out, press a strip of clear packing tape to a garment, then stick it to white paper to check for fibers, Miller said. Garments that are loosely knit or woven tend to shed more, such as fleece.",
      "Miller said people don't need to rush to throw out clothing that's more likely to shed. She owns fleece jackets herself. Instead, she suggested such clothing can be worn indoors only or outside with a layer on top, and it's worth thinking twice about acquiring more garments like that.",
      "\u201cI try not to guilt or panic people because a lot of this information is very new,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd so we might as well just say, \u2018OK, I got it. How can I be strategic about what I\u2019ve got?\u2019\u201d",
      "Filters can be added to washers to capture microfibers. Samsung Electronics collaborated with Patagonia and the global conservation organization Ocean Wise to launch one in 2023. It's now sold in more than 20 countries for front-load washers. Bosch recently launched a microfiber filter in Europe for washers.",
      "France was first to adopt a law to mandate that new washing machines sold in the country have a microfiber filter, though implementation has been delayed.",
      "In the U.S., efforts to mandate filters in states have failed. California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill in 2023, saying he was concerned about the cost to consumers and he wants to incentivize, not mandate, technologies to remove microfibers in wastewater. In Oregon, state Sen. Deb Patterson proposed a bill this year requiring microfiber filters on new washers sold in that state after she came across the technology in Canada. Patterson said the bill doesn't have enough support yet but she'll keep trying.",
      "The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers opposes the proposals, saying it's concerned about consumer costs and filter effectiveness.",
      "Some big brands are testing their fabrics to help researchers understand fiber fragmentation, including Adidas, Nike, Patagonia and Under Armour.",
      "They're among more than 90 brands, retailers and manufacturers to partner with The Microfibre Consortium in the United Kingdom, founded in 2018 to do research and offer solutions to transform textile production \u2014 including reducing fiber breakup.",
      "Nearly 1,500 fabrics have been tested. None are the same, making it a tough problem to solve, consortium CEO Kelly Sheridan said.",
      "Patagonia has been a leader in trying to stop the spread of synthetic fiber waste into air and water, saying it's up to garment brands to prevent it at the source since cleaning up microplastics in the environment is not yet possible.",
      "It paid for its own research starting a decade ago on the implication of its clothes. The company worked with suppliers to choose fabrics and dyes and to finish their clothing in ways that reduce shedding. They collaborated on new filtration technologies for washers, textile mills and municipal systems.",
      "One of their best-known styles is something called the \u201cbetter sweater\" that shifts from virgin polyester to recycled polyester to cut shedding by about 40%, said Matt Dwyer, vice president of global product footprint. And at textile mills, there's a prewash at the factory that can capture that first big shed, he added.",
      "Dwyer is optimistic about progress.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of smart people, not just understanding the problem and the scope of the problem, but also looking for solutions all the way through the manufacturing cycle and use phase,\u201d he said. \u201cCompared to 10 years ago, it\u2019s a whole new world.\u201d",

      "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell believes owners will come to a consensus in May on whether rule changes will be needed to eliminate the tush push play that\u2019s helped the Philadelphia Eagles win one Super Bowl and reach another.",
      "A proposal by the Green Bay Packers to eliminate the play was tabled at the league meetings this month but will be brought back up for a vote when the owners meet again in May.",
      "Some proponents of eliminating the play point to player safety even though there's no evidence of an increased injury risk, as well as the fact that the NFL prohibited pushing a ball carrier until a rule change that was put in place in 2005.",
      "The original proposal by the Packers would have only banned pushing a player who was lined up directly behind the snapper and receives the snap, immediately at the snap. There also has been discussion about banning pushing a ball carrier at any spot on the field.",
      "\u201cA lot of coaches would tell you that\u2019s not part of football, right. It may be rugby but it\u2019s not us,\u201d Goodell said Friday on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d at the NFL draft in Green Bay, Wisconsin.",
      "\u201cThe second thing is really the safety of the game. And that\u2019s of primary importance to us. Is it a play that\u2019s unsafe when you\u2019re in those positions where you\u2019re getting pushed or pulled and you can\u2019t control where you\u2019re going. Those are the two factors. On the other side, there\u2019s a legitimate argument that everyone can do it, and you know, if somebody does it better than the others, that\u2019s the way the game is played.\u201d",
      "It takes 24 of 32 votes to approve rule changes and neither side of the argument had clear support at the league meetings earlier this month.",
      "\u201cThere were different concepts that were discussed. I would say there was a split,\" Goodell said on McAfee's show. \"There wasn\u2019t an overwhelming push either way, but I think as people see the different things the committee has been considering and hear the conversation, I think that they\u2019ll actually develop a consensus.\u201d",
      "Goodell touched on several other topics in the interview:",
      "Goodell touched on another potential rule change that was tabled until May, saying he believes there could be a modification to the proposal from Detroit to seed the playoffs by record instead of guaranteeing the division winners a top-four seed and at least one home game. The Lions made the proposal after Minnesota was forced to go on the road as a wild-card despite winning four more games than the Rams last season.",
      "Goodell said he believes the owners could approve a smaller move to deny division winners a home game if they finish with a losing record.",
      "\u201cThe question is at some point, if you\u2019re not .500 or better, do you deserve the ability to have a home game, too?\" he asked. \"I think that\u2019s pretty hard to argue.\u201d",
      "There have been four division winners in a non-strike shortened season who hosted a playoff game despite having a losing record, with Tampa Bay the last to do it in 2022.",
      "Goodell remains committed to adding an 18th regular-season game to the schedule in the future. The NFL went from 16 games to 17 in 2021, reducing the preseason to three games, and would like to get to a model of 18 regular-season and two preseason games.",
      "Goodell said he believes changes in equipment, practice rules and the offseason program have improved safety enough to add another week of games and the revenue that comes with it. But the league needs approval from the NFLPA to do it.",
      "\u201cThey have a right to approve it,\u201d he said. \"So that\u2019s going to be really important for us, in having that conversation, say yes, we can grow the pie and they get a percentage of it. Is it the right step? I think we feel strongly that it is, but that may be something that will have to happen over a longer term. It may not be a shorter-term thing.\u201d",
      "The NFL will be playing games in Ireland and Spain for the first time this season and are set for the first game in Australia in 2026, expanding the number of countries to host a regular-season game to eight outside the United States. Goodell said the long-term plan is to get to 16 international games a year, up from seven scheduled for this season.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ll get to Asia pretty soon,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we can be worldwide with our game.\u201d",
      "Goodell said he was pleased with the league's two Christmas games on Netflix last season and said the NFL will be a staple on the holiday going forward. There will be three games on Christmas this year, when it falls on a Thursday, and he said the league plans to play at least three Christmas games every year going forward.",
      "He also said there will be a small tweak to the Thanksgiving schedule with the Detroit Lions' annual home game moving from 12:30 p.m. ET to 1 p.m. ET.",

      "Oklahoma City has a chance to secure its spot in Round 2",
      "Oklahoma City has a chance to secure its spot in Round 2. Cleveland and the Los Angeles Clippers can get to the doorstep of the second round. And the Houston-Golden State winner is going to have control of their matchup.",
      "Those are the headlines going into a quadruple-header of NBA playoff games on Saturday: Oklahoma City can sweep its series with a win at Memphis, Cleveland can take a 3-0 lead over Miami, the Clippers will aim for a 3-1 edge when it plays host to Memphis and the nightcap is a Rockets-Warriors matchup in San Francisco with those teams tied at a game apiece.",
      "And there are some injury worries, particularly for Memphis and Golden State. Grizzlies guard Ja Morant took a bad fall that knocked him out of Game 3 against Oklahoma City with a bruised hip \u2014 and helped contribute to the Thunder rallying from a 29-point deficit \u2014 while Warriors forward Jimmy Butler also is dealing with the aftereffects of a fall that knocked him out of Game 2 in Houston.",
      "\u201cI never want to see anybody get hurt. I hope he's OK,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said of Morant. \u201cYou want everybody to be at full strength. He's a great competitor. He was playing great. Obviously, that had something to do with the game as well. It'd be wrong of me not to acknowledge that.\u201d",
      "The Thunder, since relocating to Oklahoma City, were 0-95 in games where they trailed by at least 27 points \u2014 until Thursday.",
      "\u201cNever surprised. Always impressed,\" Daigneault said. \"They just feel an unbelievable responsibility to one another.\u201d",
      "When/Where to Watch: Game 3, 1 p.m. EDT (TNT)",
      "Series: Cavaliers lead, 2-0.",
      "BetMGM Sportsbook: Cavaliers by 6.5.",
      "What to Know: Miami did a lot of things right in Game 2 \u2014 teams in playoff games were 76-0 all-time when scoring at least 112 points, making 16 3s, shooting 50% or better from the field and holding their opponent to under 50% shooting. The Heat did all that and lost Game 2 anyway, simply because of Cleveland\u2019s barrage of 3-pointers and Donovan Mitchell\u2019s ability to make huge plays down the stretch to fend off a Miami run. The Heat say Game 3 is a must-win, so expect a big push to open the game. It\u2019ll be a good test for Cleveland, which was great on the road all year, to see how it handles a playoff road atmosphere.",
      "When/Where to Watch: Game 4, 3:30 p.m. EDT (TNT)",
      "Series: Thunder lead, 3-0.",
      "BetMGM Sportsbook: Thunder by 14.5.",
      "What to Know: Oklahoma City will have a chance to be the first team to reach Round 2 of the playoffs, plus can finish off a first-round sweep for the second consecutive year after ousting New Orleans 4-0 last season. The 14.5-point spread, assuming it doesn't move before game time, would be the largest according to BetMGM Sportsbook for any road team in a playoff game over the last decade. (Excluding bubble games, the biggest road favorites in the postseason since 2012 were San Antonio at Memphis in 2016 and Milwaukee at Detroit in 2019. Both were 12.5-point favorites and both covered). The challenge for Memphis will be how to fight back after losing a 29-point lead in Game 3.",
      "When/Where to Watch: Game 4, 6 p.m. EDT (TNT)",
      "Series: Clippers lead, 2-1.",
      "BetMGM Sportsbook: Clippers by 5.5.",
      "What to Know: The Clippers trailed 26-19 after 9 minutes of Game 1 \u2014 and outscored the Nuggets 98-57 the rest of the way. Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray had 37 of those final 57 points for Denver while their teammates combined to shoot 7-for-37 and score only 20 points in those 39 minutes. That is all an obvious credit to the Clippers' defense, which has been an overlooked story all season. Another boost for the Clippers out of that game was how Kawhi Leonard didn't have to log big minutes; he played only 34. Denver has to get some shooting going in Game 4, after getting outscored 54-21 on 3-pointers in Game 3.",
      "When/Where to Watch: Game 3, 8:30 p.m. EDT (ABC)",
      "Series: Tied, 1-1.",
      "BetMGM Sportsbook: Warriors by 2.5.",
      "What to Know: Golden State forward Jimmy Butler's injury status is the big question going into Game 3. And if he plays, can he be effective? The Warriors still have the upper hand in the series after getting a split of Games 1 and 2 in Houston and now come home to Chase Center \u2014 where they are 16-4 in playoff and play-in games. The Rockets are only 2-8 in that building, the third-worst record among Western Conference teams, ahead of only Utah (2-9) and Portland (1-9). Houston has to love what it has done defensively so far in the series, holding the Warriors to 95 and 94 points in the first two matches. That's a clear trend, with the Warriors being held under 100 points in five of their last six games against the Rockets. The combined numbers from those games: Rockets 582, Warriors 579, and each team going 3-3.",

      "People have started to accept, he says, that there is no more Roger Federer, no more Rafael Nadal and \u2014 soon \u2014 no more Djokovic.",
      "\u201cYou can feel there\u2019s a shift,\u201d the 37-year-old said ahead of his opening match at this year's Madrid Open, where he will try to win a milestone 100th tour-level title.",

      "Djokovic said he has been trying his best to \u201crepresent the older guys, the older generation,\u201d and bring a \u201cpositive effect to the tournaments and to the tour itself.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s also one of the reasons why I keep on playing,\" he said. \"Because I feel like it also helps tennis still thrive on the attention and crowd coming in, and watching tournaments and getting interested.\u201d",
      "Djokovic noted the \u201crecord-breaking\u201d numbers in attendance at the Grand Slams and some ATP 1000 tournaments like Indian Wells.",
      "\u201c(It\u2019s) good news that it shouldn\u2019t be dependent on the big stars or legends of the game that retired,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sport should outlive everyone, the sport will outlive everyone, and the sport is more important than anybody individually. So we are all here in the service of a sport as well.",
      "\u201cThis is something to keep in mind, that when you play and all the things that you\u2019re doing outside of the court as a top player, you are trying to contribute to the popularity of the tennis, to bring more people, bring young children and people to tennis, and get interested and excited about tennis. I see (it) happening, but we still have big steps to make in that regard.\u201d",
      "Djokovic noted that he was older than some of the current youngsters \u2014 such as Spanish star Carlos Alcaraz, 21, \u2014 when he began dominating on tour.",
      "\u201cBetween, let\u2019s say, 23 and 33 is when it was really happening. And now Carlos is still not 23,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cWe have to remember that his age and what he has done for his age is not also normal. I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ll see a lot of him on the big stage with trophies in the future in, whatever, 10 years, 15 years, as long as he\u2019s playing.\u201d",
      "Alcaraz withdrew from his home tournament because of muscle injuries. He had been in the same half of the draw as Djokovic.",
      "Djokovic, a three-time champion in Madrid, hasn\u2019t played in the Spanish capital since losing to Alcaraz in the 2022 semifinals. He is set to play Italy\u2019s Matteo Arnaldi on Saturday.",
      "Djokovic is seeking his first title of the season after losing in his opening matches both in Monte Carlo and Indian Wells. He reached the final in Miami, losing in straight sets to Jakub Mensik.",
      "Djokovic won his 99th title last August at the Paris Olympics. He has lost four finals since then. The only two players to reach the 100-title milestone were Jimmy Connors (109) and Federer (103).",

      "Not all 38 selections from this year\u2019s draft will have such assurances. The WNBA has potentially 156 coveted roster spots among 13 teams, and other options for pro careers in women\u2019s basketball either in the U.S. or overseas are scarce. Teams can have up to 12 players on their rosters if they fit under the league's salary cap, but most franchises carry only 11.",

      "There\u2019s a simple reason why being among those 38 draft picks doesn\u2019t ensure a roster spot: Most of the spots will be taken by returning players.",
      "Last year\u2019s draft class headlined by Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese had 13 players make opening day rosters, which was down two from the previous season and four from 2022. Many teams draft international players to stash them overseas until potentially having them join the franchise at a future date.",
      "Players have tried to carve out a WNBA chance by playing professionally overseas, but those jobs also are at a premium. Brittney Griner\u2019s nine-month incarceration in Moscow along with the war in Ukraine have led to the elimination of dozens of potential jobs in Russia.",

      "It will be a lot harder for second- and third-round picks to remain in the WNBA after training camp.",
      "Of course, it\u2019s disappointing for players who come so close to fulfilling their WNBA dreams but get squeezed out because of numbers. However, it also can be a big deal for fans who no longer get to see a favorite college player on the court.",
      "The league is adding two more expansion teams in 2026, with Portland and Toronto being awarded franchises. That will open up potentially two dozen more jobs.",

      "Interest in the Negro Leagues has spiked of late in large part because of its inclusion in MLB The Show and when records for more than 2,300 players were incorporated into Major League Baseball statistics. The museum that was founded in a tiny, one-room office space in 1990 that attracts about 70,000 visitors each year \u2014 plus major leaguers who stop by during road trips \u2014 has outgrown its space at 18th and Vine.",

That might be a little bit ambitious, but it\u2019s doable.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep the story going, keep it alive,\u201d Howard said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand the history of Black baseball and how it correlates with baseball, in general, and Major League Baseball.\u201d",

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Pope Francis' beloved soccer club in his native Buenos Aires, San Lorenzo, celebrated a Mass late Wednesday dedicated to its most famous fan two days after his death, with Argentina still awash in emotional tributes to the first Latin American pontiff.",
      "Dozens of San Lorenzo club members sporting club jerseys and clutching rosaries gathered to bid farewell to Pope Francis at the team chapel in the Argentine capital\u2019s middle-class Almagro district \u2014 the same wood-roofed church where another Catholic priest founded the club over a century ago and where Jorge Mario Bergoglio said Mass years before becoming Pope Francis.",
      "Bergoglio attended San Lorenzo matches as a child with his Italian immigrant father and remained an unabashed fan throughout his life, paying monthly club membership fees until his death Monday at the age of 88. Bergoglio grew up in the Flores neighborhood, not far from the San Lorenzo stadium.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not saying goodbye to a fan or the club\u2019s most important fan. Today, many of us are saying goodbye to a friend,\u201d said Father Juan Pablo Sclippa, who presided over the memorial Mass Wednesday from an altar festooned with portraits of the pope. \u201cFrancisco was truly great, the best player on the field, the best player in the world, who never believed in himself.\u201d",
      "The San Lorenzo club \u2014 founded by Father Lorenzo Massa in 1908 as part of an effort to get children off the crime-ridden streets \u2014 became central to Bergoglio\u2019s image as the \u201cPope of the people.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I read the story of San Lorenzo, everything came together for me,\u201d said Pablo Avalos, 52, a fan at the Mass who credits Francis with inspiring his love of the club. \u201cSan Lorenzo has a lot to do with Francis. It started with Massa\u2019s social action that rescued children from the streets.\u201d",
      "Both as a charismatic cleric in his hometown and the influential leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Rome, Francis was admired for his humility, simplicity and informality.",
      "In Buenos Aires, he commuted by bus, walked barefoot through the city's sprawling shantytowns and exchanged soccer banter with parishioners. At the Vatican, he shunned fancy velvet for a plain white cassock, caught people off-guard with wisecracks and expressed solidarity with the world\u2019s downtrodden.",
      "Despite his far-flung travels and frantic schedule, Francis remained attached to San Lorenzo \u2014 keeping informed of the club's ups and downs largely through the radio ever since vowing never to watch TV again in 1990.",
      "Those searching for miracles to support Francis' sainthood point to the team's meteoric rise through the ranks shortly after Francis became pope in 2013. Months later the club became Argentine champions and, in 2014, won its first Copa Libertadores \u2014 South America\u2019s equivalent of the Champions League.",

      "The surprise transfers of brothers Nico and Madden Iamaleava have prompted fresh questions about contracts and name, image and likeness buyouts for athletes in a college sports landscape looking increasingly like the pros",
      "FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- The surprise transfers of brothers Nico and Madden Iamaleava have prompted fresh questions about contracts and name, image and likeness buyouts for athletes in a college sports landscape looking increasingly like the pros.",
      "Nico Iamaleava, who led Tennessee to the College Football Playoff last season, walked away from a reported $2.4 million NIL contract to seek higher pay elsewhere. He joined UCLA on Sunday, reportedly for half the money though terms of any NIL deal were not released.",
      "Arkansas freshman quarterback Madden Iamaleava entered the portal this week not long after spring practices wrapped up and will join his brother at UCLA, according to multiple media reports.",
      "Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek released a statement indicating he would support efforts by the Razorbacks' NIL collective to enforce buyout clauses in athlete contracts. Iamaleava reportedly had a contract valued at $500,000 upon signing with Arkansas on Dec. 4, according to reports.",
      "Arkansas Edge, the school's collective, requires athletes to repay 50% of their remaining contract value if they leave before the contract expires, according to reports. The Arkansas athletic department declined to comment and Arkansas Edge did not respond to messages.",
      "Yurachek, in a post on X that did not name Iamaleava, wrote: \u201cI have spoken with the leadership team at Arkansas Edge and expressed my support in their pursuit to enforce their rights under any agreement violated by our student-athletes moving forward. We appreciate Edge's investment in our student-athletes and acknowledge the enforcement of these agreements is vital in our new world of college athletics.\u201d",
      "The latest cycle of transfers has seen a lot of chaos and accusations of tampering. Earlier this year, Wisconsin said it had \u201ccredible information\u201d that Miami and Xavier Lucas made impermissible contact with each other before the former Badgers cornerback decided to transfer to his home-state school.",
      "All this comes with final approval of the $2.8 billion NCAA antitrust settlement looming. The plan will clear the way for Division I schools to share up to $20.5 million each with their athletes annually but also assess NIL deals athletes sign with third parties.",
      "The settlement would go into effect July 1, and athletes have been scrambling to renegotiate contracts or find better opportunities at new schools before deals valued at $600 or more must be approved through a clearinghouse that will be administered in part by financial giant Deloitte in a bid to establish fair market value.",
      "Rich Stankewicz, the director of operations for the Happy Valley United collective backing Penn State athletics, said he thinks there is a time and place for NIL buyouts, citing a spring transfer departing before playing a snap as an example. He favors incentive-based contracts contingent on in-season academic and athletic performance.",
      "\u201cIf more money is paid out in those time frames, that gives incentive for the player to stay and see those dollars from their contract, rather than potentially collecting up front and then deciding the grass is greener somewhere else three months later,\u201d he told the Associated Press.",
      "Iamaleava, who is from Long Beach, California, initially pledged to UCLA last May. He made a signing-day flip from the Bruins to Arkansas and enrolled in January. He was the No. 3 quarterback in spring practice behind Taylen Green and KJ Jackson.",
      "Some of the questions amid all the transferring and severed deals center on whether NIL deals are enforceable contracts with the NCAA settlement not yet approved.",
      "Matthew Shepherd, an attorney and member of the Arkansas House of Representatives, co-sponsored the state's NIL law. He said if Madden Iamaleava left on his own volition, the terms of the NIL deal would be subject to standard contract law.",
      "Shepherd noted the NIL law was modified in 2023 to include a provision prohibiting a third party from offering NIL inducements to an athlete who already is enrolled at one of the state's schools or who has entered into an enrollment contract. If that happened in Iamaleava's case, Shepherd said, the school or third party such as an NIL collective could take legal action against the violating party.",

      "Along with proclamations from the mayor, there were also the cowboy hats for each of the Wings draftees: Bueckers, 12th overall pick Aziaha James from North Carolina State, 14th pick Madison Scott from Mississippi, 27th pick JJ Quinerly from West Virginia and 31st pick Aaronette Vonleh from Baylor.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s talked about just being a part of a new family, being a part of a new city. Dallas is a great sports city, you can feel the love and support already,\u201d Bueckers said. \"There's lot of new in this organization, so be a part of something and build with each other, and just create a new sisterhood.\u201d",
      "The introductory news conference was held a couple of blocks from the historic downtown arena being fully renovated to become the new home of the Wings next season.",
      "But Bueckers\u2019 home games in her first season with the Wings will be about 20 miles away at College Park Center at UT-Arlington, where they will play their 10th and final season since the franchise relocated from Tulsa, Oklahoma.",
      "Except for one home game on June 27. The Wings that night will play Indiana and Caitlin Clark, last year\u2019s No. 1 overall pick, at the home of the NBA\u2019s Dallas Mavericks.",
      "It was a year ago Thursday that the Dallas City Council approved a 15-year agreement worth $19 million to facilitate the team\u2019s pending move to its namesake city. The council also approved a $7.7 million renovation to the arena that was once home to the Dallas Chaparrals of the American Basketball Association, who moved to San Antonio to become the Spurs in 1973, and joined the NBA when the ABA folded three years later.",
      "\u201cWe stood right here in this building, and we proudly announced that the Dallas Wings would soon be making downtown Dallas their permanent home,\u201d Mayor Eric Johnson said Wednesday. \u201cAnd since then, the excitement has only grown, the fan base has rallied and today we\u2019re taking the next big step forward.

To make matters worse, its digital ad network also was found to be illegally abusing its power earlier this month in another case brought by the Justice Department.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war has injected more uncertainty into the mix by rattling the financial markets amid fears the tariffs will reignite inflation while dragging the economy into a recession. Although Google\u2019s digital services aren\u2019t directly impacted by the tariffs, a recession would likely curtail the spending on ads that generate most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue.",
      "But there were few signs of a slowdown in the past quarter. Google's ad revenue during the period totaled $72.5 billion, an 11% increase from the same time a year ago.",
      "The steady growth emboldened Alphabet to stand firm on plans to invest $75 billion on AI and other technologies this year while also pursuing approval of a $32 billion deal to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz.",

      "The Shenzhou 20 mission is scheduled to blast off Thursday evening from a launch center in Jiuquan, on the edge of the Gobi Desert in northwestern China.",
      "The Tiangong, or \u201cHeavenly Palace,\u201d space station has made China a major contender in space, especially since it was entirely Chinese-built after the country was excluded from the International Space Station over U.S. national security concerns. China's space program is controlled by the People\u2019s Liberation Army, the military branch of the ruling Communist Party.",

      "Since first launching a man into space in 2003 \u2014 becoming only the third country to do so \u2014 China's space program has advanced at a steady pace.

      "While in space, the astronauts will conduct experiments in medical science and new technologies and perform space walks to carry out maintenance and install new equipment, the Manned Space Agency said.",

      "SHANGHAI -- The world\u2019s auto industry is getting a shake-up from Chinese automakers that are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles designed to wow car buyers with sleek designs and the latest high-tech interiors.",
      "Companies like BYD, Great Wall, Geely and Chery Automobile are reaching outward as they build the scale they need to survive cut-throat competition in their home market.",
      "These generally are not state-run giants like SAIC, BAIC and Guangzhou Automotive. The founder of Geely started out making refrigerators.",
      "BYD first built up its expertise in battery technology, now its biggest advantage as the world\u2019s largest-selling EV maker. Some others are technology companies allied with automakers to offer autonomous driving.",
      "Here are some of the key players:",
      "Great Wall Motors, with the Haval, Wey, Ora, Poer and Tank brands, is banking on overseas sales to keep growing after seeing its sales inside China fall by nearly 15% last year, even as the company\u2019s net profit jumped more than 80%. The company has factories in Russia, Thailand and Brazil, where it is challenging Toyota\u2019s popular Hilux pickup truck with its GWM Poer, a hybrid pickup of its own. Another mainstay is the Haval H6, a hybrid sports SUV.",
      "Great Wall has smoothed its transition to overseas production by buying factories of other automakers. In Thailand, it took over a factory formerly operated by General Motors Corp. In Brazil, it purchased a former Mercedes-Benz plant.",
      "\u201cIt is essential for volume to be big, otherwise the cost of production is too high,\u201d Great Wall\u2019s chairman, Wei Jianjun, said in a media huddle at the show. Wei, who also goes by the name Jack Wey, was born in Beijing but moved to nearby Hebei, home of the Great Wall. He led the company\u2019s transition from vehicle modification to automaking, becoming China\u2019s biggest maker of pickup trucks and a leading SUV maker. The company has a joint venture for EVs with BMW.",
      "State-owned Chery Automobile says it was the first Chinese automaker to export overseas. It has sold more than 15 million of its Chery, Exeed, Omoda and Jetour models overseas, mostly in the developing world and emerging markets, including Turkey and Ukraine. Chery reported selling 2.6 million vehicles overseas last year and is aiming for 3 million in 2025. It\u2019s quickly expanding overseas production, setting up factories in Russia and Spain. It is expanding rapidly in Latin America.",
      "Chery\u2019s tie-up with EV-maker Visionary Vehicles aimed to sell in North America but has not yet achieved that goal. The company has a 50-50 joint venture with Jaguar Land Rover, which is a subsidiary of Tata Motors of India that makes Jaguars and Land Rovers in China. It also collaborates with Huawei Technologies and e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "Chery still sells far more fuel-engine cars than EVs. Its battery electric vehicle company, Chery New Energy, makes minivehicles like the eQ1, or Small Ant, and the QQ Ice Cream. Its mainstays are the Tiggo lineup of SUVs and its Arrizo sedans.",
      "BYD made more electric vehicles last year than Tesla, selling 3.52 million EVs in China, up 28% from a year earlier. Its strength in plug-in hybrids has helped as Chinese increasingly opt for the fallback of a fuel engine.",
      "The company, based in southern China's Shenzhen, recently announced an ultra-fast EV charging system it says can provide a full charge for its latest EVs within five to eight minutes, about as long as a fill-up. It plans to build more than 4,000 of the new charging stations across China.",
      "The Chinese company started out making batteries and has been refining its battery and energy storage technology while building an auto empire that is expanding outside China.",
      "While BYD\u2019s fanciest, latest premium models are expected to sell for up to about $40,000, it also makes much less expensive EVs including the Seagull, which sells for around $12,000 in China.",
      "BYD barely nudged ahead of Tesla in production of battery-powered EVs in 2024, making 1,777,965 compared with Tesla\u2019s 1,773,443.",
      "Geely Auto is perhaps the most famous Chinese automaker that many people have never heard of. The privately held company was founded as a refrigerator-maker by businessman Li Shufu in 1997 in eastern China\u2019s Taizhou, which early on became a hub of private industry.",
      "Li began making strategic overseas acquisitions early on, buying Sweden\u2019s Volvo Car Co. from Ford Motor in 2010. Geely's purchase of a 49.9% stake in Malaysia\u2019s Proton gave it a 51% stake in luxury sports car brand Lotus. It formed a 50-50 joint venture to make Smart city cars with Germany\u2019s Daimler AG. It also works with Renault SA of France on powertrains and owns a stake in Aston Martin Lagonda.",
      "In March, it launched sales of its Geely EX5 SUVs in Australia and New Zealand, adding to its global reach.",
      "Geely also owns New York Stock Exchange-listed Zeekr Intelligent Technology Holding, which makes a premium EV brand. Geely and Volvo own Swedish automaker Polestar, which has struggled in the U.S. market.",
      "China\u2019s second-best selling EV brand is Wuling, a joint venture of Shanghai\u2019s SAIC Motor, General Motors and Guangxi Auto. It sold more than 673,000 EVs in China and has a market share of only 6% compared with BYD\u2019s nearly one-third share. Tesla came in third at 659,000 cars sold.",
      "Apart from its Baojun sedans and vans, Wuling mainly makes engines, commercial vehicles and special purpose vehicles like mini-EVs and golf carts.",
      "Other major Chinese brands of EVs include Nio, Xpeng, Li Auto and Leap Motor. State-run giants like Dongfeng Motor Group, which has an alliance with Nissan Motor Corp., and Changan Automobile, a partner with Japan\u2019s Mazda Motor Corp. and with Ford Motor Co., are also quickly expanding EV sales.",
      "But the industry is fast-changing and competition in the home market is tough. That\u2019s a key reason why the biggest automakers have focused attention on expanding into global markets.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has ordered sharper scrutiny of America\u2019s colleges and the accreditors that oversee them",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has ordered sharper scrutiny of America\u2019s colleges and the accreditors that oversee them, part of his escalating campaign to end what he calls \" wokeness \u201d and diversity efforts in education.",
      "In a series of executive actions signed Wednesday, Trump targeted universities that he views as liberal adversaries to his political agenda. One order called for harder enforcement of a federal law requiring colleges to disclose their financial ties with foreign sources, while another called for a shakeup of the accrediting bodies that decide whether colleges can accept federal financial aid awarded to students.",
      "Trump also ordered the Education Department to root out efforts to ensure equity in discipline in the nation's K-12 schools. Previous guidance from Democratic administrations directed schools not to disproportionately punish underrepresented minorities such as Black and Native American students. The administration says equity efforts amount to racial discrimination.",
      "Colleges\u2019 financial ties with foreign sources have long been a concern among Republicans, especially ties with China and other countries with adversarial relationships with the U.S. It became a priority during Trump\u2019s first term and reemerged last week as the White House grasped for leverage in its escalating battle with Harvard University.",
      "The White House said it needed to take action because Harvard and other colleges have routinely violated a federal disclosure law, which has been unevenly enforced since it was passed in the 1980s. Known as Section 117 of the Higher Education Act, the law requires colleges to disclose foreign gifts and contracts valued at $250,000 or more.",
      "Last week, the Education Department demanded records from Harvard over foreign financial ties spanning the past decade, accusing the school of filing \u201cincomplete and inaccurate disclosures.\u201d Trump's administration is sparring with Harvard over the university's refusal to accept a list of demands over its handling of pro-Palestinian protests as well as its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "In the executive order, Trump calls on the Education Department and the attorney general to step up enforcement of the law and take action against colleges that violate it, including a cutoff of federal money.",
      "The Trump administration intends to \u201cend the secrecy surrounding foreign funds in American educational institutions\u201d and protect against \u201cforeign exploitation,\u201d the order said.",
      "It was applauded by Republicans, including Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. He accused China of exploiting academic ties to steal research and \u201cindoctrinate students.\u201d",
      "Another order aims at accrediting bodies that set standards colleges must meet to accept federal financial aid from students. Trump campaigned on a promise to overhaul the industry, saying it was \u201cdominated by Marxist Maniacs and lunatics.\u201d",
      "Often overlooked as an obscure branch of college oversight, accreditors play an important role in shaping colleges in many aspects, with standards that apply all the way from colleges\u2019 governing boards to classroom curriculum.",
      "Trump's executive order is the opening salvo in what could be a lengthy battle to overhaul the accrediting industry. Chief among his priorities is to strip accreditors of DEI requirements imposed on colleges. Some accreditors have already dropped or stopped enforcing such standards amid Trump\u2019s DEI crackdown.",
      "Trump\u2019s order calls on the government to suspend or terminate accreditors that discriminate in the name of DEI. Instead, it calls on accreditors to focus more squarely on the student outcomes of colleges and programs they oversee.",
      "The president wants to make it easier for new accreditors to compete with the 19 that are now authorized to work on behalf of the federal government. As it stands, new accreditors looking to be recognized by the government must undergo an arduous process that traditionally takes years. Trump\u2019s order said it should be \u201ctransparent, efficient, and not unduly burdensome.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead of pushing schools to adopt a divisive DEI ideology, accreditors should be focused on helping schools improve graduation rates and graduates\u2019 performance in the labor market,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.",
      "Trump also invoked opposition to equity efforts in his order on school discipline. The edict signed Wednesday seeks a return to \u201ccommon sense school discipline,\u201d allowing decisions to be based solely on students\u2019 behavior and actions, McMahon said.",
      "Another executive order instructs government agencies and departments to no longer rely on \u201cdisparate impact theories.\u201d Under the disparate impact standard, policies and practices that disproportionately impact minorities and other protected groups could be challenged regardless of their intent.",
      "In many schools around the country, Black students have been more likely to receive punishments that remove them from the classroom, including suspensions, expulsions and being transferred to alternative schools. A decade ago, those differences became the target of a reform movement spurred by the same reckoning that gave rise to Black Lives Matter. The movement elevated the concept of the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline\u201d \u2014 the notion that being kicked out of school, or dropping out, increases the chance of arrest and imprisonment years later.",
      "Federal guidelines to address racial disparities in school discipline first came from President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in 2014. Federal officials urged schools not to suspend, expel or refer students to law enforcement except as a last resort, and encouraged restorative justice practices that did not push students out of the classroom. Those rules were rolled back by Trump\u2019s first administration, but civil rights regulations at federal and state levels still mandate the collection of data on discipline.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump directed McMahon to issue new school discipline guidance within 60 days. The order also calls for a review of nonprofit organizations that have promoted discipline policies rooted in equity and ensure they don\u2019t receive federal money.",
      "Another order creates a federal task force focused on giving America\u2019s students training on artificial intelligence as early as kindergarten. It would work to develop new online learning resources.",
      "Trump is also establishing a White House initiative to empower Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Among other efforts, it would seek to promote private-sector partnerships with HBCUs and schools\u2019 workforce preparation in industries like technology and finance.",

      "Elon Musk intends to focus more on his job as Tesla CEO, but it\u2019s unclear if the billionaire will be able to solve a big problem of his own making: damage to its brand",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk has been called a Moonshot Master, the Edison of Our Age and the Architect of the Future, but he's got a big problem at his car company and it's not clear he can fix it: damage to its brand.",
      "Sales have plunged for Tesla amid protests and boycotts over Musk's embrace of far right-wing views. Profits have been sliced by two-thirds so far this year, and rivals from China, Europe and the U.S. are pouncing.",
      "On Tuesday came some relief as Musk announced in an earnings call with investors that he would be scaling back his government cost-cutting job in Washington to a \u201cday or two per week\" to focus more on his old job as Tesla's boss.",
      "Investors pushed up Tesla's stock 5% Wednesday, though there are plenty of challenges ahead.",
      "Musk seemed to downplay the role that brand damage played in the drop in first-quarter sales on the investor call. Instead, he emphasized something more fleeting \u2014 an upgrade to Tesla's best-selling Model Y that forced a shutdown of factories and pinched both supply and demand.",
      "While financial analysts following the company have noted that potential buyers probably held back while waiting for the upgrade, hurting results, even the most bullish among them say the brand damage is real, and more worrisome.",
      "\u201cThis is a full blown crisis,\u201d said Wedbush Securities' normally upbeat Dan Ives earlier this month. In a note to its clients, JP Morgan warned of \u201cunprecedented brand damage.\"",
      "Musk dismissed the protests against Tesla on the call as the work of people angry at his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency because \u201cthose who are receiving the waste and fraud wish it to continue.\u201d",
      "But the protests in Europe, thousands of miles from Washington, came after Musk supported far-right politicians there. Angry Europeans hung Musk in effigy in Milan, projected an image of him doing a straight-arm salute on a Tesla factory in Berlin and put up posters in London urging people not to buy \u201cSwasticars\u201d from him.",
      "Sales in Europe have gone into a free fall in the first three months of this year \u2014 down 39%. In Germany, sales plunged 62%.",
      "Another worrying sign: On Tuesday, Tesla backed off its earlier promise that sales would recover this year after dropping in 2024 for the first time a dozen years. Tesla said the global trade situation was too uncertain and declined to repeat the forecast.",
      "Meanwhile, Tesla's competition is stealing its customers.",
      "Among its fiercest rivals now is Chinese giant BYD. Earlier this year, the EV maker announced it had developed an electric battery that can charge within minutes. And Tesla\u2019s European rivals have begun offering new models with advanced technology that is making them real Tesla alternatives just as popular opinion has turned against Musk.",
      "Tesla's share of the EV market in the U.S. has dropped from two-thirds to less than half, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "Another rival, Google parent Alphabet, is already ahead of Tesla in an area that Musk has promised will help remake his company: Cybercabs.",
      "One of the highlights of Tesla\u2019s call Tuesday was Musk sticking with his previous prediction that it will l aunch driverless cabs without steering wheels and pedals in Austin, Texas, in June, and in other cities soon after.",
      "But Google\u2019s service, called Waymo, already has logged millions of driverless cybercab trips in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "Musk also told analysts that this driverless capability will be available on the Tesla vehicles already on the road through software updates over the air, and put a timeline on it: \u201cThere will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously in the second half of the year.\"",
      "But he has made similar promises before, only to miss his deadlines, such as in April 2019 when he vowed full automation by the end of the next year. He repeated the prediction, moving up the date, several more times, in following years.",
      "A big problem is federal investigators have not given the all-clear that Tesla vehicles can drive completely on their own safely. Among other probes, safety regulators are looking into Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving, which is only partial self-driving, for its tie to accidents in low-visibility conditions like when there is sun glare.",
      "In competition with rivals in the U.S., Tesla currently has one clear advantage: It will get hurt by less by tariffs because most of its vehicles are built in the countries where they are sold, including those in its biggest market, the U.S.",
      "\u201cTariffs are still tough on a company where margins are still low, but we do have localized supply chains,\u201d Musk said Tuesday. \u201cThat puts us in a strong position.\u201d",
      "The company also reconfirmed that a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y sport utility vehicle, will be ready for customers in the first half of this year. That could help boost sales.",
      "Another plus: The company had a blow out first quarter in its energy storage business. And Musk has promised to be producing 5,000 Optimus robots, another Tesla business, by the end of the year.",
      "Even after falling nearly 50% from its December highs, Tesla's stock is still very richly valued based on the one yardstick that really matters in the long run: its earnings.",
      "At 110 times its expected per share earnings this year, the stock is valued more than 25 times higher than General Motors. The average stock on in the S&P 500 index trades at less than 20 times earnings.",
      "That leaves Tesla little margin for error if something goes wrong.",

      "The legal licensing body said in a news release Monday that it will ask the California Supreme Court to adjust test scores for those who took its February bar exam.",
      "\u201cThe debacle that was the February 2025 bar exam is worse than we imagined,\u201d Mary Basick, assistant dean of academic skills at the University of California, Irvine, Law School, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI\u2019m almost speechless. Having the questions drafted by non-lawyers using artificial intelligence is just unbelievable.\u201d",
      "In February, the new exam led to complaints after many test-takers were unable to complete their bar exams. The online testing platforms repeatedly crashed before some applicants even started. Others struggled to finish and save essays, experienced screen lags and error messages and could not copy and paste text, the Times reported earlier.",
      "According to a recent presentation by the State Bar, 100 of the 171 scored multiple-choice questions were made by Kaplan and 48 were drawn from a first-year law students exam. A smaller subset of 23 scored questions were made by ACS Ventures, the State Bar\u2019s psychometrician, and developed with artificial intelligence.",

      "Katie Moran, an associate professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law who specializes in bar exam preparation, told the newspaper, \u201cIt\u2019s a staggering admission.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe State Bar has admitted they employed a company to have a non-lawyer use AI to draft questions that were given on the actual bar exam,\u201d she said. \u201cThey then paid that same company to assess and ultimately approve of the questions on the exam, including the questions the company authored.\u201d",

      "\u201cUltimately, I\u2019m worried about who owns and controls this technology once it\u2019s created,\u201d said Page Hedley, a former policy and ethics adviser at OpenAI, in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Backed by three Nobel Prize winners and other advocates and experts, Hedley and nine other ex-OpenAI workers sent a letter this week to the two state attorneys general.",
      "The coalition is asking California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, both Democrats, to use their authority to protect OpenAI's charitable purpose and block its planned restructuring. OpenAI is incorporated in Delaware and operates out of San Francisco.",
      "OpenAI said in response that \u201cany changes to our existing structure would be in service of ensuring the broader public can benefit from AI.\u201d It said its for-profit will be a public benefit corporation, similar to other AI labs like Anthropic and tech billionaire Elon Musk's xAI, except that OpenAI will still preserve a nonprofit arm.",
      "\u201cThis structure will continue to ensure that as the for-profit succeeds and grows, so too does the nonprofit, enabling us to achieve the mission,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "The letter is the second petition to state officials this month. The last came from a group of labor leaders and nonprofits focused on protecting OpenAI's billions of dollars of charitable assets.",
      "Jennings said last fall she would \u201creview any such transaction to ensure that the public\u2019s interests are adequately protected.\" Bonta\u2019s office sought more information from OpenAI late last year but has said it can\u2019t comment, even to confirm or deny if it is investigating.",
      "OpenAI's co-founders, including current CEO Sam Altman and Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build what's known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanity's benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.",
      "OpenAI already has a for-profit subsidiary but faces a number of challenges in converting its core governance structure. One is a lawsuit from Musk, who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led the Tesla CEO to invest in the charity.",
      "While some of the signatories of this week's letter support Musk's lawsuit, Hedley said others are \u201cunderstandably cynical\u201d because Musk also runs his own rival AI company.",
      "The signatories include two Nobel-winning economists, Oliver Hart and Joseph Stiglitz, as well as AI pioneers and computer scientists Geoffrey Hinton, who won last year's Nobel Prize in physics, and Stuart Russell.",
      "\u201cI like OpenAI\u2019s mission to \u2018ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity,\u2019 and I would like them to execute that mission instead of enriching their investors,\" Hinton said in a statement Wednesday. \"I\u2019m happy there is an effort to hold OpenAI to its mission that does not involve Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "Conflicts over OpenAI's purpose have long simmered at the San Francisco institute, contributing to Musk quitting in 2018, Altman's short-lived ouster in 2023 and other high-profile departures.",
      "Hedley, a lawyer by training, worked for OpenAI in 2017 and 2018, a time when the nonprofit was still navigating the best ways to steward the technology it wanted to build. As recently as 2023, Altman said advanced AI held promise but also warned of extraordinary risks, from drastic accidents to societal disruptions.",
      "In recent years, however, Hedley said he watched with concern as OpenAI, buoyed by the success of ChatGPT, was increasingly cutting corners on safety testing and rushing out new products to get ahead of business competitors.",
      "\u201cThe costs of those decisions will continue to go up as the technology becomes more powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that in the new structure that OpenAI wants, the incentives to rush to make those decisions will go up and there will no longer be anybody really who can tell them not to, tell them this is not OK.\u201d",
      "Software engineer Anish Tondwalkar, a former member of OpenAI\u2019s technical team until last year, said an important assurance in OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit charter is a \u201cstop-and-assist clause\u201d that directs OpenAI to stand down and help if another organization is nearing the achievement of better-than-human AI.",
      "\u201cIf OpenAI is allowed to become a for-profit, these safeguards, and OpenAI\u2019s duty to the public can vanish overnight,\u201d Tondwalkar said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Another former worker who signed the letter puts it more bluntly.",
      "\u201cOpenAI may one day build technology that could get us all killed,\" said Nisan Stiennon, an AI engineer who worked at OpenAI from 2018 to 2020. \"It is to OpenAI\u2019s credit that it\u2019s controlled by a nonprofit with a duty to humanity. This duty precludes giving up that control.\u201d",

      "Harmful bleaching of the world\u2019s coral has now grown to include 84% of the ocean\u2019s reefs in the most intense event of its kind in recorded history",
      "Harmful bleaching of the world's coral has grown to include 84% of the ocean's reefs in the most intense event of its kind in recorded history, the International Coral Reef Initiative announced Wednesday.",
      "It's the fourth global bleaching event since 1998, and has now surpassed bleaching from 2014-17 that hit some two-thirds of reefs, said the ICRI, a mix of more than 100 governments, non-governmental organizations and others. And it's not clear when the current crisis, which began in 2023 and is blamed on warming oceans, will end.",
      "\u201cWe may never see the heat stress that causes bleaching dropping below the threshold that triggers a global event,\u201d said Mark Eakin, executive secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired coral monitoring chief for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at something that\u2019s completely changing the face of our planet and the ability of our oceans to sustain lives and livelihoods,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "Last year was Earth\u2019s hottest year on record, and much of that is going into oceans. The average annual sea surface temperature of oceans away from the poles was a record 20.87 degrees Celsius (69.57 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "That's deadly to corals, which are key to seafood production, tourism and protecting coastlines from erosion and storms. Coral reefs are sometimes dubbed \u201crainforests of the sea\u201d because they support high levels of biodiversity \u2014 approximately 25% of all marine species can be found in, on and around coral reefs.",
      "Coral get their bright colors from the colorful algae that live inside them and are a food source for the corals. Prolonged warmth causes the algae to release toxic compounds, and the coral eject them. A stark white skeleton is left behind, and the weakened coral is at heightened risk of dying.",
      "The bleaching event has been so severe that NOAA\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program has had to add levels to its bleaching alert scale to account for the growing risk of coral death.",
      "Efforts are underway to conserve and restore coral. One Dutch lab has worked with coral fragments, including some taken from off the coast of the Seychelles, to propagate them in a zoo so that they might be used someday to repopulate wild coral reefs if needed. Other projects, including one off Florida, have worked to rescue corals endangered by high heat and nurse them back to health before returning them to the ocean.",
      "But scientists say it's essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet, such as carbon dioxide and methane.",
      "\u201cThe best way to protect coral reefs is to address the root cause of climate change. And that means reducing the human emissions that are mostly from burning of fossil fuels \u2026 everything else is looking more like a Band-Aid rather than a solution,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "\u201cI think people really need to recognize what they\u2019re doing \u2026 inaction is the kiss of death for coral reefs,\u201d said Melanie McField, co-chair of the Caribbean Steering Committee for the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, a network of scientists that monitors reefs throughout the world.",
      "The group's update comes as President Donald Trump has moved aggressively in his second term to boost fossil fuels and roll back clean energy programs, which he says is necessary for economic growth.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a government right now that is working very hard to destroy all of these ecosystems ... removing these protections is going to have devastating consequences,\" Eakin said.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry's bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn't anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House nearly 100 days ago.",
      "Since President Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, Big Tech stocks have been on a see-sawing ride that has eviscerated trillions of dollars in shareholder wealth amid an onslaught of tariffs and other potentially detrimental actions.",

      "That display of unity reflected a belief that Trump's second stint in the White House would be a refreshing change from the heavy-handed regulation of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration while unleashing even more lucrative opportunities in artificial intelligence and deal-making.",

Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value has plunged by $3.8 trillion, or 22%, as of April 20.",
      "The financial damage was even more severe a few days after Trump\u2019s April 2 unveiling of sweeping reciprocal tariffs that would have exacted a heavy toll on Big Tech's supply chains in China and other key markets around the globe. A temporary freeze on the majority of the most punitive tariffs and an exemption from most of the fees on electronics coming in from China has provided some relief, but Trump has made it clear the reprieve may be short-lived.",
      "That has left the specter of Trump's ongoing trade war hanging over Big Tech, whose influence extends around the world.",

Trump also has given no indication of abandoning antitrust lawsuits filed by the Biden administration that could hobble Apple and Amazon.",

      "The drama will unfold in a Washington courtroom during the next three weeks during hearings that will determine how the company should be penalized for operating an illegal monopoly in search. The proceedings, known in legal parlance as a \u201cremedy hearing,\u201d feature a parade of witnesses that includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is asking a federal judge to order a radical shake-up that would ban Google from striking the multibillion dollar deals with Apple and other tech companies that shield its search engine from competition, share its repository of valuable user data with rivals and force a sale of its popular Chrome browser.",
      "The moment of reckoning comes four-and-half-years after the Justice Department filed a landmark lawsuit alleging Google\u2019s search engine had been abusing its power as the internet's main gateway to stifle competition and innovation for more than a decade.",
      "After the case finally went to trial in 2023, a federal judge last year ruled Google had been making anti-competitive deals to lock in its search engine as the go-to place for digital information on the iPhone, personal computers and other widely used devices, including those running on its own Android software.",
      "That landmark ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sets up a high-stakes drama that will determine the penalties for Google\u2019s misconduct in a search market that it has defined since Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded the company in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Since that austere start, Google has expanded far beyond search to become a powerhouse in email, digital mapping, online video, web browsing, smartphone software and data centers.",
      "Seizing upon its victory in the search case, the Justice Department is now setting out to prove that radical steps must be taken to rein in Google and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\u201cGoogle\u2019s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that \u2014 no matter what occurs \u2014 Google always wins,\u201d the Justice Department argued in documents outlining its proposed penalties. \u201cThe American people thus are forced to accept the unbridled demands and shifting, ideological preferences of an economic leviathan in return for a search engine the public may enjoy.\u201d",
      "Although the proposed penalties were originally made under President Joe Biden's term, they are still being embraced by the Justice Department under President Donald Trump, whose first administration filed the case against Google. Since the change in administrations, the Justice Department has also attempted to cast Google's immense power as a threat to freedom, too.",
      "\u201cThe American dream is about higher values than just cheap goods and \u2018free\u2019 online services,\" the Justice Department wrote in a March 7 filing with Mehta. \u201cThese values include freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to innovate, and freedom to compete in a market undistorted by the controlling hand of a monopolist.\"",
      "Google is arguing the government's proposed changes are unwarranted under a ruling that its search engine popularity among consumers is one of the main reasons it has become so dominant.",
      "The \u201cunprecedented array of proposed remedies would harm consumers and innovation, as well as future competition in search and search ads in addition to numerous other adjacent markets,\u201d Google lawyers said in a filing leading up to hearings. \u201cThey bear little or no relationship to the conduct found anticompetitive, and are contrary to the law.\u201d",
      "Google also is sounding alarms about the proposed requirements to share online search data with rivals and the proposed sale of Chrome posing privacy and security risks. \u201cThe breadth and depth of the proposed remedies risks doing significant damage to a complex ecosystem. Some of the proposed remedies would imperil browser developers and jeopardize the digital security of millions of consumers.\"",
      "The showdown over Google's fate marks the climax of the biggest antitrust case in the U.S. since the Justice Department sued Microsoft in the late 1990s for leveraging its Windows software for personal computers to crush potential rivals.",
      "The Microsoft battle culminated in a federal judge declaring the company an illegal monopoly and ordering a partial breakup \u2014 a remedy that was eventually overturned by an appeals court.",
      "Google intends to file an appeal of Mehta's ruling from last year that branded its search engine as an illegal monopoly but can't do so until the remedy hearings are completed. After closing arguments are presented in late May, Mehta intends to make his decision on the remedies before Labor Day.",
      "The search case marked the first in a succession of antitrust cases that have been brought against a litany of tech giants that include Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, which is currently fighting allegations of running an illegal monopoly in social media in another Washington D.C. trial. Other antitrust cases have been brought against both Apple and Amazon, too.",
      "The Justice Department also targeted Google's digital advertising network in a separate antitrust case that resulted last week in another federal judge's decision that found the company was abusing its power in that market, too. That ruling means Google will be heading into another remedy hearing that could once again raise the specter of a breakup later this year or early next year.",

    "summary": "Nobody knows where whale sharks, the biggest fish in the sea, are mating",
    "story": [
      "Nobody knows where whale sharks, the biggest fish in the sea, are mating",
      "JAMESTOWN, St. Helena -- Whale sharks shouldn't be hard for scientists to find. They are enormous \u2014 they are the biggest fish in the sea and perhaps the biggest fish to have ever lived. They are found in warm oceans all around the world. By shark standards, they are slow swimmers.",
      "But they somehow manage to also be very private: Scientists don't know where they mate, and they've never observed it before.",
      "They do finally have some clues, though. Scientists suspect the magic may be happening in the waters around St. Helena, a remote volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean where Napoleon Bonaparte was once exiled and died. It's the only place in the world where adult male and female whale sharks are known to regularly gather in roughly equal numbers \u2014 and food doesn\u2019t seem to be the main attraction.",
      "Kenickie Andrews, the marine conservation project manager at the St. Helena Trust says he\u2019s seen male sharks chasing females, nibbling on their pectoral fins and \u201cdisplaying themselves\u201d to the female sharks, akin to mating rituals observed in other sharks including great whites.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen here is classic shark courtship behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cTo this day we haven\u2019t seen successful copulation, but it is proof (whale sharks) are in our waters trying out these behaviors.\u201d",
      "Whale sharks typically measure from 12 to 18 meters (39 to 59 feet), weigh up to 14 tons and are plankton eaters; all sharks have a unique pattern of white spots on their upper side.",
      "Scientists say they need to know where the sharks are mating and giving birth so they can protect those areas, possibly by creating marine reserves where threats like fishing are banned. Whale sharks are designated as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; the group says their population has been \u201clargely depleted.\u201d",
      "Simon Pierce, who has studied whale sharks globally, said he has photographed suspected mating scars on female sharks in St. Helena, probably from when male sharks bit their pectoral fins to hold onto them and get into mating position.",
      "Suspected whale shark mating behavior has also been reported in Australia and the sharks also gather in places like Mexico, the Arabian Sea and the Maldives, but that seems to amount to male harassment of immature females, explains Pierce, executive director and co-founder of the charity Marine Megafauna Foundation. That's not the case in St. Helena, where adult males and adult females are present.",
      "Fisheries experts in St. Helena have also provided eyewitness accounts of what they said were instances of whale sharks mating. Officials described a lot of thrashing at the water's surface by two enormous sharks touching belly to belly, but those sightings were not captured on video and are not considered sufficient proof by scientists.",
      "Cameron Perry, a research scientist at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, has been working with colleagues on the island to attach camera tags to investigate what the whale sharks are doing, but have run into some technical difficulties: the sharks dive deeper than 2,000 meters (6,561 feet) and the tags can\u2019t withstand the pressure.",
      "\u201cWe have some very tantalizing and teasing video,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWe have two sharks about to make contact, and then our camera falls off.\u201d",
      "Perry isn\u2019t sure what the sharks might be doing far below the surface, but hopes new technology being developed will help answer that question. \u201cIt\u2019s just a numbers game in terms of how often we can get in the water.\u201d",
      "Alistair Dove, who has previously conducted research in St. Helena, said he\u2019s seen male whale sharks soliciting contact from adult female sharks, including rotating their claspers, or sexual organs, in what he said was \u201cthe sharky equivalent of an erection.\u201d",
      "\"These sexual behaviors are very, very rare in whale sharks,\u201d said Dove, now CEO of the Museum of Science & History in Jacksonville, Florida.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the huge, unanswered questions about the biggest fish in the world,\u201d Dove said.",
      "Andrews, of the St. Helena Trust, said he was hopeful someone might be able to capture video evidence of whale shark mating, but acknowledged the researchers\u2019 presence and tagging efforts might inadvertently alter the sharks\u2019 mating practices.",
      "\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t want to be seen,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe, like everyone else, they need privacy.\u201d",

      "FBI Director Kash Patel announced Judge Hannah Dugan's arrest earlier Friday in a social media post, which was briefly deleted and reposted.",
      "\"Just NOW, the FBI arrested Judge Hannah Dugan out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin on charges of obstruction \u2014 after evidence of Judge Dugan obstructing an immigration arrest operation last week,\" Patel said in the new post. \"We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing the subject \u2014 an illegal alien \u2014 to evade arrest.\"",
      "Dugan was charged with two criminal counts of \"obstructing and impeding a proceeding before a department or agency of the United States\" and \"concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest,\" according to a criminal complaint unsealed Friday.",
      "County court records show the undocumented immigrant -- Eduardo Flores-Ruiz -- was set to appear in court on April 18 before Dugan for a pretrial conference in a case where he has been charged with three misdemeanor counts of battery/domestic abuse connected to an incident on March 12.",
      "The arrest drew protests and condemnation from Wisconsin officials who criticized the move as an overreach on the judicial system.",
      "According to the complaint, Dugan allegedly sought to help Flores-Ruiz evade arrest by federal officers from an ICE task force.",
      "When Judge Dugan learned ICE officers were present in court to arrest Flores-Ruiz, she became \"visibly angry\" and said the situation was \"absurd\" before leaving the bench and entering her chambers, according to the complaint, which cited witnesses who spoke to the FBI.",
      "Judge Dugan and another unidentified judge then allegedly approached the arrest team in the public hallway, according to the complaint. She was \"visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor\" and asked one of the officers whether they were present for a court appearance, the complaint alleged.",
      "When the officer replied they were there to make an arrest, the complaint alleges Judge Dugan asked if they had a judicial warrant, to which the officer responded, \"No I have an administrative warrant.\"",
      "Multiple witnesses cited in the complaint later allegedly said Judge Dugan returned to her courtroom after directing members of the arrest team to the office of the court's chief judge.",
      "\"The courtroom deputy then saw Judge DUGAN get up and heard Judge DUGAN say something like 'Wait, come with me,'\" the complaint states. \"Despite having been advised of the administrative warrant for the arrest of Flores-Ruiz, Judge DUGAN then escorted Flores-Ruiz and his counsel out of the courtroom through the 'jury door,' which leads to a nonpublic area of the courthouse.\"",
      "A DEA agent saw Flores-Ruiz and his attorney in the public hallway of the courthouse and appeared to be making efforts to evade arrest, the complaint says. After he was encountered by FBI and DEA agents outside the building, Flores-Ruiz \"turned around and sprinted down the street\" before he was ultimately apprehended, according to the complaint.",
      "Dugan was arrested Friday morning at the courthouse, a law enforcement official confirmed to ABC News.",
      "She appeared in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on Friday on the two charges, but did not enter a plea. She was released on her own recognizance.",
      "Dugan's attorney Craig Mastantuono said in court, \"Judge Dugan wholeheartedly protests the arrest and believes it was not made in the interests of public safety.\"",
      "If convicted on the charges, Dugan could face up to six years in prison.",
      "The judge's arrest angered Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson who accused the federal agents of \"showboating\" and contended Dugan was not a flight risk.",
      "\"They're just trying to have this show of force and in the process of a court house where people need to go for court proceedings, they're scaring away people from participating in the court process,\" the mayor told reporters.",
      "Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, in a statement on Friday afternoon, responded to the arrest of Milwaukee County circuit judge Hannah Dugan in a statement criticizing President Donald Trump and the White House for what he said were efforts \"to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level.\"",
      "Evers said he would continue to have faith in the justice system \"as this situation plays out in the court of law.\" He did not mention Dugan by name.",
      "Federal prosecutors allege Flores-Ruiz illegally entered the U.S. from Mexico and was issued an Expedited Removal order in January 2013, according to a criminal complaint. Further details about the domestic abuse charges were not immediately available.",

      "The Israeli government has blocked the delivery of all goods, food and medical supplies into Gaza for more than eight weeks.

      "The WHI is a decadeslong research effort on women's health.",
      "The Trump administration has promised to restore funding to a landmark study on women's health days after researchers leading the study announced their funding had been cut -- news that prompted outcry from medical experts and scientists.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement Friday to ABC News that it will restore funding to the Women's Health Initiative, a 30-year study of over 160,000 women that has led to discoveries in women's health on everything from cancer and hormone therapy to chronic disease, aging and osteoporosis.",
      "\"These studies represent critical contributions to our better understanding of women's health. While NIH initially exceeded its internal targets for contract reductions, we are now working to fully restore funding to these essential research efforts,\" the agency said in a statement, referring to the National Institutes of Health, the agency within HHS that oversees the study. \"The NIH remains deeply committed to advancing public health through rigorous gold standard research and we are taking immediate steps to ensure the continuity of these studies.\"",
      "Researchers leading the Women's Health Initiative, or WHI, announced earlier this week that they had been informed HHS would terminate contracts for the study's four regional centers at the end of September. Funding for the study's clinical coordinating center would continue through January 2026, according to the researchers, and then remain uncertain.",
      "Garnet Anderson, Ph.D., principal investigator of the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, told ABC News on Friday that the center has not received confirmation from the NIH that funding for the study will be restored.",
      "She added that while she hopes the funding for the WHI is restored, she is also worried that it may come at the expense of funding for \"other, equally deserving studies.\"",
      "\"The decision-making process now is opaque,\" Anderson told ABC News by email. \"It isn't clear that we are getting the best return on our investment -- prioritizing and supporting research on the most important issues in public health and the most promising scientific opportunities.\"",
      "Anderson's work on the WHI over the past 30 years included research on hormone therapy and women.",
      "Additional discoveries stemming from the decades' worth of data collected by the WHI include major information on preventing chronic disease in women; slowing memory loss; preventing and treating breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers in women; and better understanding of how conditions earlier in life like pregnancy, preeclampsia and gestational diabetes impact women later in life, according to Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, one of the long-term principal investigators of the WHI.",
      "\"This is the largest and most groundbreaking study of women's health, and we're learning so much about prevention of chronic disease, healthy aging, extending health span, years of life that are free of major chronic diseases with good memory and cognition and mobility, and quality of life,\" Manson, who is also Preventive Medicine division chief at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a Harvard Medical School professor, told ABC News on Thursday.",
      "Manson said the research findings the WHI continues to produce have not only shaped public health guidelines and clinical health guidelines, meaning the medical advice doctors give to patients, but have also shaped a generation of researchers of women's health.",
      "\"There have been more than 5,000 investigators who have been involved with publications and with the science, and it will be difficult to keep that together,\" she said of the potential impact of the funding cuts. \"Also, the WHI has played an enormous role in training and mentoring the next generation of researchers in women's health and healthy aging that is likely to be disrupted.\"",

      "Manson and other researchers noted that the sudden announcement of the funding cuts and now the possible reversal to restore funding have thrown their work into chaos.",
      "\"We've got blood samples, literally hundreds of thousands of blood samples, that have been collected over the years. It isn't clear if those bio-specimens can be fully utilized and used to advance the science that is also threatened,\" Manson said, later adding, \"We need to see whether these bio-specimens can be preserved, whether they can still be made available for ancillary study by investigators around the country, whether new biomarkers can be measured in these blood samples -- it's really unclear.\"",
      "On Friday, Manson told ABC News that she has not received confirmation from the NIH that funding for the study would continue.",
      "A third WHI regional center, located at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, also told ABC News Friday it had not been informed by the NIH of a decision to restore funding.",
      "Dr. Marian Neuhouser, a principal investigator of the WHI at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, said one of the primary duties of the study's regional centers, whose funding was originally set to be terminated in September, is to continually collect data from the tens of thousands of women still enrolled in the study.",
      "\"There aren't many studies that have such a large database of older women. We have something like 13,000 women over the age of 90 and some up to age 108,\" Neuhouser told ABC News on Thursday. \"We need to learn about these women -- what keeps them healthy, what puts them at risk, how people can remain living independently. This information helps clinicians as they interact with patients.\"",
      "She added of the women enrolled in the WHI, \"They want to be studied. They want to be part of the answer.\"",
      "Experts like Neuhouser note that the work of the WHI is landmark in part because as recently as three decades ago, women were not required to be included in medical research.",
      "In the 1970s, for example, the first clinical studies on the effects of estrogen -- the sex hormone responsible for female physical features and reproduction -- were done on men.",

      "The Trump administration is giving individuals who are given a notice of removal under the Alien Enemies Act \"no less than 12 hours\" to indicate their intent to file a habeas petition to contest their deportation, and \"no less than 24 hours\" to file it, according to a newly unsealed document.",
      "The sworn declaration by Carlos Cisneros, the assistant field office director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was unsealed by a federal judge in the Southern District of Texas who temporarily blocked the government from deporting Venezuelans held in the El Valle Detention Center in Texas earlier this month.",

      "\"If the alien does express an intent to file a habeas petition, the alien is given a reasonable amount of time, and no less than 24 hours, to actually file that petition,\" Cisneros said.",
      "The Trump administration last month touched off a legal battle when it invoked the Alien Enemies Act -- an 18th century wartime authority used to remove noncitizens with little-to-no due process -- to deport two planeloads of alleged migrant gang members to the CECOT mega-prison in El Salvador by arguing that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is a \"hybrid criminal state\" that is invading the United States.",
      "An official with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acknowledged that \"many\" of the men deported on March 15 lack criminal records in the United States -- but said that \"the lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose\" and \"demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile.\"",

      "Their efforts come during a debate among Democrats over how to respond to Trump.",
      "As the Democratic Party takes stock of the first 100 days of the Trump administration and the upcoming 2026 midterm elections -- where the party aims to take back control of the U.S. House of Representatives \u2013 a slate of political newcomers are challenging longtime incumbents and calling for generational change within the party.",
      "The challenges come amid a broader debate among Democrats over how to respond to the Trump administration and reach voters after its bruising losses in 2024, and if the party needs younger leaders to revitalize it or whether Democrats should avoid the risk of infighting.",
      "The debate was supercharged in recent weeks when Leaders We Deserve, a political organization led by Democratic National Committee Vice Chairman David Hogg, the Parkland school shooting survivor and gun-control activistannounced that it will spend $20 million to help elect younger leaders -- including primary challengers to House Democrats who are in safe Democratic seats.",
      "The group has not yet announced who it is supporting.",
      "\"Given the loss that we had last cycle, a lot of people have expressed their frustration with our leadership,\" Tamia Booker, a veteran Democratic strategist, told ABC News. \"I think what we're seeing now is the ramification of that, where people are deciding to run themselves because they believe that they're more effective leaders.\"",
      "Jake Rakov, 37, is a primary challenger taking on his former boss -- Rep. Brad Sherman, a Democrat who represents California's 32nd District.",
      "\"I'm running because we do need a new generation of Democrats to step up if we want anything to change in Washington; we cannot keep sending the same both decade after decade, and expecting things to change,\" Rakov told ABC News in an interview.",
      "Rakov worked for Sherman as a deputy communications director in 2017 and since then worked in Los Angeles politics and some campaigns.",
      "But he slammed Sherman as ineffective, adding, \"He likes to brag about seniority. He has been passed over for leadership positions on his committees ... Seniority doesn't matter if no one is willing to work with you.\"",
      "Sherman, in an interview with ABC News, pointed to his position as a ranking member on the House Financial Subcommittee on Capital Markets, and that other experienced members also often get passed over for leadership positions.",
      "But Rakov is not attacking Sherman on policy. Instead, he said, \"I think there is enough of that want of generational change,\" adding that it is not about age but about people wanting their members of Congress \"to be accessible and accountable and to actually meet voters where they are emotionally.\"",
      "Sherman, speaking to ABC News, dismissed Rakov -- who he indicated had not worked with him directly -- as one of an expected number of challengers.",
      "\"I always have lots of opponents and I usually win by a huge margin,\" Sherman said.",
      "More generally, Sherman sounded a skeptical note on the efforts to primary incumbents more generally.",
      "\"I see these efforts to turn the Democratic Party into a circular firing squad \u2026 It's very difficult to see how their efforts will help us win the 2026 elections. What it means is that we waste a lot of money in the primaries,\" he said.",
      "In Indiana's 7th Congressional District, which includes much of Indianapolis, George Hornedo, a 34-year-old alum of the Obama administration and Pete Buttigieg's 2020 presidential campaign, is challenging incumbent Democratic Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson. Hornedo alleges that Carson, 50, who was first elected to the House in 2008, has not delivered for the district.",
      "\"I'm running because my community here in Indianapolis is still waiting for everything from safer streets to affordable housing to, really, just real leadership,\" Hornedo told ABC News. \"After nearly 20 years in Congress, it's clear that Congressman Carson is just holding the seat but not actually doing anything with it.\"",
      "But Hornedo does not think the divide is simply about age or time in office. The split, he said, is between members \"like Congressman Carson\" who think the current institutions in place are working for people, \"versus those like myself that acknowledge that, of course, we have to try and protect what we currently have, but we also have to acknowledge that President Trump and Elon Musk are actively dismantling government day in and day out.\"",
      "Carson told ABC News he welcomes new voices but thinks that Democrats need to work together under a common goal -- and he pushed back against Hornedo's claims.",
      "Carson pointed to the bills he's worked on that have been signed into law, as well as his work across the aisle with Republicans and the federal funding he has delivered to Indianapolis as testament to his effectiveness.",
      "But Carson also believes his own background makes him a nontraditional member of Congress already: \"I think I'm one of the few members of Congress that have ever lived in a homeless shelter \u2026 along with my grandmother, I was raised by the community. I was raised by the village, and so I'm always sensitive to the needs of the downtrodden and the less fortunate.\"",
      "In nearby Illinois, Kat Abughazaleh, 26, a former reporter and researcher with a large social media following, announced in March that she would run for Congress in Illinois' 9th Congressional District -- currently represented by Rep. Jan Schakowsky, 80, who has not yet announced if she will run for reelection.",
      "Abughazaleh has had some early success on the fundraising front, raising more than $375,000 in the first week of her campaign, according to Federal Election Commission filings. She outraised what Schakowsky fundraised in the entire first quarter.",
      "Abughazaleh is quick to emphasize that her run is not a \"vendetta\" against the incumbent -- but she says the Democratic Party is discouraging primaries and critiques in general.",
      "\"It's time for new ideas. If what we were doing was working, then we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place,\" Abughazaleh told ABC News.",
      "Abughazaleh pointed to her own life experiences that dovetail with what younger generations are experiencing -- as someone from a generation dealing with school shooting drills, out-of-pocket medical costs, and spending most of her income on rent -- as differentiating herself from longtime members.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, Schakowsky said she will decide on her own plans \"soon, but if I do indeed decide to retire, there are dozens of talented leaders, advocates, and organizers in the 9th Congressional District who know our community and who are ready to lead the charge as we fight back against the extreme MAGA regime and Trump's shameful policies.\"",
      "She also said she has \"always encouraged more participation in the democratic process.\"",
      "On Wednesday, she posted on X that she still had not yet made a decision about running.",
      "In Georgia, Everton Blair, 32, grew up in the Peach State's 13th Congressional District, which spans the eastern metro Atlanta area. He made history as the youngest, first Black, and first openly gay person elected to the Gwinnett County Board of Education, where he went on to serve as chair.",
      "Blair is now setting his sights on his next role in public office.",
      "\"I'm running because District 13, my home turf, deserves better leadership. And I think we learned a very important lesson in November and we need to respond immediately to the chaos of this administration with stronger, more competent and forceful leadership,\" Blair told ABC News in an interview.",
      "Incumbent Rep. David Scott has held the seat for 22 years, following a career in the Georgia General Assembly. Blair argues that Georgia's 13th Congressional District needs a leader who is \"agile and present\" -- qualities he no longer sees in Scott.",
      "\"When somebody's served in elected office for over 50 years, there comes a time where you have to ask when you're actually ready to prepare the next generation of leadership.\"",
      "Spokespeople for Scott did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Across the country on the West Coast, Saikat Chakrabarti, 39, is mounting a primary campaign against one of the Democratic Party's most prominent figures -- Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who has represented San Francisco for about 38 years.",
      "A former Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur and founding engineer of the online payment platform Stripe, Chakrabarti got his start in politics working on Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "Asked why he believes he can unseat a party heavyweight, Chakrabarti told ABC News he's done it before. He served as campaign manager for Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez during her 2018 upset victory over Democratic incumbent Joe Crowley.",
      "Chakrabarti sees echoes of 2018 in 2025: a post-Trump election environment marked by frustration among Democrats over their party's defeat.",
      "\"That moment of change, in my opinion, is dwarfed by the moment of change you see right now. The level of anger at the Democratic Party for failing is huge,\" Chakrabarti said.",
      "Chakrabarti added that those who want to stand up to Trump should also have the courage to stand up to members of their own party, including Pelosi, 85.",
      "\"The one thing we know is if we go into 2028 with the party being what it is right now, we're in trouble,\" Chakrabarti said.",
      "Pelosi's office declined a request for comment.",
      "Booker, the strategist, told ABC News that the younger candidates generally will have the challenge of building up name recognition among voters -- who may already have strong connections to the incumbents.",
      "\"As humans, we are very connected to who our person is. A lot of these members that have been in these seats a long time also have deep relationships, and they also have a lot of money, and those deep relationships also extend to the donors,\" she said.",
      "\"So while I'm all about supporting young people to run, they have to be thoughtful \u2026 so they can actually have a well-oiled campaign, because otherwise they're going to be, yes, a challenger, but they're not going to be able to be successful in these runs for office.\"",

      "A \"dirty line\" is the nickname given to a commercial internet line that is used to connect to websites that would not be available on the Pentagon's unclassified (NIPR) or classified (SIPR) lines.",
      "This dirty line was installed at Hegseth's request so he could use the Signal app on the personal computer, the sources said.",

      "On Tuesday, Hegseth strongly denied that what he shared over a second group chat on the Signal messaging app were classified war plans about imminent U.S. airstrikes targeting Houthi militants in Yemen, and blamed former staffers for leaking, accusing them of going to the news media with new information to \"sabotage\" Trump's agenda.",
      "Hegseth and other administration officials have insisted that the information about those airstrikes that was shared earlier with another Signal group established by national security adviser Mike Waltz was not classified.",
      "On Tuesday, Hegseth continued to make that case as questions have been raised about how he shared similar information with a smaller Signal group that sources told ABC News included his wife, brother, and personal attorney.",
      "\"I look at war plans every single day. What was shared over Signal then and now, however you characterize it, was informal unclassified coordination for media coordination other things. That's what I've said from the beginning,\" Hegseth said in a live interview from the Pentagon on \"Fox & Friends.\"",
      "Sources familiar with the chat had earlier told ABC News that Hegseth had established the Signal group with family and friends during his Senate confirmation process.

    "story": [
      "Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program will return Saturday to the secluded sultanate of Oman",
      "MUSCAT, Oman -- Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program will return Saturday to the secluded sultanate of Oman, where experts on both sides will start hammering the technical details of any possible deal.",
      "The talks seek to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic closing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Neither Iran nor the U.S. have offered any explanation on why the talks will return to the Omani capital of Muscat, nestled in the Hajar Mountains. Oman has been a mediator between the countries. Last weekend's talks in Rome offered a more-equal flight distance between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, who are leading the negotiations.",
      "But Rome remains in mourning after the death of Pope Francis, whose funeral will be Saturday. And Iranian state television, in covering last weekend's talks, complained at length on air about the \u201cpaparazzi\u201d gathered across the street from the Omani Embassy in Rome's Camilluccia neighborhood.",
      "\u201cAs you can see, unlike the first round of talks where the presence of journalists was limited and the Omanis had special management in place to prevent a large and chaotic media presence from disrupting the negotiations, this time in Rome, Italy, that kind of control hasn\u2019t been applied,\u201d said Hosnieh Sadat Shobeiri, an Iranian state TV journalist in gray, all-encompassing chador.",
      "\u201cBecause of the crowd we\u2019re seeing here, with media outlets from various countries \u2014 including some that are anti-Iran \u2014 it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll hear more conflicting reports and news aimed at disrupting the talks coming out of Rome compared to Oman.\u201d",
      "The Muscat talks come as Iran appears to have lined up Chinese and Russian support. Araghchi traveled to Moscow last week and this week visited Beijing.",
      "On Thursday, Chinese, Iran and Russian representatives met the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog that likely will verify compliance with any accord like it did with Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. That deal included China and Russia, as well as France, Germany and the United Kingdom.",
      "However, Iran has greatly restricted the IAEA's inspections \u2014 leading to fears internationally that centrifuges and other nuclear material could be diverted.",
      "The IAEA offered no readout from the talks, but China's state-run Xinhua news agency on Friday described the three nations as saying the agency has \u201cthe necessary potential and expertise to contribute constructively to this process.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina, Russia and Iran emphasized that political and diplomatic engagement based on mutual respect remains the only viable and practical path for resolving the Iran nuclear issue,\u201d the report said. It added that China respects Iran's \u201cright to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has kept France, Germany and the U.K. out of its direct negotiations with Iran, something similarly reflected in Witkoff's negotiations with Russia over ending its war on Ukraine.",
      "Araghchi meanwhile has said he's open to visiting Berlin, London and Paris to discuss the negotiations.",
      "\u201cThe ball is now in the E3\u2019s court,\u201d Araghchi wrote on the social platform X on Thursday, using an acronym for the countries. \u201cThey have an opportunity to do away with the grip of Special Interest groups and forge a different path. How we act at this critical junction is likely to define the foreseeable future.\u201d",
      "The U.S. technical team was expected to arrive in Oman on Friday ahead of the talks Saturday. They'll be led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's policy planning staff. Anton does not have the nuclear policy experience of those who led America's efforts in the 2015 talks. However, he was an early supporter of Trump, describing the 2016 election as a \u201ccharge the cockpit or you die\u201d vote.",
      "\u201cA Hillary Clinton presidency is Russian Roulette with a semi-auto,\u201d Anton wrote. \u201cWith Trump, at least you can spin the cylinder and take your chances.\u201d",
      "He also criticized \u201cIran sycophancy\u201d in the same essay.",
      "Rubio, speaking on a podcast released this week, also kept up a Trump line that Iran needed to stop its enrichment of uranium entirely.",
      "\u201cIf Iran wants a civil nuclear program, they can have one just like many other countries can have one, and that is they import enriched material,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "But Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. Witkoff also has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop.",
      "Meanwhile, one more wildcard is Israel, whose devastating war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip grinds on. Trump initially announced the Iran talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his side. But Israel, which for years has targeted Iran's nuclear program with attacks on its facilities and scientists, has kept open the possibility of airstrikes to destroy Tehran's enrichment sites.",
      "On Monday, Israel's military conducted drills preparing for possible new Iranian missile attacks, the country's public broadcaster KAN reported.",
      "\u201cOur security services are on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate response,\u201d Araghchi wrote Wednesday on X.",

      "President Donald Trump is badgering the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but even if the Fed gave in to the pressure, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily lead to lower borrowing costs for consumers",
      "President Donald Trump is badgering the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but even if the Fed gave in to the pressure, it wouldn't necessarily lead to lower borrowing costs for consumers.",
      "In fact, economists say, Trump's ongoing attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his tariff policies could keep the longer-term interest rates that matter for consumers and businesses higher than they otherwise would be. A less-independent Fed can lead, over time, to higher borrowing costs, as investors worry that inflation may spike in the future. As a result they demand higher yields to own Treasury securities.",
      "Trump has repeatedly urged Powell to cut the short-term interest rate that the central bank controls. The Fed typically reduces its rate during an economic downturn to encourage more borrowing and spending, and raises it to cool the economy and fight inflation when prices rise.",
      "But long-term rates on things like mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards are largely set by market forces. And in recent weeks, fears that Trump's sweeping tariffs could raise inflation, along with the administration's threats to the Fed's independence, have led markets to push those longer term rates higher. It's not clear that the Fed can fully reverse those trends by itself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not automatically true that even if the Fed were to cut rates, that you would see a measured decline in long-term interest rates,\u201d Francesco Bianchi, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, said. \u201cThis kind of pressure on the Fed might backfire...if markets don't believe the Fed has inflation under control.\"",
      "Trump renewed calls on Wednesday and Thursday for Powell to reduce the Fed's short-term rate, telling reporters that the chair is \u201cmaking a mistake\u201d by not doing so.",
      "And last week, Trump suggested he could fire Powell, while a top aide said that the White House was \u201cstudying\u201d whether it could do so.",
      "Stock markets plunged in response, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose, and the dollar fell, an unusual combination that suggested investors were selling most American assets. Markets recovered those losses after Trump said on Tuesday that he had \u201cno intention\u201d of firing the Fed chair.",
      "Still, the threats to the Fed's independence unnerved Wall Street investors, because they see a Fed free from political pressure as critical to keeping inflation in check. An independent Fed can take unpopular steps, such as raising rates, to fight inflation.",
      "\u201cThreatening the Fed doesn\u2019t soothe markets \u2014 it spooks them,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, chief market strategist at New York Life Investments. \u201cAnd the result is often the opposite of what any administration wants to see: higher rates, weaker confidence, and more market turmoil.\u201d",
      "Since Trump began imposing tariffs in early March, when he slapped duties on Canada and Mexico, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen from 4.15% to about 4.3%. The yield is a benchmark for mortgage rates and other borrowing. Mortgage rates, in turn, have increased during that time, from 6.6% to 6.8%.",
      "While Trump says he is negotiating over tariffs with many countries, most economists expect some level of duties to remain in place for at least this year, including his 10% duties on nearly all imports.",
      "The 10-year yield did fall Thursday when two Federal Reserve officials said that rate cuts are possible as soon as this summer, should the economy falter and unemployment rise.",
      "Yet last fall, longer-term interest rates also fell in anticipation of rate cuts, but then rose once the Fed cut in September and then continued to rise as the central bank reduced its rate again in November \u2014 two days after the election \u2014 and in December. Mortgage rates are now higher than they were when the Fed cut.",
      "A range of factors can affect longer-term Treasury rates, including expectations for future growth and inflation, as well as the supply and demand for government bonds. Bianchi worries that stubbornly high government budget deficits \u2014 which are financed by trillions of dollars of Treasurys \u2014 could also lift long-term rates.",
      "Should the Fed cut rates now, llonger-term borrowing costs \u201cwould move in the opposite direction, absolutely,\u201d Goodwin said, \u201cbecause the threat of inflation is so palpable -- that move would call their credibility into question.\"",
      "Trump said in a social media post this week that there is \u201cvirtually No Inflation\u201d and as a result, the Fed should lower its key rate, from its current level of about 4.3%. Many economists expect the central bank will do so this year. But Powell has underscored that the central bank wants to evaluate the impact of Trump's policies before making any moves.",
      "Inflation has fallen in recent months, dropping to 2.4% in March, the lowest level since last September. Yet excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core inflation was 2.8%. Core prices often provide a better signal of where inflation is headed.",
      "A key issue for the Fed is that the economy is very different now than it was during Trump's first term. Back then inflation was actually below the Fed's target. At that time, it was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to cut rates, Bianchi said, if there was a threat of a recession, because inflation wasn't an issue.",
      "But now, tariffs will almost certainly lift prices in the coming months, at least temporarily. That raises the bar much higher for a Fed rate cut, Bianchi said.",
      "Still, once there are clear signs the economy is deteriorating, such as a rising unemployment rate, the Fed will cut rates, regardless of what Trump does, economists said.",
      "Trump on Monday accused Powell of often being \u201ctoo late\u201d with his rate decisions, but ironically the Fed may move more slowly this time because of the threat of higher prices from tariffs. Without clear evidence of a downturn, Fed officials would worry about being seen as giving in to political pressure from Trump if they cut.",
      "\u201cPowell knows the irreparable damage that would occur if it was perceived that he cut because he was forced to by Trump,\u201d said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income.",
      "The Fed now \u201cwill be even more delayed because I think you\u2019re going get more of an inflation lift initially, before you get the more pronounced slowing in growth,\" Porcelli said.",
      "Either way it may take more than a Fed cut or two to bring down longer-term borrowing costs, Bianchi said.",
      "\u201cTo really lower long-term rates you need to provide a stable macroeconomic environment, and right now we are not there yet,\" he added.",

      "College journalists across the U.S. are navigating a surge in requests to remove previously published content amid the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on student protesters and what critics describe as unprecedented attacks on campus speech",
      "CHICAGO -- Over the past few weeks, Greta Reich, editor-in-chief of Stanford University\u2019s student newspaper, has had almost two dozen requests to take down quotes, bylines, photos and opinion articles from current and former sources and writers.",
      "She and her staff at the Stanford Daily have been reviewing them on a case-by-case basis.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a number that has been startling to see,\u201d Reich said.",
      "Other student journalists on college campuses across the country are fielding similar requests. They are being asked to remove previously published content amid the Trump administration's crackdown on student protesters, fears of deportation for international students and what critics have described as unprecedented attacks on campus speech.",
      "Many young editors are beginning to reconsider long-standing journalistic practices around transparency to protect the people who appear in their reports. It's happening amid a climate of fear on campuses that is causing certain students to be reluctant to speak out publicly.",
      "These dramatic shifts in student media escalated after R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, was threatened with deportation and detained in March over what her lawyers say is apparent retaliation for an op-ed piece she co-wrote in the student newspaper. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was among four students who wrote the op-ed in the campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, criticizing the university\u2019s response to student activists demanding that Tufts \u201cacknowledge the Palestinian genocide,\u201d disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.",
      "And Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and Palestinian activist, was arrested in March and has been held in a Louisiana detention center for more than six weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 1,000 students at 160 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review. The federal government has since announced it will reverse the termination of legal status for international students after many filed court challenges, a government lawyer said Friday.",
      "The need to consider high-stakes safety risks has increased pressure on students in newsrooms that are meant to be learning labs for future journalists.",
      "Emma Wozniak, editor-in-chief of The Lantern at Ohio State University, where 12 students had their visas revoked, said it's \u201ctaken a mental toll\u201d on staff members.",
      "\u201cWe feel an enormous pressure to do the right thing because the stakes are higher and we don\u2019t want to put anyone in danger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that something we put out into the world could have such a devastating impact on someone. And so we take that very seriously.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, the Student Press Law Center and other media rights groups issued guidance urging student journalists to be more flexible about requests to take down content.",
      "\u201cThis is something we\u2019ve never, ever done before,\u201d said Mike Hiestand, senior legal counsel for the center. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented. But we felt it was important to respond to what we were hearing from students.\u201d",
      "Hiestand said he\u2019s seen a surge in calls from student journalists facing requests to take down content, remove bylines or offer anonymous sourcing. Some of the calls have been from international students concerned about how to protect themselves while working in campus newsrooms. Many, fearing legal repercussions, have decided to retract their names in the bylines of published articles or opinion pieces.",
      "\u201cPeople are really concerned, really fearful,\u201d he said.",
      "The Stanford Daily has seen multiple staff members step away from editing positions or from covering certain stories related to the Israel-Hamas war or President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs, Reich said.",
      "Since returning to the White House, Trump, a Republican, has threatened funding for universities over what he calls \u201cwokeness\u201d and diversity efforts in education, and he has launched an unprecedented campaign of immigration enforcement that has pushed the limits of executive power and clashed with federal judges trying to restrain him.",
      "The Stanford Daily published a letter from the editor in April addressing a \u201cchilling effect we\u2019ve noticed on campus and the fear of speaking to the Daily\u201d and announcing more leniency in granting anonymity for students who feel threatened. Three days before, the Daily reported that six student visas had been revoked by federal authorities.",
      "Reich said she worries about the diversity in voices the Daily may be losing because international students especially are afraid to speak with reporters or join the newsroom.",
      "\u201cWhen we have an entire section of the student body scared to have their stories told, that\u2019s a significant portion of the life of Stanford that just isn\u2019t being told,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s wildly concerning.\u201d",
      "Adam Kinder, editor-in-chief of the Columbia Political Review, said he\u2019s had about half a dozen requests from student writers wanting to put the publishing process on hold and a similar number of requests to take down previously published articles.",
      "Many of the requests have been from international students \u201cbecause of the very real fear right now, including the fear of deportation,\u201d Kinder said. The publication reversed a previous rule restricting non-bylined articles.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that we\u2019re getting more of these requests than we ever had before,\u201d he said.",
      "Dylan Hembrough, editor-in-chief of the Alestle at Southern Illinois University, said he\u2019s also being more flexible with taking down previously published content, removing bylines from staff writers and offering anonymity. That includes for an upcoming story about eight international students at the school who have had their visas revoked.",
      "The Alestle\u2019s staff is working on a new policy for removing previously published content.",
      "\u201cOffering anonymity now is important because for some of these people, their lives could be completely upended at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d Hembrough said. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are more important than a good story.\u201d",
      "Jane Kirtley, a University of Minnesota media ethics professor, acknowledged that the current moment \u201craises a whole new set of ethical issues that may feel much more existential.\u201d But she encouraged student journalists to slow down when deciding how to weigh minimizing harm with other ethical standards, including to seek the truth and report it and to tell the full story of what is happening.",
      "Kirtley said anonymous sourcing and non-bylined work can appear less credible. Removing previously published content can have lasting effects, given that journalism is often called the first draft of history.",
      "\u201cYou have to ask yourself, what am I doing to the historical record, especially amid attempts in the current administration to rewrite history,\u201d she said.",

      "Chief Deputy District Attorney Katharine Decker told jurors the damage to Bartell\u2019s car was consistent with Koenig \u2014 who is left-handed and was driving \u2014 throwing the rock, shotput-style, out the driver\u2019s side window at Bartell\u2019s car as one of the friends, Nicholas Karol-Chik, testified. Even if jurors weren\u2019t convinced Koenig threw the rock, she had urged them to still find him guilty of first-degree murder as a conspirator with his friends, who both pleaded guilty to lesser charges.",
      "The defense didn't dispute that Koenig participated in the night of rock-throwing but said the third defendant, Zachary Kwak, threw the fatal rock. His attorneys argued Koenig did not know anyone had been hurt until Bartell's car went off the road, and that he had borderline personality disorder, which affected his impulse control and judgment.",
      "One of Koenig's lawyers, Martin Stuart, told jurors to instead find him guilty of manslaughter, the least serious charge he faced in Bartell's death, because he didn't knowingly try to kill her. Jurors also had the option of finding Koenig guilty of manslaughter as a conspirator, even if they didn't think he threw the rock himself.",
      "On April 19, 2023, after seeing Bartell\u2019s car leave the road after being hit, the three friends circled back a few times to look again, according to testimony and investigators. One of them, Kwak, took a photo as a memento but no one checked on the driver or called for help, according to their testimony.",
      "Bartell's body would not be discovered until her girlfriend, Jenna Griggs, who was on the phone with her that night when the call abruptly cut out, tracked her phone to the field, she testified. The only DNA found on the fatal rock was Bartell's, making the testimony from Kwak and Karol-Chik key to the prosecution.",
      "The friends agreed not to talk to anyone about what had happened. But Kwak, the newest one to the group, later told investigators that Koenig had thrown the fatal rock. Karol-Chik, who said Koenig was like a \u201cbrother\u201d to him, pointed the finger at Kwak before changing his story and saying that Koenig had thrown the rock that killed Bartell.",
      "Karol-Chik, who was sitting in the passenger seat of the pickup as Koenig drove, testified that Koenig seemed \u201cexcited\u201d as they drove by Bartell's car and at one point made a \u201cwhoop\u201d sound.",
      "\u201cIt sounded like him celebrating,\u201d said Karol-Chik, who admitted he had placed the fatal rock next to Koenig so he could grab it and throw it as he drove.",
      "Koenig's lawyers tried to cast doubt on the reliability of the other men's accounts.",
      "\u201cYou have no reason to believe me but I also have no reason to protect anyone anymore,\" Karol-Chik said on cross-examination.",
      "Karol-Chik and Kwak contradicted one another on a key point. Karol-Chik said they all threw about 10 rocks each that night. Kwak said he didn't throw any. The defense pointed out that Kwak did not say Koenig had thrown the rock until a detective told him someone had accused Kwak himself of doing it.",
      "But in their questioning of the friends, the defense also stressed that none of the three had intended to hurt anyone.",
      "Kwak entered into a plea deal first, pleading guilty in May 2024 to first-degree assault in Bartell\u2019s death, acknowledging that he acted in a way that created a grave risk of death. He also pleaded guilty to second-degree assault and attempted second-degree assault for the rocks that were thrown earlier in the night. He faces between 20 and 32 years in prison, prosecutors said.",
      "About a week later, Karol-Chik pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and committing a crime of violence. He also pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree murder for throwing rocks at a total of nine people that night and earlier in 2023.",
      "Under his plea agreement, Karol-Chik could be sent to prison for between 35 and 72 years in prison when he is sentenced.",

      "A government lawyer said the federal government is reversing the termination of legal status for international students after many filed court challenges around the U.S. Judges around the country had already issued temporary orders restoring the studen...",
      "The federal government is reversing the termination of legal status for international students after many filed court challenges around the U.S., a government lawyer said Friday.",
      "Judges around the country had already issued temporary orders restoring the students' records in a federal database of international students maintained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. The records had been suddenly terminated in recent weeks, often without the students or their schools being notified.",
      "A lawyer for the government read a statement in federal court in Oakland that said ICE was manually restoring the student status for people whose records were terminated in recent weeks. A similar statement was read by a government attorney in a separate case in Washington on Friday, said lawyer Brian Green, who represents the plaintiff in that case. Green provided The Associated Press with a copy of the statement that the government lawyer emailed to him.",
      "It says: \u201cICE is developing a policy that will provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations. Until such a policy is issued, the SEVIS records for plaintiff(s) in this case (and other similarly situated plaintiffs) will remain Active or shall be re-activated if not currently active and ICE will not modify the record solely based on the NCIC finding that resulted in the recent SEVIS record termination.\"",
      "Green said that the government lawyer said it would apply to all students in the same situation, not just those who had filed lawsuits.",
      "SEVIS is the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database that tracks international students' compliance with their visa status. NCIC is the National Crime Information Center, which is maintained by the FBI. Many of the students whose records were terminated were told that their status was terminated as a result of a criminal records check or that their visa had been revoked.",
      "International students and their schools were caught off guard by the terminations of the students' records. Many of the terminations were discovered when school officials were doing routine checks of the international student database or when they checked specifically after hearing about other terminations.",

      "Forecasters are warning of low humidity and gusty wind increased the risk fire could spread across parts of New Jersey, Philadelphia and its suburbs and Delaware as firefighters continued to battled a vast wildfire in the Pine Barrens",
      "Forecasters on Friday warned low humidity and gusty wind increased the risk that fire could develop across parts of New Jersey, Philadelphia and its suburbs and Delaware as firefighters continued to battle a vast wildfire in the Pine Barrens.",
      "The National Weather Service discouraged any outdoor burning with low humidity, temperatures reaching near 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) and southerly winds that could gust up to 20 mph (32 kph) across a swath of the Mid-Atlantic. There's a chance of rain over the weekend in the region.",
      "In its most recent update, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service said about half of the fire spread over nearly 24 square miles (62 square kilometers) in the southern part of the state was contained. No injuries or deaths have been reported, but buildings have burned along with cars. Officials have charged a 19-year-old man from the area with starting the blaze that led to the wildfire.",
      "Prosecutors on Thursday said Joseph Kling, 19, from Waretown, New Jersey, was arrested and charged with arson and aggravated arson, saying he lit wooden pallets on fire and left the area before they were fully put out.",
      "A public defender representing him during the hearing said she had \u201cnothing further\u201d when asked by a judge.",
      "Emails from the public defender\u2019s office said Thursday it could not comment on a pending case so early in the process. An email message seeking comment on his behalf was sent Friday to the public defender's office. Attempts to reach Kling by phone were not successful.",
      "Authorities first spotted the blaze Tuesday morning from a fire tower when a smoke column appeared amid the pines. Law enforcement said they used a GPS to plot the origin of the fire and determined the cause was a bonfire that hadn\u2019t been put out.",
      "Speaking Thursday afternoon at a news conference, Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer said \u201cwe can confidently say that we think the fire was set intentionally.\u201d He declined further comment on why authorities believe the man they arrested was responsible and other matters related to the investigation since it remains ongoing.",
      "It's forest fire season in the pinelands, a wilderness that encompasses more than 1 million acres (405,000 hectares) \u2014 an area roughly as large as the Grand Canyon. Firefighters are contending with low humidity and the aftermath of a monthslong drought in the region.",
      "Though parts of the Pine Barrens are uninhabited, New Jersey is the nation\u2019s most densely populated state and officials have warned the fire could threaten developments nearby. The fire had grown to more than 23.8 square miles (about 62 square kilometers) on Thursday.",
      "Officials said the fire is believed to be the second-worst in recent years in New Jersey, smaller only than a 2007 blaze that burned 26 square miles (67 square kilometers).",
      "Jim and Lenore Thoms, who own a business in an industrial park near the blaze, called the fire \u201ca very scary experience\u201d and praised the efforts of firefighters.",
      "\u201cThe firefighters were phenomenal, they saved this whole park,\u201d Jim Thoms said. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t around, the way things were going on, you might not have seen any buildings at all.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, New York officials warned of higher-than-normal pollution levels were possible in New York City, Rockland and Westchester counties, and in Long Island\u2019s Nassau and Suffolk counties.",
      "The fire is roughly 54 miles (87 kilometers) south of New York City. It's about 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of Philadelphia.",
      "Officials said the fire is believed to be the second-worst in recent years, smaller only than a 2007 blaze that burned 26 square miles (67 square kilometers).",
      "Video released by the state agency overseeing the fire service showed billowing white and black clouds of smoke, intense flames engulfing pines and firefighters dousing a charred structure.",
      "The Pine Barrens sit between Philadelphia to the west and the Atlantic coast to the east. In the region with quick-draining sandy soil and trees with still-developing leaves, humidity remains low and winds can kick up, drying out the forest floor.",

      "Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has launched an unprecedented campaign of immigration enforcement that has pushed the limits of executive power and clashed with federal judges trying to restrain him. But unlike in his first term, Trump\u2019s efforts have not sparked the kind of widespread condemnation or protests that led him to retreat from some unpopular positions.",
      "Instead, immigration has emerged as one of Trump\u2019s strongest issues in public polling, reflecting both his grip on the Republican base and a broader shift in public sentiment that is driven in part, interviews suggest, by anger at the policies of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "The White House has seized on this shift, mocking critics and egging on Democrats to engage on an issue that Trump's team sees as a win.",
      "\u201cAmerica\u2019s changed,\u201d said pollster Frank Luntz, a longtime ally of Republicans who has been holding focus groups with voters to discuss immigration. \u201cThis is the one area where Donald Trump still has significant and widespread public support.\u201d",
      "Luntz said voters dismayed by the historically large influx of migrants under Biden are now \u201cprepared to accept a more extreme approach.\"",
      "\u201cMake no mistake,\" he added. \u201cThe public may not embrace it, but they definitely support it. And this is actually his strongest area as he approaches his 100th day (in office).\u201d",
      "A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that immigration is a relative high point for Trump compared with other issues, including his approach to the economy, foreign policy and trade negotiations. Slightly fewer than half of U.S. adults, 46%, say they approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the issue, compared with his overall job approval rating of 39%, according to the survey.",
      "The poll was conducted April 17-21, a period that included a trip by Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., to El Salvador to demand that Kilmar Abrego Garcia be released from prison after the U.S. government admitted he was wrongly deported.",
      "In the 2020 election, few voters considered immigration the most important issue facing the country, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of registered voters in all 50 states.",
      "Four years later, after Republicans and conservative media had hammered Biden for his policies and often cast migrant U.S.-Mexico border crossings as an invasion, immigration had risen above health care, abortion and crime. It was second only to the economy.",
      "Under Biden, migrant apprehensions spiked to more than 2 million two years in a row. Republican governors in border states bused migrants by the tens of thousands to cities across the country, including to New York, where migrants were placed in shelters and hotels, straining budgets.",
      "Voters in the 2024 election were also more open to tougher immigration policies than the 2020 electorate. Last November, 44% of voters said most immigrants living in the United States illegally should be deported to their home countries, according to AP VoteCast, compared with 29% in 2020.",
      "Immigration remains a relative strength for Trump today: 84% of Republicans approve of Trump\u2019s immigration approach, according to the April AP-NORC poll, compared with 68% who approve of how he is handling trade negotiations.",
      "The poll found about 4 in 10 U.S. adults \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favor Trump\u2019s policy of sending Venezuelan immigrants who authorities say are gang members to El Salvador, with an additional 22% saying they neither favor nor oppose it. About 4 in 10 were opposed.",
      "Americans are more opposed, broadly, to revoking foreign students\u2019 visas over their participation in pro-Palestinian activism, with about half opposed and about 3 in 10 in support.",
      "The changing views are evident in places like northern New Jersey\u2019s suburban Passaic County, one of the former Democratic strongholds where Trump overperformed in November.",
      "Trump became the first Republican to win the county in more than 30 years. He carried the heavily Latino city of Passaic and significantly increased his support in Paterson, the state\u2019s third-largest city, which is majority Latino and also has a large Muslim community. He drew 13,819 votes after winning 3,999 in 2016. Having lost New Jersey by nearly 16 percentage points to Biden in 2020, Trump narrowed that margin to 6 percentage points last year.",
      "Paterson resident Sunny Cumur, 54, a truck driver who immigrated from Turkey in the late 1990s, describes himself as a Democrat who doesn\u2019t usually vote. But he wanted Trump to win, he said, because he was concerned about the border under Biden.",
      "While studies show immigrants are generally less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, local news in New York and other cities frequently featured what Trump took to calling \u201cmigrant crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat Biden did, they opened all the borders, and a lot of people come here for political asylum. Come on! They don't even check if they are terrorists or not,\" Cumur said. He complained that newcomers willing to work for lower wages have been undercutting workers like him.",
      "\u201cThrow \u2019em out. I don\u2019t want to live with criminals,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, other supporters worry Trump is taking things too far.",
      "Republican Manuel Terrero, 39, a real estate agent from Clifton, said he was drawn to Trump because of what felt like \u201cchaos\u201d under Biden, with too many people crossing the border and too much crime in neighboring New York.",
      "\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be allowed,\u201d said Terrero, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic.",
      "Trump \u201cis doing a lot of good things. And that is one of them, stopping the people that are coming here to create chaos. And the people that have criminal records, send them back. But I am against (deporting) the people that are working,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right way to do it.\"",
      "Rep. Nellie Pou, D-N.J., who was elected last year to represent the area in Congress, said her constituents believe strongly in border security but stand by her advocacy for immigrants. She recently joined Democrats on a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\u201cI do not want anyone that may be a danger to come to our country to harm any of our citizens. No one wants that. And I firmly believe that\u2019s what people in our district and across America want,\u201d she said. At the same time, she said, \u201cOur country was made of immigrants. ... So I believe there\u2019s a place for someone who comes in the legal ways.\u201d",
      "Trump burst onto the political scene in 2015 by labeling Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists and pledging to build \u201ca great wall.\u201d He spent much of his first term focused on the border.",
      "One of his first actions in office was to impose a travel ban barring the entry of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. That caused chaos at airports and protests across the nation. The policy was quickly blocked by the courts, forcing his administration to offer three broader iterations, the last of which was eventually upheld by the Supreme Court.",
      "The next flashpoint came in 2018, when border officials began separating families detained after illegally crossing the border. In some cases, children were forcibly removed from their parents under a \"zero tolerance\u201d policy, and the parents were sometimes deported without their kids.",
      "Images of children held in cages at border facilities and audio recordings of young children crying for their parents drew intense backlash, with thousands participating in hundreds of marches across the country. The protesters included soon-to-be Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was photographed in 2018 breaking down outside a facility in Texas being used to detain migrant children.",
      "Republicans joined in that condemnation.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott, R-Texas, called the separations \u201ctragic and heartrending\" in a letter that urged Congress to act. \u201cThis disgraceful condition must end,\" he wrote.",
      "\u201cAll Americans are rightly horrified by the images we are seeing on the news, children in tears pulled away from their mothers and fathers. This must stop,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. He introduced legislation mandating that apprehended families be kept together.",
      "Bowing to pressure and concerned about the impact on the upcoming midterm elections, Trump halted the policy.",
      "This time around, with border crossings down, Trump has shifted focus to expelling people already in the United States. He is expanding the limits of executive power and jousting with judges as he uses old laws and rarely used provisions to label hundreds of men gang members so they can be deported without being able to challenge their cases in court.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 who as a senator once tried to negotiate a bipartisan immigration package \u2014 has moved to expel people in the U.S. legally over political beliefs he deems counter to U.S. foreign policy interests.",
      "Their targets have included hundreds of students and others with legal status, including those on student visas or holding green cards conferring permanent residency, as well as those who have sought asylum using legal channels.",
      "Jorge Loweree, of the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit advocacy group, said Trump was doing something \u201cthat\u2019s wholly new in historical terms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s critical that people understand what the administration is doing,\u201d said Loweree, the council's managing director of programs and strategy. \u201cWe have an administration that believes they can disappear who they want, where they want, to anywhere they want.\u201d",
      "Loweree argued that even if voters in November rejected what they saw as chaos at the border, that \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they support these very draconian measures that are being implemented today.\u201d",
      "Few elected Republicans are speaking out, though some of Trump\u2019s outside allies have criticized what they see as overreach.",
      "Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host who endorsed Trump late in the campaign, voiced alarm at the case of Andry Hernandez Romero, a gay makeup artist from Venezuela with no criminal record who was among those sent to El Salvador's maximum-security CECOT prison.",
      "\u201cYou gotta get scared that people who are not criminals are getting like lassoed up and deported and sent to like El Salvador prisons,\u201d Rogan told his listeners. \u201cThat\u2019s horrific. And again, that\u2019s bad for the cause. Like the cause is let\u2019s get the gang members out. Everybody agrees. But let\u2019s not (have) innocent gay hairdressers get lumped up with the gangs.\u201d",
      "The April AP-NORC poll found that about half of Americans say Trump has \u201cgone too far\u201d when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, compared with about 6 in 10 who say he\u2019s \u201cgone too far\u201d on imposing new tariffs on other countries.",
      "It found Americans split on mass deportations, with about 4 in 10 in favor of deporting all immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and a similar share opposed. The percentage who support mass deportations is down slightly from an AP-NORC poll conducted in January, just before Trump took office.",
      "Still, about one-third of U.S. adults say Trump\u2019s actions have been \u201cabout right\u201d on immigration, and about 2 in 10 think he hasn't gone far enough.",
      "One case that has gained traction nationally is that of Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident from El Salvador who was sent to CECOT despite an immigration court order preventing his deportation. Trump officials have said that Abrego Garcia has ties to the MS-13 gang, a claim Abrego Garcia's attorneys deny, and noted that his wife once sought a protective order against him.",
      "El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, has said he will not let Abrego Garcia leave the country.",
      "More Democrats have traveled to El Salvador to highlight the case. And people angry about the situation have confronted Republican lawmakers, including at a contentious town hall Wednesday hosted by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, during which several members of the audience shouted at him to push for Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "The White House has embraced the fight. \u201cA request for Democrats \u2014 please continue to make defending criminal illegal immigrants your top messaging point,\u201d wrote Trump\u2019s director of communications, Steven Cheung.",
      "Some in the party have urged it to steer clear. Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., called the case a \u201cdistraction\u201d from issues such as tariffs that have emerged as a bigger weakness for Trump.",
      "\u201cThis is the debate (Republicans) want. This is their 80-20 issue, as they\u2019ve described it,\u201d he said of Republicans on his podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough case, because,\u201d he said, it risks people wondering, \u201care they defending MS-13?\u201d",
      "But Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, is urging Democrats to seize on the case. He says border issues are \u201cmuch more nuanced than \u2018immigration good for Trump, bad for Democrats'\" and believes that voters are on their side.",
      "\u201cIf we can't stand up against the illegal rendition of the father of a U.S. child to a prison known for torture, then I don\u2019t really know what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.",

Other documents include detainee complaints as well as an account of the arrival of 40 women at Krome, an all-male facility, in possible violation of a federal law to reduce the risk of prison rape.",
      "Nationwide, detentions have surged to nearly 48,000 as of March 23, a 21% increase from the already elevated levels at the end of the Biden administration.",
      "To address the shortage of capacity, ICE this month published a request for bids to operate detention centers for up to $45 billion as it seeks to expand to 100,000 beds from its current budget for about 41,000. As part of the build-out, the federal government, for the first time, is looking to hold migrants on U.S. Army bases.",
      "By some measures, Trump's controversial approach is working. Barely 11,000 migrants were encountered at the U.S.-Mexican border in March, their lowest level in at least a decade and down from 96,035 in December 2024, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "Krome is just one of five facilities that ICE directly runs and can house detainees for more than 16 hours. The vast majority of bed space is leased from local prisons, jails or privately-run facilities that have strict limits on how many detainees they are contractually obligated to accept.",
      "As its concrete cellblocks began filling up, federal workers started documenting the worsening conditions in weekly reports for DHS leadership. They worked their way up the chain through DHS\u2019 Office of Immigration & Detention Ombudsman, an independent watchdog established by Congress during the first Trump administration.",
      "In mid-March, the office\u2019s 100 staffers \u2014 including a case manager at Krome \u2014 were placed on administrative leave.",
      "\u201cRather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations,\u201d DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said at the time.",
      "Around the same time, Krome\u2019s chaos spilled into public view. Images secretly shot on a cellphone and posted on TikTok showed a group of men sleeping on concrete floors and under tables with little more than their shoes as pillows.",
      "\u201cWe are practically kidnapped,\u201d Osiris Vazquez, his eyes bloodshot due to a lack of sleep, said in the grainy video, which garnered 4.4 million views. \u201cWe don\u2019t want likes. We want help. Please!\u201d",
      "Vazquez said he shared a small room for two weeks with some 80 men. Showers and phone calls weren\u2019t allowed, the fetid-smelling bathrooms were left unattended and food was restricted to peanut butter sandwiches.",
      "\u201cYou lost all notion of time, whether it\u2019s day or night,\" recalled Vazquez in an interview after self-deporting to his native Mexico.",
      "It could\u2019ve been worse. Since Trump returned to the White House, three detainees have died in ICE custody \u2014 two of them at Krome.",
      "The latest, Maksym Chernyak, died after complaining to his wife about overcrowding and freezing conditions. The 44-year-old Ukrainian entered the U.S. last year under a humanitarian program for people fleeing the country\u2019s war with Russia.",
      "He was sent to Krome after an arrest for domestic violence and got sick with a chest cold. After being monitored for a week with high blood pressure, on Feb. 18, at 2:33 a.m., he was taken to a hospital for seizure-like vomiting. Two days later, he died.",
      "Other than acetaminophen, he received no medication to treat his blood pressure, according to a two-page ICE report about Chernyak\u2019s death. Chernyak\u2019s widow said that before her husband\u2019s detention, he was a \u201cstrong, healthy man.\u201d Without a translator, she said, her husband struggled to communicate.",
      "\u201cThey saw his condition, but they ignored him,\u201d said Oksana Tarasiuk in an interview. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t put in Krome, I\u2019m sure that he would still be alive.\u201d",
      "ICE, in a statement, didn\u2019t comment on specific allegations of mistreatment but said it adjusts its operations as needed to uphold its duty to treat individuals with dignity and respect.",
      "\u201cThese allegations are not in keeping with ICE policies, practices and standards of care,\u201d the agency said.",
      "Krome housed 740 men and one woman on March 31, according to the latest ICE data. That\u2019s up 31% from just before Trump took office. ICE refused to disclose Krome\u2019s current capacity because of security concerns.",

      "\u201cMy first inclination was to share that to people who have lost so much during this fire and our community in Altadena, because it\u2019s a sign of hope that nature\u2019s returning, that nature\u2019s resilient,\u201d said Kristen Ochoa, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, medical school leading the effort.",
      "Ochoa, a long-time resident of Southern California, first began documenting the plants and animals that live in the area known as the Chaney Trail Corridor in July 2024.

      "Much of the land was charred and barren after the fires, and the group also lost all of its cameras, watching as photos of the flames were transmitted before they went dark. But less than two months after the start of the fires, Ochoa was able to go back out and install new ones to start documenting the landscape's recovery.",
      "\u201cThe thing I really remember is coming here right after the fire \u2014 there was so much birdsong,\u201d Ochoa said.",
      "Many volunteers with the group are local residents who lost their homes and have told Ochoa that witnessing nature's recovery in the area has brought hope to them as well.",
      "While the fires burned aggressively, they also burned unevenly, leaving patches of trees and a small oasis of greenery surrounding a stream untouched. Animals were able to seek refuge there while the rest of their home burned.",
      "They have not come across any deceased animals, she said, but there were reports of an injured bear and deer.",
      "The heavy rain that came in the weeks after the fires have helped with a quick recovery.",
      "On a recent Wednesday morning, Ochoa pointed out several charred San Gabriel oak trees \u2014 only found in Southern California \u2014 that had rampant green growth around their base.",
      "The \u201ccrown sprouting\u201d comes from having deep and developed root systems that have helped the trees survive for hundreds of years, Ochoa said.",
      "An aggressive bloom of yellow mustard flowers, an invasive species, have also taken root on the hillsides, potentially crowding out native plants like the California sage brush and wild cucumber \u2014 a source of food for ground squirrels.",

      "The Trump administration plans to strictly require anyone illegally in the U.S. to register with the government and carry documentation",
      "PHOENIX -- The Trump administration's plan to strictly require anyone illegally in the U.S. to register with the government and carry documentation is stirring up fears of heightened racial profiling even among legal residents, immigrants' rights advocates say.",
      "For some, it's a return to a climate from the recent past in which police departments and other law enforcement agencies' insistence on documentation drove immigrants underground and increased public safety concerns.",
      "\u201cIt happens already to an extent. ... I think this would make it even worse because how would you know somebody is undocumented?\u201d said Jose Pati\u00f1o, vice president of education and external affairs for Aliento, an Arizona-based advocacy organization that supports immigrants without documents. \u201cIt creates ambiguity of how you\u2019re going to enforce and identify people who are not in the country (legally).\"",
      "A federal judge sided with President Donald Trump earlier this month in a lawsuit brought by immigrants' rights groups over the policy and the mandate took effect April 11. Trump officials say they are simply enforcing a requirement that has been law for decades.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws \u2014 we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce,\" U.S. Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem said in the statement after the ruling. \"We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.\u201d",
      "Under federal law, everyone 14 and older without legal status must self-register and give fingerprints and an address. Parents and guardians of anyone younger must ensure they are registered. Not doing so is considered a crime and a lack of documents risks prison time and fines.",
      "The mandate has rarely been enforced under previous administrations. To complicate matters, there have been recent instances of authorities detaining even people born in the U.S. as confusion also sweeps through other federal and state immigration policies.",
      "An online appointment app used by temporary residents has sent work permit cancellations since late March, including to U.S. citizens. A growing number of Republican-led states also are refusing to recognize state driver\u2019s licenses specially issued for immigrants without documents.",
      "Guerline Jozef, executive director of the nonprofit Haitian Bridge Alliance, says racial profiling already happens at a disproportionate rate to Black migrants. The sudden pivot has aggravated things and people with Temporary Protected Status or who had regular Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-ins have been detained during travel, she said.",
      "She decried the whole ordeal as a form of \u201cpsychological warfare.\" Migrants who were allowed temporary legal residence are not sure if they need to protectively carry documents at all times.",
      "\u201cIt is very hard to even communicate with the community members on what to do, telling them they need to know their rights, but they trample on their rights anyway,\u201d Jozef said. \u201cWe are back in the \u2018show me your papers\u2019 era.\u201d",
      "The new mandate evokes previous instances of certain groups having to carry documentation. During the time of enslavement in the U.S., freed Black people had to have \u201cfreedom papers\u201d or risk being re-enslaved. During World War II, Japanese Americans were required to register and keep identification cards but were put in incarceration camps.",
      "\u201cThe statutes that are on the books about registration have been dormant\" for 85 years, said Lynn Marcus, director of immigration law clinics at the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law. \u201cThere weren't forms to comply with this requirement. It was created in wartime originally.\u201d",
      "The renewed strict registration requirement forces U.S. citizens to carry birth certificates or other proof of citizenship at all times, \u201cespecially if they have a \u2018foreign appearance,'\" Marcus said.",
      "People who are valid residents or visa holders could potentially be profiled based on factors other than physical characteristics.",
      "\u201cLet's say law enforcement encounters someone in another circumstance \u2014 maybe they're reporting a crime,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cThey might not be satisfied with answers if they aren't able to communicate because not all U.S. citizens speak fluent English.\u201d",
      "Eileen Diaz McConnell, a professor at Arizona State University's School of Transborder Studies, pointed to the effects of a 2010 Arizona law requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers.",
      "In 2012, the Justice Department sued the state over the law and the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the papers requirement, but those two years when the requirement was in place were a traumatic time for Latino families in the state, McConnell said.",
      "\u201cParents wouldn\u2019t ride together in a car. They were always separated because they were worried they would be stopped,\u201d Diaz McConnell said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t leave their house.\u201d",
      "She has done extensive research on how immigration policies can impact the mental health of mixed households of family members who are American-born and don't have documents.",
      "\u201cIn previous years, children report, even if they\u2019re U.S.-born, real harm \u2014 impacts on their own sleep, worry, not eating, depression,\u201d Diaz McConnell said. \u201cThere will be people who will say things like, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re not undocumented, what do you have to worry about?\u2019\"",
      "Pati\u00f1o, whose undocumented parents brought him to the U.S. when he was 6, is accustomed to keeping papers as a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient. He knows others without special status are now panicked. The single mother of one of his U.S.-born former interns has stopped going to the grocery store, church and other places since she lacks documents.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like she\u2019s afraid of her shadow or, like, even to go out and throw out the trash,\u201d he said.",
      "People who crossed the border without documents are especially unsure whether to register in the wake of international students and others being detained or deported even though they had visas or pending court hearings.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re asking people to come out of the shadows and enroll us in a system that most of them probably have not heard of,\u201d Pati\u00f1o said. \u201cIt seems the administration is trying to go catch-22 with folks. You are in trouble if you do, you\u2019re in trouble if you don\u2019t.\u201d",

      "Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in less than six weeks",
      "WASHINGTON -- Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in less than six weeks, a loss of aircraft worth more than $200 million in what is becoming the most dramatic cost to the Pentagon of the military campaign against the Iran-backed militants.",
      "According to defense officials, three of the drones were shot down in the past week \u2014 suggesting the militants' targeting of the unmanned aircraft flying over Yemen has improved. The drones were doing attack runs or conducting surveillance, and they crashed both into the water and onto land, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.",
      "The U.S. has increased its attacks on the Houthis, launching daily strikes since March 15, when President Donald Trump ordered a new, expanded campaign. He promised to use \u201coverwhelming lethal force\u201d until the Houthis cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.",
      "Central Command spokesman Dave Eastburn said Thursday night that the U.S. has struck more than 800 Houthi targets. \u201cThese strikes have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, advanced weapons storage locations, and killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders,\u201d Eastburn said.",
      "Another defense official said that although hostile fire is likely the cause of the drone losses, the incidents are still under investigation. The official noted that the increase in U.S. strikes can add to the risk to aircraft, but said the U.S. will take every measure possible to protect troops, equipment and interests in the region. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to comment on sensitive military issues.",
      "The sophisticated drones, built by General Atomics, cost about $30 million each, and generally fly at altitudes of more than 40,000 feet (12,100 meters). Houthis leaders have consistently touted the strikes in public statements. One of the defense officials said the U.S. lost Reaper drones on March 31 and on April 3, 9, 13, 18, 19 and 22.",
      "U.S. senators, meanwhile, are raising concerns about civilian casualties caused by the American strikes in Yemen. Democratic Sens. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tim Kaine of Virginia wrote to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Thursday questioning whether the Trump administration is \u201cabandoning the measures necessary to meet its obligations to reducing civilian harm.\u201d",
      "Specifically, they questioned reports that U.S. strikes at the Ras Isa fuel terminal in Yemen last week potentially killed more than 70 civilians.",
      "\u201cMilitary leaders agree that ingraining civilian harm mitigation practices within U.S operations leads to better outcomes and that civilian casualties actually undermine the mission that the military has been sent in to do,\u201d their letter said.",
      "In addition to downing the drones, the Houthis have been persistently firing missiles and one-way attack drones at U.S. military ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. They haven't hit any.",
      "The U.S. has been using an array of warships, fighter jets, bombers and drones to strike the Houthis, and aircraft can now launch from two Navy carriers in the region.",
      "Hegseth decided in March to beef up the Navy warship presence in the Middle East, ordering the USS Harry S. Truman to extend its deployment there, as the USS Carl Vinson steamed toward the area.",
      "The Truman, along with two of the destroyers and a cruiser in its strike group, is now in the Red Sea. And the Vinson, along with two destroyers and a cruiser, is in the Gulf of Aden.",
      "The third destroyer assigned to the Truman is in the Mediterranean Sea. And two other U.S. Navy destroyers are in the Red Sea, but aren't part of the Truman's group.",
      "Hegseth is weighing whether to grant a request by U.S. Central Command to once again extend the Truman's deployment. A decision to do that could keep the Truman and at least some of its strike group in the region for several more weeks.",
      "It has been rare in recent years for the U.S. to have two aircraft carriers in the Middle East at the same time.

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas lawmakers on Thursday passed a $1 billion education bill that allows families to use public money to pay for private school tuition, a major victory for school voucher proponents nationwide that was cheered on by President Donald Trump.",
      "The measure won final approval from the state Senate and now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who had muscled the GOP-majority Legislature to pass the bill and has vowed to quickly sign it into law.",
      "More than 30 states have implemented some sort of voucher program in the U.S., and about a dozen states in recent years have launched or expanded programs that make most students eligible. Texas' version will be among the largest in the nation and is seen as a major victory for proponents who hope to push a similar effort on the federal level.",
      "\"School choice has come to Texas,\u201d said Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican who controls the Senate who has pushed for a voucher program for nearly 20 years.",
      "For decades, the push in Texas had failed in the face of stiff resistance from Democrats and rural Republicans who called it a threat to public schools in a state that now has more than 5 million students in public classrooms.",
      "But supporters gradually gained ground and Abbott, a three-term governor, threw his political muscle behind it in the 2024 elections by backing numerous candidates who would support it. That effort built the majority support the issue needed after decades of failure.",
      "Trump played a key role in getting the measure through a critical state House vote a week ago, when he spoke with a group of Republican lawmakers on a speakerphone call and urged them to approve it.",
      "The program in its first year would be capped at $1 billion and used by up to 90,000 students, but it could grow to nearly $4.5 billion per year by 2030. The money can be used for private school tuition or costs for home-schooling and virtual learning programs. Families could get up to $10,000 each year per student under the program, and a student with disabilities would be eligible for as much as $30,000 per year.",
      "Supporters of the measure say the vouchers can help parents get their children out of poor-performing public schools and create competition that will force public schools to improve.",
      "\u201cThe one thing that is missing from our education process that has really made America great is competition,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Bob Hall.",
      "Critics, however, argue it will weaken public schools by draining money and resources and giving them to private schools, who can have selective enrollment and may not operate under some of the same rules.",
      "And they argue it will put money in the pocket of wealthier families already sending their children to costly private schools.",
      "The bill is \u201cnot about \u2018school choice,\u2019\u201d the Senate Democratic caucus said in a statement. \u201cIt's about public subsidization of private schools' choice. It's a step backwards for Texas.\u201d",
      "The issue is not settled among Republicans nationwide. On Monday, North Dakota's Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong vetoed a private school voucher program in that state, saying the bill fell \u201cfar short of truly expanding choice as it only impacts one sector of our student population.\u201d",

      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- State lawmakers across the U.S. have introduced at least 240 anti-China proposals this year, aiming to ensure public funds don't buy Chinese technology or even T-shirts, coffee mugs and key chains for tourists. They're also targeting sister-city relationships between American and Chinese communities.",
      "After years celebrating trade ties with China, states don't want police to buy Chinese drones, government agencies to use Chinese apps, software or parts, or public pension systems to invest in Chinese companies. A new Kansas law covers artificial intelligence and medical equipment, while in Arkansas, the targets include sister-city ties and state and local contracts for promotional items. Tennessee now prohibits health insurance coverage for organ transplants performed in China or with organs from China.",

      "Kansas House Majority Leader Chris Croft, a retired Army colonel, said countering China is a \u201cjoint effort\u201d for states and the U.S. government. He championed a new law greatly limiting property ownership within 100 miles (160 kilometers) of a military installation in Kansas by firms and people tied to foreign adversaries \u2014 China, but also Cuba, Iran and North Korea.",
      "\u201cAll of us have a part to play,\u201d Croft said.",
      "Further limiting foreign property ownership remains popular, with at least 46 proposals in 24 states, but critics liken imposing restrictions to selling snow shovels to Miami residents.",

Chinese interests\u2019 share was about 277,000 acres, or two-hundredths of 1%.",
      "And in Arkansas, only the state capital of Little Rock is affected by the ban on sister-city relationships.",

      "Much of the recent market volatility is because of uncertainty about what Trump will do with his economic policies. Adding to some relief was Trump saying late Tuesday that he has \u201cno intention\u201d to fire the head of the Federal Reserve.",
      "Trump\u2019s tough talk had frightened investors because the Fed is supposed to act independently, without pressure from politicians, so that it can make decisions that may be painful in the short term but are best for the long term.",
      "While a cut to interest rates by the Fed could give the economy a boost, it could also put upward pressure on inflation. Trump also said U.S. tariffs on imports coming from China could come down \u201csubstantially\u201d from the current 145%.",

      "\u201cThere is an opportunity for a big deal here,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday.",
      "All the uncertainty means one of the few predictions many along Wall Street are willing to make is that sharp swings for financial markets will continue for a while. The market will \u201cmore likely than not continue to be dictated by Trump\u2019s latest whims regarding tariffs and trade,\u201d said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.",
      "The S&P 500 remains 12.5% below its record set earlier this year after briefly dropping roughly 20% below the mark. Its swings have been coming not just day to day but also hour to hour as Trump and his administration\u2019s officials continue to surprise markets.",
      "Trump\u2019s latest comments had a relaxing effect on the bond market, where Treasury yields eased. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.38% from 4.41% late Tuesday. It dropped as low as 4.26% earlier in the morning.",
      "Big Tech helped lead indexes higher. Nvidia rose 3.9% to claw back more of the sharp losses it took last week, when it said U.S. restrictions on exports of its H20 chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion.

      "\u201cPresident Trump is excited to return to the great state of Michigan next Tuesday, where he will rally in Macomb County to celebrate the FIRST 100 DAYS!\u201d Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday on social media.",
      "The rally will take place one day before Trump\u2019s 100th day in office \u2014 a traditional early milestone in which a president's progress is measured against campaign promises. Michigan was one of the key battleground states Trump flipped last year from Democrats on his path back to the White House.",
      "Trump has not traveled much since taking office outside of personal weekend trips. His only other official trip in his second term was during the first week, when he visited disaster zones in North Carolina and California and held an event in Las Vegas to promote his plan to eliminate taxes on tips.",
      "But later this week, Trump will travel to Pope Francis' funeral in Rome, the first foreign trip in his second term.",
      "Trump\u2019s upcoming trip to Michigan follows a series of meetings and phone calls with the state\u2019s high-profile Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer. Once a sharp critic of Trump, Whitmer has said that she hopes to find common ground with the president in his second term.",
      "A key area of potential cooperation that Whitmer has pointed to is Selfridge Air National Guard Base, long a concern for Whitmer and Michigan lawmakers amid uncertainty over its future as the A-10 aircraft stationed there are phased out. The base is located in Macomb County, where he is set to appear Tuesday.",

    "story": [
      "The judge overseeing the sprawling $2.8 billion antitrust lawsuit settlement involving the NCAA and the nation\u2019s five largest conferences has delayed final approval of the plan until it is modified to address concerns about roster limits",
      "The judge overseeing the rewriting of the college sports rulebook threw a potentially deal-wrecking roadblock into the mix Wednesday, insisting parties in the $2.8 billion antitrust lawsuit redo the part of the proposed settlement involving roster limits that many schools are already putting in motion.",
      "\u201cAny disruption that may occur is a problem of Defendants\u2019 and NCAA members schools\u2019 own making,\u201d U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken wrote in a pointed five-page order in which she gave no weight to the argument that a reworking of the proposal could throw college sports into chaos.",
      "She gave the sides 14 days to contact their mediator and return to the bargaining table.",
      "The settlement in the landmark class-action lawsuit called for schools to no longer be bound by scholarship limits for their teams, but rather by roster limits in which everyone would be eligible for aid.",
      "It figured to ultimately weed out walk-ons, athletes on partial scholarships and, in extreme cases, entire teams. In preparing for the settlement to be approved, schools across the country have been busy cutting players who, in turn, were finding spots on new teams.",
      "Attorneys argued that undoing all those moves would add even more turbulence to an already tumultuous landscape.",
      "Not her problem, Wilken said, in insisting both sides jumped the gun in making the moves.",
      "\"The fact that the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreement should not have been interpreted as an indication that it was certain that the Court would grant final approval,\" Wilken said of the preliminary nod she gave back in October that set these transactions in motion.",
      "While the attorneys look for a Plan B, the clock is ticking. Terms of the settlement were supposed to go into effect July 1. Football practice starts soon after. Whether rosters will come in at around the old average (128) or the newly prescribed limit (105) is an open question.",
      "One of the plaintiff attorneys, working virtually in lockstep with the NCAA and conferences since this settlement was (all but) locked in, released a daunting statement.",
      "\u201cWe will work hard to convince the NCAA and the conferences to address the court\u2019s concerns,\u201d Steve Berman said. \u201cIf we are unable to do so, then we are off to trial and we will return to fighting the NCAA in court with next steps.\u201d",
      "The NCAA and five defendant conferences released a joint statement saying they were closely reviewing the order.",
      "\u201cOur focus continues to be on securing approval of this significant agreement, which aims to create more opportunities than ever before for student-athletes while fostering much-needed stability and fairness in college sports,\u201d it said.",
      "Steven Molo, an attorney who represented more than 190 athletes at Wilken's hearing earlier this month, viewed the order as a victory of sorts.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re grateful the court understood the pain the proposed settlement has been inflicting on many student-athletes who\u2019ve dedicated themselves to their sports,\u201d Molo said. \u201cThe tremendous unfairness of the arbitrary roster limits must be addressed.\"",
      "As for the rest of the settlement \u2014 including the $2.8 billion in back damages and the $20.5 million many schools can dole out to their athletes \u2014 Wilken said she's ready to go.",
      "But this has been portrayed all along as an all-or-nothing deal, and though it was a mere matter of routine, Wilken's release of a pretrial schedule \u2014 with some hearings scheduled out through September \u2014underscored the idea that, indeed, there's at least a chance this lawsuit could be resolved with a trial.",
      "Not that any of this should have surprised the attorneys.",
      "Wilken made clear toward the end of the daylong settlement hearing April 7 that she would like the parties to find a way to gradually implement the roster-limit rules. She suggested \u201cgrandfathering in\" athletes who already had roster spots. In her order Wednesday, she insisted that wasn't as impossible as the attorneys made it sound.",
      "\u201cOne way of achieving that could be to modify the settlement agreement to ensure that no (athletes) who have or had a roster spot will lose it as a result of the immediate implementation of the settlement agreement,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLimits could be accomplished gradually by attrition.\u201d",
      "Wilken also rejected attorneys' arguments that, essentially, the good being done for thousands of athletes who can now get paid (and who might have a previously unavailable shot at a scholarship) offsets whatever damage takes place to the players who find themselves at new schools \u2014 or no school at all.",
      "\u201cThe Court can approve the settlement agreement only if it is fair, reasonable, and adequate after considering, in relevant part, whether it 'treats class members equitably relative to each other,'\u201d Wilken wrote, in quoting a previous ruling.",
      "It is not clear how many roster spots across hundreds of schools will vanish under the settlement, though some estimates have pegged the number in the thousands.",
      "What is sure is that this ruling shoves the schools' attempts at getting ready for 2025-26 a step deeper into a black hole of uncertainty. Also clear: the judge is every bit as concerned about the hundreds of athletes losing roster spots as she is with the multibillion-dollar industry they inhabit.",

      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- A federal judge on Wednesday found the state of North Dakota entitled to nearly $28 million for responding to protests of the Dakota Access oil pipeline in 2016 and 2017 \u2014 a win for the state in its multiyear effort to recoup the costs from the federal government.",
      "The state filed the lawsuit in 2019, seeking $38 million for policing the protests. The sometimes-chaotic demonstrations drew international attention for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\u2019s opposition to the pipeline\u2019s Missouri River crossing upstream of the tribe\u2019s reservation. The tribe has long opposed the pipeline, fearing an oil spill polluting its water supply.",
      "A trial played out over several weeks in early 2024 in federal court in Bismarck, the state capital. People who testified included former North Dakota governors Doug Burgum, who took office in December 2016 during the protests\u2019 height, and Jack Dalrymple, whose administration responded to the protests\u2019 early months.",
      "U.S. District Judge Daniel Traynor found the United States liable to the state on all claims and for more than $27.8 million in damages.",
      "The judge wrote: \u201cThe bottom line: United States had a mandatory procedure, it did not follow that procedure, and harm occurred to the state of North Dakota. The law allows reimbursement for this harm. More than that, the rule of law requires this Court to hold the United States liable to remind it of its role in the larger picture of ensuring peace, not chaos.\u201d",
      "Thousands of people camped and demonstrated against the pipeline near the crossing for months, resulting in hundreds of arrests. Sometimes-violent clashes occurred between protesters and law enforcement officers. Law enforcement officers from around the state and region responded to the protests.",
      "The protest camps were cleared in February 2017. An attorney for the state said the protests ended in a response of more than seven months involving 178 agencies, resulting in 761 arrests and requiring four days of cleanup of the camp to remove millions of pounds of trash.",
      "In a joint statement, Gov. Kelly Armstrong and Attorney General Drew Wrigley said: \u201cAs outlined in trial testimony and Judge Traynor\u2019s ruling, decisions made by the Obama administration emboldened protestors and ultimately caused millions of dollars in damage to North Dakota, while endangering the health and safety of North Dakota communities, families and law enforcement officers who responded to the protests.\u201d",
      "The state's claims included negligence, gross negligence, civil trespass and public nuisance.",
      "Attorneys for the government said at trial that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials \u201cacted reasonably given limited options at their disposal\u201d during the protests, and that the state's claim is \u201cgreatly overstated.\" The government asked the judge to find a lack of legal jurisdiction for the state's claims, that the state hasn't proven its claims and is not entitled to damages.",
      "The Associated Press sent an email to an attorney who argued for the federal government at trial seeking comment.",
      "The pipeline has been transporting oil since June 2017. Many state government officials and industry leaders support the pipeline as crucial infrastructure in the country\u2019s No. 3 oil-producing state. The pipeline carries roughly 5% of the United States' daily oil production.",
      "In 2017, the pipeline company, Energy Transfer, donated $15 million to help cover the response costs. That same year, the U.S. Justice Department gave a $10 million grant to the state for reimbursing the response. The judge found the former to be a gift and reduced the latter from the state's total recovery.",
      "Then-President Donald Trump denied a 2017 request from the state for the federal government to cover the costs through a disaster declaration.",
      "The pipeline is operating while a court-ordered environmental review of the river crossing is carried out.",
      "A North Dakota jury recently found Greenpeace liable for defamation and other claims brought by the pipeline's builder in connection with protest activities, with damages surpassing $660 million against three Greenpeace organizations.",

      "Kerry is one of 50,000 UK hairdressing professionals represented by the British Hair Consortium (BHC), which has urged Rachel Reeves to take action or face the \"collapse\" of the industry due to rising costs.",
      "The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs.",
      "The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market.",
      "Kerry's case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament's Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector.",
      "Lopez,  the MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, said Kerry was not alone in being forced to consider whether she will have to shut up shop completely.",
      "\"Some the increased bills for salons are just unbelievable,\" she said, adding that women were disproportionately impacted by the changes.",
      "\"It's hard to ignore the impact, let alone the irony, of a chancellor celebrating herself for being the first woman to hold that office while simultaneously hammering the sectors that employ, serve and are often led, by women.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Gibson agreed that Reeves' Budget had implemented \"an unfair tax on jobs\" and the government must offer tax relief for small businesses in June.",
      "Gibson said an increasing number of salons are opting to rent chairs out to self-employed staff, instead of employing stylists directly, to avoid paying tax.",
      "\"If salons don't get support we will see a huge increase in people becoming chair renters,\" she said, which reduces the Treasury's overall tax take.",
      "Responding for the Labour government, Small Business Minister Gareth Thomas defended the chancellor's decisions in her October Budget as \"important for long term stability\".",
      "Salons are \"a vital pillar of our high streets\", he said, adding \"many hair and beauty businesses will benefit from some of the other measures the chancellor introduced\".",
      "\"We increased the employment allowance so that almost one million employers pay no national insurance contributions at all.",
      "More than half of employers will see no change or gain from that package, and that includes many hair and beauty businesses,\" he told MPs.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20lyg4385o",
    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 16:07:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The US central bank is one of Trump's favourite punching bags. But how serious is the threat?",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has some well-known nemeses: illegal immigrants, low-flow showers and last, but definitely not least, the head of the US central bank.",
      "Elevated by Trump to lead the Federal Reserve starting in 2018, Jerome Powell almost immediately found himself under fire - described on social media as a bonehead and questioned about reports that the president wanted him gone.",
      "But however uncomfortable Powell might have been then, his position has only gotten worse.",
      "Not only is he overseeing an economy where the risk of recession is rapidly rising, Trump has been flirting publicly with his removal, writing on social media last week: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"",
      "Coming at a time when Trump has pushed to expand presidential power, while cowing political opponents and ploughing past judicial efforts to check his action, it has raised alarm that he is more serious about, and might be more able to, exert control over the Fed than during his first term.",
      "The tensions cooled this week, when Trump, a day after a market slide that some analysts tied to the comments, denied to reporters that he ever had any intention of firing Powell.",
      "It came amid other hints of de-escalation in Trump's economic rhetoric as his policies, especially trade tariffs, have faced rising political and business backlash.",
      "But Trump did not offer much assurance that he would limit his interventions at the Fed, maintaining his right to have a view and noting that he might call Powell to discuss his concerns about the bank's interest rate policy.",
      "Donald Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, said the shift in tone appeared intended to calm financial markets but he did not think it marked the end of a fight over the Fed, an institution considered vital to the health of the world's largest economy.",
      "\"It's a testimony to the market's response,\" he said. \"But I think it's way too soon to say that there's a stability there.\"",
      "What is Trump's problem with Powell?",
      "Trump's clash with the Fed is ostensibly rooted in differences over where the bank should fix its key interest rate, which plays an influential role shaping borrowing costs for credit cards, mortgages and other loans.",
      "Lower rates make it easier to borrow and tend to deliver an economic boost. Higher interest rates dampen activity, helping to keep prices stable.",
      "Trump, who cut his teeth professionally taking out loans as a property developer, has long confessed to liking a low interest rate policy.",
      "He objected when the Fed raised rates in his first term and has been pushing Powell to cut them now, arguing that inflation has cooled and keeping rates too high could do unnecessary economic damage.",
      "\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote on social media earlier this week, referring to Powell.",
      "A threat to Fed independence?",
      "Trump is hardly the first politician to cast the bank as a scapegoat at a moment of economic turmoil - or to press for lower interest rates.",
      "Nor is he alone in his criticism of Powell, who infamously initially dismissed post-pandemic price inflation as \"transitory\" and has been faulted for being too focused on backward-looking data.",
      "Trump's pressure on the bank, however, breaks with Washington tradition in recent decades of presidential deference to the Fed.",
      "It has drawn comparisons to former President Richard Nixon, who pushed his Fed chairman to loosen its policies ahead of the 1972 election, moves later blamed for feeding the high-inflation, low-growth \"stagflationary\" dynamic of that decade.",
      "The idea that Trump could exert control over the Fed elicits horror among many economists, who say history is littered with examples of countries where political interference at central banks led to spiralling prices and economic ruin.",
      "Sarah Binder, professor at George Washington University and a scholar of the Federal Reserve, said confidence in Fed independence is key to maintaining market faith that inflation will be controlled.",
      "If shaken, it could lead to higher borrowing costs for everyone, as investors demand higher interest rates for holding debt, she warned, noting that should the Fed eventually cut rates, it is likely to spark speculation about Trump's influence - regardless of how, if at all, it played into the decision.",
      "\"That's ultimately the problem. It is perceptions of independence that really matter and that's what the pernicious effects of the attacks are they do raise doubts about whether the Fed can be as stalwart as central bankers want to be,\" she said.",
      "Can Trump fire Powell?",
      "Joe Lavorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, who served on the National Economic Council during Trump's first term, said he saw little need for Trump to dial back his attacks, noting that he was making a \"very classic macro argument\" about the bank's flaws.",
      "\"I'm completely on board with the president's sympathies or comments that the Fed has historically been late,\" he said, adding that he thought stock market falls had been driven primarily by questions about trade policy.",
      "He said he believed that Fed officials would remain more responsive to financial conditions than the president, noting that, if anything, Trump's pressure could make it more hesitant to cut, lest it be perceived as being cowed.",
      "\"Ultimately the Fed is going to do what's prudent,\" he said. \"The question is just the timing.\"",
      "Powell, a longtime Washington lawyer whose term as chair is due to end next year, has maintained that he is unbothered - and uninfluenced - by the criticism and asserted that Trump does not have the legal authority to remove him.",
      "But the strength of his position is a matter of legal debate.",
      "By law, Fed governors can only be removed for cause, but it is unclear whether that protection extends to the role leading the board.",
      "The administration has already taken steps to reduce the Fed's regulatory role and is engaged in a legal battle over expanding presidential authority over other government agencies set up with features, like for cause protections, intended to insulate them from partisan pressure.",
      "Mark Spindel, founder and chief investment officer of the Washington-based investment advisory firm Potomac River Capital, who has worked with Prof Binder on Fed studies, noted that the tradition of Fed \"independence\" had evolved over time, often after political or economic crisis.",
      "\"Things that are given can be taken away,\" he said, hours before Trump appeared to back off.",
      "Asked again for his thoughts a few days later, Mr Spindel wrote back just two words in reply: \"Damage done.\""

    "summary": "The forecast fall in the cost of energy would reverse three consecutive increases in the price cap.",
    "story": [
      "Domestic energy prices are forecast to fall in July, reversing three consecutive increases in regulator Ofgem's price cap.",
      "The annual bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by \u00a3166 a year, a drop of nearly 9%, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted.",
      "It comes after a series of household bills became more expensive in April, and would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost \u00a31,683.",
      "The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill - so if you use more, you pay more.",
      "Huge uncertainty",
      "The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by Ofgem.",
      "While the quarterly change can skew annual comparisons, the regulator illustrates the effect of the price cap with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.",
      "In the three months from July last year, that typical bill stood at \u00a31,568 a year. It rose on each of the three occasions the cap was set after that, the most recent of which was at the start of April.",
      "The predicted fall of almost 9% in July - if it happens - would bring it sharply down to the lowest level since last September.",
      "Cornwall Insight also expects a slight fall in prices in October and another drop in January 2026.",
      "However, analysts said great uncertainty still surrounded these forecasts.",
      "\"While a fall in bills will always be welcomed by households, we mustn't get ahead of ourselves. We have all seen markets go up as fast as they go down, and the very fact the market dropped so quickly shows how vulnerable it is to geopolitical and market shifts,\" said Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, which is widely recognised for the accuracy of its predictions.",
      "\"There is unfortunately no guarantee that any fall in prices will be sustained.",
      "\"The only real way to protect households from this constant cycle of instability and insecurity is to reduce our dependence on international wholesale markets.\"",
      "The fall in the wholesale cost of energy, paid by suppliers, is behind the latest predictions.",
      "That has been affected by US tariffs policy and warmer-than-expected weather in Europe."

      "\"Gift cards, e-gift cards and credit receipts can't currently be used as a payment method in store or online,\" it said in response to one person on X.",

    "story": [
      "It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot.",
      "I have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows.",
      "Standing at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral.",
      "Today the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager.",
      "He explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions.",
      "Passers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room.",
      "They reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease.",
      "Unitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form.",
      "The potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises.",
      "It could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher.",
      "But the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe.",
      "Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem.",
      "To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous.",
      "So much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine.",
      "\"The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,\" a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC.",
      "\"Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning \u2013 such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way \u2013 a challenge,\" they said.",
      "At the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development.",
      "For now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories.",
      "The highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. In January he said that \"several thousand\" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing \"useful things\" in Tesla factories.",
      "Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.",
      "Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.",
      "Mr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market.",
      "\"The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],\" he says.",
      "Unitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (\u00a312,500).",
      "Also, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations.",
      "In a recent report STIQ notes that almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest.",
      "Chinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government.",
      "For example, in Shanghai there is a state-backed training facility for robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks.",

      "Bristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot.",

      "\"The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place.",
      "\"So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia.\"",
      "As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form.",
      "Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs.",
      "\"All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?\" he asks.",
      "Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter.",
      "\"My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,\" he says.",
      "Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real \"secret sauce\" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans.",
      "\"A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it.",
      "\"What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,\" Mr Pierce says.",
      "He says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times.",

      "So will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off.",
      "\"My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task,\" says Mr Pierce.",

      "\"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"Obviously I've been meeting Scott Bessent this week whilst I'm in Washington, but I've also this week met the French, the German, the Spanish, the Polish, the Swedish, the Finnish finance ministers - because it is so important that we rebuild those trading relationships with our nearest neighbours in Europe, and we're going to do that in a way that is good for British jobs and British consumers.\"",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the chancellor's remarks had been \"a statement of fact that the EU is our largest trading partner\".",
      "The spokesman also highlighted comments that Sir Keir Starmer has made previously where he had said it was a \"false choice between the EU and the US\".",
      "UK could lower US car tariffs in push for trade deal",
      "Three more UK interest rate cuts this year, predicts IMF",

      "She has said she wants to see \"free and fair\" trade, and wants to deepen the relationship between the US and UK in areas such as technology.",
      "Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith told Sky News that his party would \"absolutely be seeking to prioritise\" a deal with the US over the EU.",
      "Griffith argued that the UK already had a tariff-free deal on goods with the EU, therefore the \"next best choice if you want to grow the economy after the chancellor's crashed it would be to get a deal with the US\".",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP said: \"The chancellor is absolutely right that our trading relationship with Europe is more important, but the government's approach so far shows these are little more than empty words.",
      "\"This government has bent over backwards to appease Donald Trump but barely lifted a finger to unleash growth by boosting trade with Europe.\"",
      "'We're all grappling with tariffs'",
      "Regarding the situation with the US, Reeves said she \"understands what President [Donald] Trump wants to address\" with his tariffs, ahead of talks with her US counterpart in Washington.",
      "Reeves said there were similarities with the way both the US and UK governments had come to power off the back of voter frustration with the economy.",
      "\"We're all grappling with this issue of tariffs but I think that there is an understanding why President Trump wants to address some of the global imbalances there are in the system,\" she said.",
      "Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US including from the UK.",
      "The UK also faces a broader tariff rate of 10% and is looking to negotiate an agreement with the US administration, along with dozens of other countries hit with even higher levies \u2013 most of which are currently on pause until July.",
      "Some US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.",
      "Reeves said she had also been working closely with European and Canadian counterparts to remove trade barriers, and that conversations around the table at G20 meetings this week had been difficult.",
      "\"Obviously there are strains. We are all following what's happening in our domestic bond markets, in our equity markets, and we all know that that uncertainty is bad for investment in the UK economy.\"",

    "summary": "Not owning crucial code has meant it has been unable to replace the system that led to a scandal.",
    "story": [
      "The Post Office has paid more than \u00a3600m of public money to continue using the faulty Horizon IT system despite deciding to ditch it more than a decade ago, the BBC can reveal.",
      "The terms of the original 1999 deal with computer giant Fujitsu mean the Post Office has been stuck with the system and unable to build a replacement so far, even after it contributed to one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice.",
      "Former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair and other senior Labour government figures were warned about potential problems with the terms of the deal before it was signed, the BBC has learned.",
      "The Post Office said it \"apologises unreservedly to victims of the Horizon IT scandal\" and said it was committed to moving away from Fujitsu and the Horizon software.",
      "Under the terms of the original \u00a3548m deal, struck under pressure from the then-Labour government, the Post Office did not own the computer code for the core part of the Horizon system.",
      "Although the Post Office has wanted to switch suppliers since 2012, buying the rights to the code from Fujitsu or building a completely new system from scratch was considered too expensive - even as the amounts paid to Fujitsu to retain the Horizon system grew and grew.",
      "Because it did not own the code, the Post Office was also unable to inspect the part of the software that processed transactions, and had to rely on assurances from Fujitsu that it was functioning correctly.",
      "The Post Office, which is owned by the government, prosecuted about 700 sub-postmasters between 1999 and 2015 for theft, fraud and false accounting over supposed cash shortfalls in branches reported by the Horizon system, based on these assurances. The convictions were overturned by Parliament last year.",
      "Earlier this year, Business Minister Baroness Jones of Whitchurch told the House of Lords that the Post Office is \"unfortunately, still dependent on the Horizon system\", and the only way Fujitsu could be \"out of the picture\" immediately would mean shutting down all local post offices.",
      "An attempt to replace the system with one built by IBM failed in 2016, at a cost of \u00a340m, and the Post Office extended its contract with Fujitsu for at least four more years at a cost of \u00a3107m.",
      "The Post Office told the BBC that it finally obtained rights related to the Horizon software and code in 2023, although it is not known if this includes the core system that processes transactions.",
      "The \u00a310m price for the licence was \"cheap - because who else would buy it?\" according to IT expert Jason Coyne, one of the first people to identify flaws in the system.",
      "The BBC understands that the Post Office may try to use this licence for Horizon's replacement. But while this is being built,  IT experts believe the Post Office's contract with Fujitsu will need to be extended beyond March 2026 - when it is currently due to end.",
      "Issues over who would own the Horizon software began when the contract to computerise the network of Post Office branches - then numbering 18,000 - was negotiated between the Post Office, Fujitsu and its subsidiary ICL Pathway, and the government.",
      "In May 1999, Sir Tony Blair received an update from the Treasury, in a document warning that discussions with ICL over the terms of a deal \"have foundered\".",
      "One of the sticking points was around intellectual property rights (IPR) - which included ownership of the code within the Horizon software.",
      "The document says that ICL was \"not prepared to... give perpetual licences for all the IPR\".",
      "It goes on to say that if the Post Office ever wanted to change suppliers, the owner of the IPR \"would be in a strong position to drive a costly settlement with the Post Office\".",
      "The BBC has also obtained a document from 20 May the same year, which was sent to then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown and other government officials, warning about the issue of who owned the code.",
      "In it, a Treasury civil servant states that one of the \"main problems\" with the terms of a proposed deal with ICL for the Horizon software was the \"issues surrounding ownership of assets and IPR of the kit acquired by\" the Post Office.",
      "Mr Coyne, the IT expert, said it was \"utter madness\" that the deal went ahead in July 1999 because it meant that the Post Office became \"operationally reliant on Horizon\", even though it did not own the rights to use the system without Fujitsu.",
      "A spokesperson for Sir Tony Blair did not address the BBC's questions around his knowledge of the IPR issues but said he \"took very seriously the issues raised about the Horizon contract\" at the time.",
      "\"The final decision was taken after an investigation by an independent panel recommended it was viable.",
      "\"It is now clear that the Horizon product was seriously flawed, leading to tragic and completely unacceptable consequences, and Mr Blair has deep sympathy with all those affected.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Gordon Brown said he \"would not have been shown the memo\" from 20 May 1999 and he would have been copied in as a \"formality\".",
      "\"He was not involved in any work related to the purchasing, award or management of the Horizon contract.\"",
      "The warnings about ownership of the IPR came true more than a decade later when Post Office decided to invite other companies to take over the Horizon contract.",
      "Former executives told the Post Office Inquiry, which is examining decisions leading up to the wrongful convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters, how the company had found it difficult to replace Fujitsu.",
      "Alisdair Cameron, former chief financial officer at the Post Office, said that Fujitsu had been \"difficult colleagues\" and \"it was accepted that Horizon, and the infrastructure on which it was built, was vulnerable\".",
      "But Mike Young, chief operations officer at the Post Office between October 2010 and April 2012, told the inquiry that Fujitsu management said to him \"the code is ours. You own the service because you pay for that but you don't pay [for] the code\".",
      "Documents released by the Post Office Inquiry show the \"IPR issue\" was often discussed by top-level Post Office executives.",
      "\"There is a risk that we may be unable to agree an IP license with Fujitsu on reasonable terms\", said an agenda for a Post Office board meeting in July 2013 - while other documents describe concerns over costs.",
      "Procurement specialist Ian Makgill told us he believes not owning the IPR to the Horizon software would have been a factor in the collapse of the 2016 IBM deal to replace the system.",
      "He said that if IBM had tried to build new software without any of the IPR from Horizon, it would have needed to \"start from scratch, which would have cost the Post Office hundreds of millions of pounds\".",
      "\"IPR is the reason why the Post Office hasn't been able to move away from Fujitsu and the Horizon software,\" he said.",
      "Since 1999, the Post Office has spent \u00a32.5bn on contracts with Fujitsu. This figure includes more than \u00a3600m spent on bridging or extension contracts to continue the Horizon contract since the Post Office started looking for new suppliers in 2012, according to analysis from data firm Tussell and the BBC.",
      "Many of the sub-postmasters wrongly accused by the Post Office maintained that there was no missing money and the shortfalls were down to errors in the Horizon system.",
      "But with the Post Office unable to directly inspect the system which processed transactions, it accepted assurances from Fujitsu that the system was working correctly.",
      "\"Fujitsu were fighting the whole time to protect their investment and their intellectual property, rather than looking after the interests of the sub-postmasters,\" said Mr Makgill.",
      "Fujitsu did not respond to the BBC's specific questions but stated that it was \"focused on supporting the Post Office in their plans for a new service delivery model\" so branches can continue to operate.",
      "Mr Makgill said that the Post Office bears the \"ultimate responsibility\" over the fate of wrongly accused sub-postmasters.",
      "\"They didn't have to take those prosecutions, they didn't have to take people to court.\"",
      "Sub-postmasters currently using the Horizon IT software continue to report issues with it. Seven in 10 said they had experienced an \"unexplained discrepancy\" on the system since January 2020, according to a YouGov survey with 1,015 respondents commissioned by the Post Office Inquiry in 2024.",
      "The Post Office has said that it has not undertaken any prosecutions related to Horizon since 2015 and \"has no intention of doing so\".",
      "It told the BBC that it is \"implementing changes across the entire organisation\" so that it is \"fit for the future, fundamentally changed and with postmasters at its heart\".",
      "It said this includes working with Fujitsu to correct discrepancies and reviewing the current version of Horizon - replacing it in stages, under a five-year plan named the \"Future Technology Portfolio\".",
      "Post Office chairman Nigel Railton has said a new IT system would not be introduced in one \"big bang\" but there would be gradual changes.",
      "The Post Office did not respond to the BBC's specific questions about IPR being the reason why the company was unable to ditch Fujitsu, and said it would not be appropriate to comment ahead of the Post Office Inquiry's final report.",
      "The Department of Business and Trade told the BBC that it was providing \u00a3136m of funding over the next five years to the Future Technology Portfolio, and was \"working at pace\" to ensure the Post Office had the technology it needed, including replacing the Horizon system.",

      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Paphitis said retailers had been lobbying government \"for a very, very long time\", arguing the rule had a devastating impact \"on our retail landscape and our high streets\".",
      "He joined the bosses of Sainsbury's, Currys and the British Retail Consortium in welcoming the government's consultation on the rule.",
      "UK businesses bringing in larger shipments have to pay taxes, and they also argue that cheaper goods might fail to meet the same environmental and ethical standards that they have to keep to.",
      "Aside from concerns over unfair competition with domestic retailers, it has also been raised that governments could be missing out on potential tax income.",
      "DHL suspends high value US deliveries over tariffs",
      "Shein and Temu warn tariffs will raise prices in US",
      "The so-called \"de minimis\" rule has received renewed interest after US President Donald Trump scrapped a similar measure amid his escalating trade war with China.",
      "Goods worth less than $800 moving into the US will soon be subject to charges, when they were previously exempt. The move has already prompted Chinese retailers to raise their prices.",
      "In the UK, there are further concerns that China will dump goods here to avoid the tariffs which Trump has imposed on its exports.",
      "Earlier this month, the boss of Currys told the Financial Times that the \"single biggest area where lots of stock is likely to land in the UK... is from the likes of Shein, Temu, Alibaba, TikTok shop and, most of all, Amazon marketplace\".",
      "On Thursday, Alex Baldock told the BBC that he was pleased the government was \"reviewing the low-value shipment loophole, and that they're committed to levelling the playing field between British and overseas retailers\".",
      "But the Federation of Small Businesses urged the government to proceed with caution in its de minimis consultation, suggesting that scrapping it might \"ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers\".",
      "\"With 16% of goods moved by small firms sitting below the \u00a3135 threshold, a decision to scrap it impacts on trading and inflation,\" said Tina McKenzie, chair of the FSB.",
      "\"It's right to be concerned about potential future dumping of goods, as escalating tariffs applied by bigger global blocs against each other may mean a surge in goods arriving in markets like our own,\" she added.",
      "'Absolute nonsense'",
      "Mr Paphitis told the BBC it was \"absolute nonsense\" that the measure kept inflation and prices down, arguing it led to a loss of jobs and tax revenue for the UK, due to businesses being unable to compete with cheaper foreign rivals.",
      "Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, the trade body for retailers, said the review was \"more critical now\" due to a \"rise in the number of potentially non-compliant products entering the UK market\".",
      "The British Independent Retailers Association said small packages having no tax or charges was a key concern. It called on ministers to act to \"deter import surges\" in order to \"protect independent retailers\".",
      "When Sainsbury's announced their latest financial results earlier this month, boss Simon Roberts called on the government to act as soon as possible.",
      "\"Everyone should pay their tax... So if there's a loophole here which means that's not happening, then that needs to be closed so it's a level playing field for everybody,\" he said."

      "He did not set out details of the \"zonal pricing\" scheme, which is meant to make the national energy grid more efficient and encourage investment.",
      "But he rejected claims in a Daily Telegraph article that it would mean increased energy bills for southern English households.",
      "Some energy companies have backed the idea - but others say it will scare off investment and lead to higher bills.",

      "Could Scotland have Europe's lowest electricity bills?",
      "GB Energy to be blocked from using slavery-linked solar",
      "According to the Telegraph government officials have advised Miliband to back plans for a form of regional pricing used in some other parts of the world including Australia, Italy and Sweden.",
      "If implemented, it would be the biggest reform of the power market since the 1990s privatisation.",
      "Under the scheme, power costs would match local supply and demand. In practice it could lead to lower bills in areas with abundant wind generation like Scotland rather than households in the South.",
      "The scheme is supported by some energy businesses - including Greg Jackson, the boss of Octopus Energy, the UK's largest domestic energy supplier.",
      "Mr Jackson said it could make the overall system more efficient and reduce the amount of network upgrades needed to shift the electricity from where it's generated to where it's consumed.",
      "But Dale Vince, the founder of green energy company Ecotricity and a Labour donor, said on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that zonal pricing was a \"terrible idea\" as \"tens of millions of Britons could end up paying more for their energy than they do now\".",
      "Speaking ahead of an international energy security summit in London, Miliband said the government were considering options to change energy pricing but insisted \"absolutely no decision has been made\".",
      "\"This is an incredibly complex question that we are looking at about how we reform our energy market,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"There are two options, zonal pricing and reformed national pricing.",

      "The party's energy and net zero spokesperson, Pippa Heylings, said: \"In a cost-of-living crisis and when energy giants have been raking it in - energy bills should be going down not up.\"",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the plans \"a form of bribery\", saying cheaper bills would be a payoff for massive infrastructure projects \"ruining\" the local area.",
      "\"None of this I think has been fully thought through,\" he argued.",

      "But Musk said his \"time allocation to Doge\" would \"drop significantly\" from next month, adding he would spend only one to two days per week on it after accusations he has taken his focus off Tesla.",
      "His political involvement has sparked protests and boycotts of Tesla cars around the world.",
      "Temporary government employees, such as Musk, are normally limited to working 130 days a year which, if counted from the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration, is set to expire late next month.",
      "But it is unclear when Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely.",
      "Trump said earlier this month he would keep Musk \"as long as I could keep him\".",
      "Who is Elon Musk?",
      "What is Doge and why is Musk cutting so many jobs?",
      "Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk",
      "The tech boss said he would now \"be allocating far more of my time to Tesla\", but suggested he would not leave the Trump administration completely, calling the work \"critical\" and pledging to stay on \"as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful\".",
      "On Tuesday, Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales for the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year, while profits fell more than 70%.",
      "The company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying \"changing political sentiment\" could meaningfully hurt demand.",
      "Musk blamed the boycott of Tesla cars on people who would \"try to attack me and the Doge team\".",
      "Shares in the company had shed about 37% of their value this year as of market close on Tuesday. They rose by more than 5% in after-hours trading following the results.",
      "Trump's tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. \"Rapidly evolving trade policy\" could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company.",
      "\"This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,\" Tesla's quarterly update said.",
      "Musk has clashed on trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.",
      "On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were \"still tough on a company where margins are low\".",
      "\"I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,\" he said.",
      "'Problems mounting'",
      "Earlier this month, he called Navarro a \"moron\" over comments he had made about Tesla. Navarro had said Musk was \"not a car manufacturer\" but a \"car assembler, in many cases\".",
      "Georg Ell, who knew Musk and was director for Western Europe at Tesla, told the BBC's Today programme that if the multi-billionaire \"focuses on the companies where he is extraordinary, I think people will focus once again on the quality of the product and experiences\".",
      "\"I think Elon is not someone who surrounds himself with a great diversity of opinion to challenge his thinking, he's a pretty single-minded individual,\" added Mr Ell, who is now chief executive of translation software firm Phrase.",
      "Tesla said artificial intelligence would contribute to future growth, though investors have been unconvinced by such arguments in the past.",
      "Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called expectations \"rock-bottom\" after the company said earlier this month that the number of cars sold in the quarter had fallen 13% to the lowest level in three years.",
      "The firm faces fierce competition, Mr Coatsworth said, warning that potential disruption to global supply chains as a result of Trump's trade war also created risks.",

      "It has issued a \u20ac500m (\u00a3428m) fine to Apple over its App Store, while Meta has been fined \u20ac200m (\u00a3171m) over how much choice users had to consent to data collection.",
      "\"We have a duty to protect the rights of citizens and innovative businesses in Europe,\" Commissioner Henna Virkkunen said in a statement.",
      "The two tech firms have reacted angrily, with Meta accusing the EU of \"attempting to handicap successful American businesses\" and Apple saying it was being \"unfairly targeted\" and forced to \"give away our technology for free.\"",
      "The fines are lower than some of those issued by the EU in the past but - given the heightened economic tensions with America - still risk angering US President Donald Trump.",
      "The US has levied a 10% tariff on imports from the EU, which Trump has accused of \"taking advantage\" of America.",
      "EU spokesperson Arianna Podesta insisted the matters were \"completely separate\", telling the BBC: \"This is about enforcement, it's not about trade negotiations.\"",

      "Data and apps",
      "The European Commission - the EU's executive - started both investigations last year under a new law brought in to promote fairness in the tech sector called the Digital Markets Act (DMA).",
      "The case against Apple was over its App Store.",
      "The Commission says it must freely offer alternative app marketplaces to users and app developers - and says Apple was in breach of this.",
      "Meanwhile, Meta's fine was over the choices it offered on data collection.",
      "Meta introduced a \"consent or pay\" model, which meant users had to choose between allowing Meta to combine data it had collected on Facebook and Instagram, or paying a monthly subscription.",
      "The Commission says this model did not allow users to freely consent to how their data was used.",
      "In November, Meta introduced another option, which the Commission says \"allegedly uses less personal data to display advertisements.\"",
      "The Commission is currently assessing the new option.",
      "In both cases, the Commission says the size of the fine takes into account \"the gravity and duration of the non-compliance\".",
      "Both companies have 60 days to comply or risk further fines.",
      "\"Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,\" said Commissioner Teresa Ribera.",
      "\"As a result, we have taken firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules.\"",
      "Apple said the Commission had made \"a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.\"",
      "It also accused the Commission of \"[moving] the goal posts\" during their meetings.",
      "Meta said the ruling means Chinese and European companies are allowed to operate to different standards compared to American businesses.",
      "\"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Epic dispute",
      "The fines are relatively small given the tech companies' huge worldwide revenues - and are a fraction of Google's \u20ac2.4bn fine from last September.",
      "But they are significant in the context of the current global economic situation.",
      "In February, Donald Trump's White House issued a memorandum complaining about EU and UK regulation of American tech firms.",
      "\"Today's decisions are important in that they confirm that the European Commission will not back down,\" Anne Witt, professor of law at the EDHEC Business School in France, told the BBC.",
      "Prof Witt said the disagreement was \"not so much about substantive antitrust principles,\" given the US government is itself taking a number of big tech companies to court over alleged monopoly power.",
      "They are more \"about the fact that European institutions are telling US companies how to behave, even if these decisions are limited to have these companies behave on European soil,\" she added.",
      "One company pleased with the ruling against Apple is Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite.",
      "They had a long-running dispute over the distribution of their apps on Apple devices.",

      "A US-based think tank, which is partly funded by big tech firms including Apple and Meta, came out against the decision.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86je4vyg36o",
    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 06:56:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Australia has proposed to create a strategic reserve of critical minerals.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (\u00a3580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate.",
      "The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots.",
      "China's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen as retaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance?",
      "What are rare earth minerals and why are they important?",
      "Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named \"rare\" because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine.",
      "Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades \u2013 including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems.",
      "Albanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt.",
      "Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining \u2013 which makes them usable in technology \u2013 takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply.",
      "And that has spooked Western governments.",
      "Why is China restricting the export of rare earth minerals?",
      "Beijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%.",
      "But analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened.",
      "Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had \"dropped the ball\" on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement.",
      "\"China has its foot on the blood vein\u2026 of US and European defence systems,\" he added.",
      "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies.",
      "Could Australia's proposal change the game?",
      "Albanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both \"domestic industry and international partners\", in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU.",
      "But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as \"long overdue\", added that the proposal is \"not going to solve the problem\".",
      "The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China.",
      "Lithium \u2013 not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels \u2013 is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition.",
      "Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths.",
      "But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington.",
      "How will the US and China respond?",
      "China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump.",
      "In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to \"join hands\" with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected.",
      "Australia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products.",
      "But analysts say Albanese's proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China.",
      "Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese's plan was \"more sophisticated\" than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia's resources at moments of economic tension.",
      "If China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices.",
      "But she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China.",
      "\"If [Australia's] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West \u2013 especially the US \u2013 there are weak spots China can enter \u2013 and the most important is refining.\"",

    "summary": "The rail and road link will slash journey times between much of Scandinavia and continental Europe.",
    "story": [
      "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.",
      "Running for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.",
      "It's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.",
      "The project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.",
      "The facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\".",
      "\"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.",
      "To make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete.",
      "Most underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France \u2013 burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.",
      "\"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\"",
      "With a price-tag around \u20ac7.4bn ($8.1bn; \u00a36.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with \u20ac1.3bn from the European Commission.",
      "It's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.",
      "Once completed, the journey between R\u00f8dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.",
      "Bypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers.",
      "\"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\"",
      "Towered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.",
      "\"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.",
      "There are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.",
      "At the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\"",
      "Not only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.",
      "Next it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.",
      "\"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\"",
      "Denmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.",
      "With layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.",
      "A bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.",
      "\"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\"",
      "So, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\"",
      "Denmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.",
      "One such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.",
      "However in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.",
      "\"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.",
      "When the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.",
      "According to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says.",
      "It's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.",
      "\"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\""

    "summary": "Mortgage experts share their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
    "story": [
      "Mortgage rates are expected to come down over the next year, which could make owning a home a possibility for millions more people.",
      "Thinking about where to start can be a daunting prospect, but there are an increasing number of ways to save up for a deposit, and get a foothold in the housing market.",
      "We spoke to some leading mortgage experts to get their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
      "1. Start saving as soon as you can",
      "The average deposit paid for a first-time buyer is \u00a334,500, according to UK Finance. So the sooner you start saving, the better.",
      "A Lifetime ISA (individual savings account) offers 25% bonuses for those who are saving for a first home. For each \u00a34,000 saved in any given tax year, the government will top it up with an extra \u00a31,000.",
      "Digital mortgage broker Tembo specialises in helping first-time buyers, and has seen a rise in savers starting young.",
      "\"If you maxed out your savings allowance from the age of 18 to 30, you could pick up \u00a322,000 in free bonuses,\" says Tembo chief executive Richard Dana.",
      "\"Family members can contribute too. But beware that the money can only be withdrawn to fund a first-time home purchase up to the value of \u00a3450,000.\"",
      "2. Look at low-deposit mortgage options",
      "Those struggling to raise a deposit have now got a broad range of 95% loan-to-value (LTV) deals available, says David Hollingworth from mortgage brokers London & Country.",
      "In fact, more low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures.",
      "\"Yorkshire Building Society offers a \u00a35,000 deposit mortgage which does what it says on the tin and could offer a mortgage equivalent to as much as 99% of the purchase price,\" says Mr Hollingsworth.",
      "\"Skipton's Track Record mortgage can offer as much as 100% lending for those that can demonstrate a track record of paying rent that exceeds the mortgage payment.\"",
      "However, small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria.",
      "3. Explore shared ownership",
      "Shared ownership has been available in England since the 1980s and enables a first-time buyer to own a \"share\" in their home of between 25% and 75% of the value. There are similar schemes available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "You need a small deposit and can take out a mortgage to buy your share and then pay rent to the landlord for the rest.",
      "Over time you can increase the amount of the property you own and reduce rental payments. It's known as \"staircasing\" and the aim is to eventually own your home outright.",
      "\"Although shared ownership is usually seen as an option for younger, first-time buyers, that is not always the case,\" says Laura Gaskell, sales manager at shared ownership specialists Snugg Homes.",
      "\"The average age of a buyer with us is now 48 and we have people who have been homeowners previously. Our advice is to register your interest and regularly check the eligibility criteria.\"",
      "4. Consider an 'income boost' mortgage",
      "The \"Bank of Mum and Dad\" might not be an option for some, but there are ways to get help from family members without borrowing any money at all.",
      "An \"income boost\" mortgage (otherwise known as a Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor mortgage) allows a homebuyer to add up to three family members (or in some cases friends) to their mortgage to increase the amount they can borrow from a lender.",
      "While the \"boosters\" are on the mortgage, they are not owners of the home and therefore the buyer's first-time buyer status is not affected.",
      "\"This is increasingly popular amongst younger first-time buyers who are earlier in their careers and are earning less,\" says Richard Dana from Tembo.",
      "\"It's the primary option for families who want to support their children, but might not have the cash available to gift as a deposit, or want to keep hold of cash savings for their retirement or a rainy day.\"",
      "As buyers will be borrowing more than they would qualify for on their own, they should make sure they can afford the repayments.",
      "The risk for the \"boosters\" is that they are jointly liable for the mortgage in the event the buyer is unable to make repayments.",
      "5. 'Professional' mortgages are available",
      "Many lenders offer \"professional\" mortgages which could enable a buyer working in a regulated or accredited profession - such as doctors, architects and accountants - to borrow up to six times their income.",
      "Specialist lenders also offer deals to particular professions.",
      "For instance, Teachers Building Society works with those in the teaching profession, while Kensington offers a better earnings calculation to NHS staff, police officers, firefighters and teachers.",
      "\"Given that these career profiles are often more secure, Kensington felt it could be more generous in its approach as long as the mortgage will be affordable,\" says David Hollingworth.",
      "\"It can also take account of overtime and income from a second job to help improve the borrowing amount.\"",
      "But he adds: \"It's always still important to shop around. Rates on these mortgages can be a little higher, so taking advice on the best overall fit is important.\"",
      "Stamp duty changes 'will motivate first-time buyers'",
      "'Buying a first home is harder when you're single'",
      "When will interest rates go down again?"

    "story": [
      "Domestic energy prices are forecast to fall in July, reversing three consecutive increases in regulator Ofgem's price cap.",
      "The annual bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by \u00a3166 a year, a drop of nearly 9%, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted.",
      "It comes after a series of household bills became more expensive in April, and would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost \u00a31,683.",
      "The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill - so if you use more, you pay more.",
      "Huge uncertainty",
      "The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by Ofgem.",
      "While the quarterly change can skew annual comparisons, the regulator illustrates the effect of the price cap with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.",
      "In the three months from July last year, that typical bill stood at \u00a31,568 a year. It rose on each of the three occasions the cap was set after that, the most recent of which was at the start of April.",
      "The predicted fall of almost 9% in July - if it happens - would bring it sharply down to the lowest level since last September.",
      "Cornwall Insight also expects a slight fall in prices in October and another drop in January 2026.",
      "However, analysts said great uncertainty still surrounded these forecasts.",
      "\"While a fall in bills will always be welcomed by households, we mustn't get ahead of ourselves. We have all seen markets go up as fast as they go down, and the very fact the market dropped so quickly shows how vulnerable it is to geopolitical and market shifts,\" said Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, which is widely recognised for the accuracy of its predictions.",
      "\"There is unfortunately no guarantee that any fall in prices will be sustained.",
      "\"The only real way to protect households from this constant cycle of instability and insecurity is to reduce our dependence on international wholesale markets.\"",
      "The fall in the wholesale cost of energy, paid by suppliers, is behind the latest predictions.",
      "That has been affected by US tariffs policy and warmer-than-expected weather in Europe."

      "The DfE is also clamping down on nurseries charging for extras, such as meals, snacks and nappies. Its updated guidance says that nurseries are entitled to ask parents to pay for such extras - but these charges must be clear and are voluntary.",
      "This is causing \"enormous stress,\" claims Ms Tanuku.",
      "\"We can't give out meals for free\" one nursery owner told me, \"we just don't know how this is going to work\".",
      "Some nurseries have threatened to pull out of the scheme altogether.",
      "But Phillipson says that \"despite the inherited challenges\", they are pressing ahead \"with the investment and leadership needed to support families and make sure that every child, regardless of background, can access the high-quality early education they deserve\".",
      "In the meantime, local authority-run nurseries are continuing their long term decline. The BBC has found that 23 council-run nurseries, 16 Sure Start centres and 12 maintained nursery schools, which offer funded hours, are either under review, being privatised or in the process of closing across England.",
      "Staffing was one of the main reasons given. Finding suitable trained staff remains a real problem for the sector.",
      "Working families and eligibility",
      "The cost of childcare in the UK remains one of the highest in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, for many parents who cannot access the free hours.",
      "To qualify for the new hours, all adults in a household must be working and earn more than \u00a39,518 but less than \u00a3100,000 per year.",
      "David from London was devastated to find out that he and his wife were not eligible for the free hours. His wife is retraining to be an occupational therapist so they aren't classed as a \"working family\". And London and the East of England have the highest childcare costs in England.",
      "\"We just assumed we were eligible and didn't think for a second we wouldn't be,\" he says. \"It's just the unfairness of it\u2026 it seems to be a huge oversight.",
      "\"The NHS does offer a bursary but we are having to use our savings and are paying \u00a320,000 a year now on childcare. It's a huge disincentive to retraining and to a lot of people it would be prohibitive.\"",
      "The government says there is a range of support for students in further or higher education.",
      "Coram Family and Childcare's annual report, which looks at the cost of childcare, warned that families who aren't eligible, are not in work, or who do not earn enough to be eligible are now paying an average of around \u00a35,000 a year more than families who do have access, for a part-time place for a child under two.",
      "This raises questions, according to the report, about whether disadvantaged children have the same opportunities as their more affluent peers.",
      "Research by IPPR with Save the Children found that the childcare expansion is at risk of not delivering for those families. Only a third of the poorest families use formal childcare, compared to almost three quarters of the highest earning households.",
      "\"The government is in a really tough spot,\" says Ms Morjaria. \"They have this kind of legacy policy that the Conservative government have chosen to fund and it clearly leaves out a section of young children and gives access to those with working families.",
      "\"Is it a gap widening policy? Of course it is, particularly where you think about early childcare as early education, because there is a really substantial proportion of young children not receiving that.\"",
      "Question of child development",
      "The government's other ambition is for 75% of children to reach a \"good level of development\" at the end of reception, by 2028. (This includes skills like being able to follow instructions in maths and literacy.)",
      "The figure was 67.7% in 2023 to 2024. Phillipson has said \"giving every child the best start in life is my top priority, and integral to our mission to ensure tens of thousands more children are school ready every year\".",
      "The poorest children have access to 15 hours a week of free childcare during term-time when they are two, but children of working parents will have access to 30 hours from nine months.",
      "\"That's quite difficult\", says Ms Farquharson. \"It is that disadvantaged group that's precisely those most vulnerable children [who] you want to target and support.\"",
      "In the Shirecliffe area of Sheffield, Meadows Nursery opened during the pandemic in joint venture with the local school, Sheffield Hallam University and charity, Save the Children.",
      "The idea was to help children who were already behind and give parents access to spaces. \"A private nursery would not have opened here in a million years\", claims Claire Carroll, who is head of nurseries at the university.",
      "Most of the children in the 40-place setting are two and three, and receive 15 hours a week of free childcare. \"We find many of them haven't reached their physical milestones,\" she says.",
      "\"They might live in a one bedroom flat with six people in it and no balcony, they haven't got a garden to run around in and the local parks are run down and not necessarily safe.\"",
      "She believes that it is vital to give this group of children more access to free childcare.",
      "The Dfe has announced \"the largest ever uplift to the early years pupil premium, increasing the rate by over 45%\", so the most disadvantaged children are accessing the high-quality early years education they need, a spokesperson said.",
      "A system under strain",
      "The government is doubling the amount it spends on childcare to help parents back into the workplace. By 2026, it will cost around \u00a38bn. But the system is under strain.",
      "What it needs is the right staff and enough places to make it work. Helping children reach a good level of development is also vital, according to many of those experts.",
      "Phillipson has been clear: \"every child, regardless of background\" should be able to access high-quality early education.",
      "It remains to be seen how the system will cope from September.",
      "However Farquharson believes the government's dual aims \u2013 around growth and child development - are trying to solve different problems.",
      "\"We're doubling the amount that we spend on free childcare in England,\" she warns, \"[and] when you make that kind of a policy commitment, there's always going to be a risk of unintended consequences.\"",

      "Gregg Wallace has defended himself against allegations about him, insisting \"they're not all true\".",
      "Speaking to the Daily Mail, Wallace - who stepped away from presenting MasterChef last November in the wake of the claims against him - said he felt \"under attack\" and that he had contemplated suicide.",
      "A BBC News investigation revealed allegations of inappropriate sexual comments by 13 people who had worked with Wallace across a range of shows, over a 17-year-period.",
      "Since then, further claims of \"groping\" and \"touching\" have emerged, all of which Wallace has strenuously denied.",
      "MasterChef's production company, Banijay, has launched an inquiry into the historical allegations.",
      "In his first interview since the claims emerged, Wallace said that he had received \"a tidal wave of abuse\" on social media after posting a video on Instagram hitting out at his accusers.",
      "In the video, which he subsequently apologised for, he said the claims against him had come from \"a handful of middle-class women of a certain age\".",
      "\"News channels were updating hourly with new allegations,\" he said.",
      "\"You're watching yourself get personally ripped apart, criticised, accused of all sorts of stuff over and over again. You're thinking, \"This isn't true. It isn't true. What's coming next?\"",
      "Wallace said he couldn't sleep at the time, adding: \"The feeling of being under attack, of isolation, of abandonment was overwhelming. Nobody from the BBC contacted me once these stories started breaking \u2013 absolutely nobody at all.\"",

      "'Groping' and 'touching': Fresh claims against Gregg Wallace",
      "Wallace said that at the time, his mother called him to ask why people were \"picking on him\".",
      "He said he responded: \"I've said something really stupid. They're investigating my behaviour, but more and more people are coming forward with complaints about me. Mum, they're not all true. I haven't done these things.\"",
      "Wallace revealed that his mother recently died, adding that it was \"terribly sad\" that she had spent the last few days of her life reading \"horrible things\" about him.",
      "One of the women who spoke to BBC News as part of its investigation was broadcaster Kirsty Wark who appeared on Celebrity MasterChef.",
      "Wark accused Wallace of telling \"sexualised jokes\" during the filming of the show, and said that it left people feeling \"uncomfortable\".",
      "But Wallace says he was never aware he had offended her until it came to light last year, saying: \"I thought we got on.\"",
      "Other high-profile media personalities, including Vanessa Feltz and Kirstie Allsopp, also spoke up at the time.",
      "Wallace said that Feltz's complaint \"knocked him for six\", and also pushed back against Allsopp's comments about his language, saying: \"I wouldn't have said that.\"",
      "'Absolutely not true'",
      "Writing on Instagram in November, singer Sir Rod Stewart described Wallace as an \"ill-mannered bully\", and said the presenter \"humiliated\" his wife Penny Lancaster when she was on Masterchef in 2021.",
      "Addressing that claim, Wallace said it was a \"shame\" as he liked Sir Rod. He acknowledged there had been a \"falling out\" between himself and Lancaster, but said it was over \"whether an orchid should stay on a bowl of soup or not\".",
      "He also addressed other allegations that emerged towards the end of last year, including one that he'd walked around on set naked with a sock on his penis.",
      "He admitted to putting a \"sock over my private bits\" and opening his dressing room door shouting \"hooray\", but claimed he did this to three friends who were in the studio after filming had finished, rather than while it was taking place.",
      "He admitted that some of the inappropriate jokes were \"probably true\", saying: \"Some of what's been said sounds like the sort of comments I'd have made.\"",
      "But he insisted he never groped any workers, calling those claims \"absolutely not true\".",
      "He also said that many of those who work with him had been supportive, including John Torode, his co-presenter on MasterChef.",
      "Torode has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "When Banijay launched an inquiry, Wallace said his \"world tumbled in\".",
      "\"It's very difficult to explain the pressure unless you've been through it. I thought about suicide all the time: \"Is my insurance up to date? Will [Wallace's wife] Anna get some money? She doesn't deserve this. It would be better if I wasn't here.\"",
      "He told the newspaper Banijay had arranged for a crisis mentor to support him.",
      "Wallace said he was recently diagnosed with autism, saying: \"I want to make it absolutely clear I'm not blaming my behaviour on my diagnosis, but it does explain a hell of a lot to me.\"",
      "He added that he accepts he was \"very slow to wake up\" to a changing work environment.",
      "\"It wasn't until seven years ago that I had a massive wake-up call and realised the loud, energetic greengrocer persona I was on the telly was, maybe, becoming redundant. So I changed.\"",
      "\"I honestly never meant to upset anyone. I thought I was going in every day and just delivering what was wanted. I didn't realise I was causing any problems.\"",
      "Wallace has been one of Britain's most high profile presenters for more than two decades.",
      "BBC News, which is editorially independent from the wider organisation, started investigating Wallace last summer, after becoming aware of allegations. The claims were made across five shows, from 2005 to 2022.",
      "Most of the allegations came from production workers. Many were young female freelancers.",
      "Allegations heard include Wallace talking openly about his sex life, taking his top off in front of a female worker saying he wanted to \"give her a fashion show\", and telling a junior female colleague he wasn't wearing any boxer shorts under his jeans.",
      "BBC News has also heard from a former MasterChef worker who says he showed her topless pictures of himself and asked for massages, and a former worker on Channel 5's Gregg Wallace's Big Weekends, who says he was fascinated by the fact she dated women and asked for the logistics of how it worked.",
      "Another female worker on MasterChef in 2019 says Wallace talked about his sex life; a female worker on the BBC Good Food Show in 2010 says Wallace stared at her chest; and a male worker on MasterChef in 2005-06 says Wallace regularly said sexually explicit things on set.",
      "After BBC News's initial investigation, more women came forward with claims.",
      "One woman says he touched her bottom at an event and another says he pressed his crotch against her while filming on a different show.",
      "His lawyers have strongly denied he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature.",
      "Wallace has repeatedly declined interview requests from BBC News.",

    "story": [
      "The culture secretary has said the BBC's licence fee is \"unenforceable\" and insisted \"no options are off the table\" when the government begins a review into the corporation's current funding model later this year.",
      "In an interview with the Telegraph, Lisa Nandy said there were \"problems\" with the annual charge, with \"fewer and fewer people\" paying the \u00a3174.50 fee.",
      "The charter, which expires in 2027 and is under review, is an agreement between the BBC and the government that sets out the terms and purposes of the corporation - including the existence of the licence fee.",
      "A BBC spokeswoman said the broadcaster looks forward to engaging with the government and securing the long-term future of the BBC.",
      "Nandy has already started negotiations with the BBC about the corporation's funding.",
      "It currently gets most of its income from the licence fee - in the last financial year, the BBC received \u00a33.7bn, or about two-thirds of its total income, from it.",
      "\"We're open to a different system,\" she told the Telegraph, but admitted no preferred options had been put forward yet.",
      "She added the government wanted the public's input in shaping the new model to create \"a fairer, more sustainable system\".",
      "According to the BBC, 80% of households currently pay the licence fee.",
      "Nandy also said she had been \"very concerned\" about the way the fee had been enforced in the past as it had been found to disproportionately target women.",
      "Two BBC reviews found the gender disparity had been due to societal factors.",
      "The review in 2017 detailed a gender skew towards women-only households, a greater likelihood of women answering the door to TV Licensing Enquiry Officers and a higher chance of them engaging positively with an officer.",
      "In 2023, the BBC set out plans to reduce the high proportion of women being prosecuted for licence fee evasion, after figures showed that they made up 76% of the 52,376 people convicted over it in 2020.",
      "Nandy has previously said the charge was \"deeply regressive\" and that she was thinking \"quite radically and creatively\" about alternatives. But the minister has ruled out using general taxation to fund the BBC.",
      "She did, however, keep open the possibility of a subscription model.",
      "Last month in a Sunday Times interview, the corporation's chairman suggested wealthier households could be charged more.",
      "A BBC spokeswoman said: \"The public cares about the BBC and we have launched our biggest ever public engagement exercise, so audiences can help drive and shape what they want from a universal and independent BBC in the future.",

      "A Dutch town hall has admitted that it \"most likely\" accidentally disposed of 46 artworks, including an Andy Warhol print of the former Dutch queen, during renovation works last year.",
      "Maashorst municipality said the works, including a 1980s silkscreen print of Queen Beatrix worth about \u20ac15,000 (\u00a312,800), disappeared during work on a town hall last year.",

      "The news comes after it was revealed that EastEnders has been named recipient of the 2025 Bafta TV craft special award for its commitment to taking on and nurturing new talent off-screen.",

      "\"She does all this with enormous charm and wit,\" she added.",
      "Wark was described as a \"legend of British journalism\" by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair during her final Newsnight show in July 2024, while former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told her: \"To say you are a broadcasting titan... would be an understatement. It's hard to imagine that landscape without you.\"",

      "Two years later, she famously locked horns with Margaret Thatcher in a headline-making interview which propelled her into the national spotlight.",
      "She joined BBC Two's arts strand The Late Show as a presenter and then moved on to Newsnight in 1993.",

      "A number of actors from the programme were at the Scottish Parliament to hear a motion to save the show, which is due to end next year.",
      "Stephen Purdon, who has played Bob (previously 'Shellsuit Bob') in the show since it began, told BBC Scotland News the programme served as a pipeline for talent who could otherwise be lost to the industry.",
      "BBC Scotland announced the decision to axe the soap last month, citing changes in audience behaviour away from long-running series.",
      "Past and present cast members - including Frank Gallagher, who played crime boss Lenny Murdoch, and Gary: Tank Commander star Scott Fletcher - held placards up outside Holyrood protesting the cancellation, before sitting in the parliament to listen to the motion, brought by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.",
      "Purdon, the only remaining original cast member from its 2002 launch, said the show was important for off-screen talent it nurtured as well as those on screen, emphasising the programme's training academy - which teaches participants through classes and workshops.",
      "He said: \"It's the only Scottish show that is constant throughout the year, and it's not just on screen.",
      "\"It's what goes on behind the scenes, like the training academy \u2013 it's a pathway into the industry for people who maybe don't otherwise have connections.\"",
      "A BBC spokesperson said training opportunities with River City would remain active until April 2026.",
      "BBC Scotland previously said it would increase total investment in drama over the next three years with a focus on \"world-class productions\" that can be sold internationally.",
      "However Purdon said short-term productions would not be able to replicate the consistency of River City, and it would be a \"massive blow to the industry\" if the cancellation went ahead.",
      "He added: \"A six-part drama isn't going to constantly be there.",
      "\"It might be great for a short period of time, but for longevity, a show like River City is a conveyer belt [for talent].\"",
      "Tom Urie, who was in the soap for four years from 2010 to 2014, told the BBC's Scotcast podcast the show was now \"embedded into Scottish culture\".",
      "He said: \"As an actor living in Scotland, it's an accessible ambition to have.",
      "\"If you look at something like Vigil, how would I ever get in that? But you look at River City, and you go maybe one day I'll get into River City because they'll want to do a story about a big guy trying to lose weight.",
      "\"It doesn't feel like something that'll be here for four months and then go away.\"",
      "The series, set in a fictional west of Scotland area called Shieldinch, is filmed on a specially-built set in Dumbarton and featured the likes of Outlander star Sam Heughan in early roles.",
      "Deacon Blue singer Lorraine McIntosh, Scottish acting veteran Johnny Beattie and EastEnders actor Alex Ferns also took roles in the show.",
      "Bibby said he brought the motion in the hope it would encourage BBC Scotland to think again, and that he was particularly concerned over closure of the Dumbarton studio.",
      "He said: \"River City has been a platform and a pathway for young creative talent in Scotland. It's really important we have that platform, and I hope the BBC think again and maintain this iconic soap.\"",
      "The Scottish government's culture secretary Angus Robertson said during the debate the decision to end River City was \"more than regrettable\" and that it displayed a \"worrying trend in decision making that runs counter to the BBC's commitment to invest in the nations.\"",
      "Purdon admitted the cancellation would carry an emotional impact for him personally, too.",
      "He said: \"I'm 42 this year and I started when I was 19 so it means everything to me. I was there before I had my kids and now they see me on screen, so it's very important to me.\""

    "story": [
      "A police watchdog has complained to Ofcom over an episode of Panorama about the shooting of Chris Kaba.",
      "The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) went to the broadcasting watchdog after its request for a public apology from the BBC went unmet, after the programme initially aired without including the IOPC's statement in response to claims made by its own former regional director Sal Naseem.",
      "A BBC spokeswoman said the corporation's own Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) ruling had judged the complaint to be \"resolved\" after it had been accepted as an oversight not to include the IOPC's point of view; the iPlayer version and online article were quickly amended.",
      "Mr Kaba was shot dead after he tried to ram his way out of a police vehicle stop in south London in September 2022.",
      "Sgt Martyn Blake, an officer in the specialist firearms unit MO19, was found not guilty of murder in October last year, prompting protests from the Kaba family.",
      "Speaking after the verdict at the Old Bailey, Mr Kaba's family said it was \"painful proof that our lives are not valued by the system\".",
      "Mr Naseem told BBC Panorama that in his opinion, he had not been convinced that Mr Kaba presented a sufficient danger to justify being shot.",
      "He suggested that the murder investigation into Mr Blake was launched amid pressure over potential unrest, which is denied by the IOPC.",
      "The IOPC complained that the programme did not make clear that Mr Naseem no longer works for the watchdog, and that it was not given the proper right to reply to the claims over why the investigation was launched.",
      "In the programme, Mr Naseem said that when the IOPC launched its homicide investigation four days after the shooting, \"It was fed back to us... that if we hadn't done it at that time then it's likely there would have been a level of disorder.\"",
      "The IOPC's statement denying this was added to the iPlayer version of the Panorama episode and online news stories.",
      "The statement read: \"The decisions to criminally investigate Sergeant Blake, and then refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), followed careful consideration of a significant amount of evidence gathered during our independent investigation and by applying the relevant legal tests which govern our work.\"",
      "According to the BBC complaint unit's judgement, Panorama should have provided the IOPC with specific information about the claims to be made about it, and therefore found an element of unfairness to the IOPC.",
      "However it noted the programme makers had taken subsequent action to include the organisation's right to reply in the iPlayer version and related online article, which was deemed \"sufficient to resolve this aspect of the complaint.\"",
      "But the IOPC said on Thursday it had complained to Ofcom because it was \"hugely dissatisfied that, despite admitting these two breaches of its own guidelines, the BBC has steadfastly refused to apologise publicly despite the IOPC providing evidence to show the serious reputational damage caused to the organisation as a result of the programme.",
      "\"In particular, the suggestion within that programme, that the IOPC was pressured to start a homicide investigation, was wrong and resulted in public criticism from a number of media organisations and individuals including concerns raised by the London Assembly and local councillors about the IOPC's independence and motivations.",
      "\"Had we been aware this would be suggested, we would have strongly refuted it.\"",

      "The singer-songwriter said he hoped the music and lyrics he has written for the show would \"do Paddington proud\", adding that the musical numbers are \"my favourite songs I've ever written\".",
      "The show will open at the Savoy Theatre in the West End on 1 November, and follow Paddington as he arrives from Peru seeking a new home in London.",
      "The musical, which has been in development for five years, is based on Michael Bond's original novels and follows the hugely successful recent film series.",
      "Speaking about the show for the first time, Fletcher told BBC News he felt \"so honoured and lucky\" to be working on the project, which he said would reflect \"all of the fun, warmth and heart that the books and movies have captured so brilliantly\".",
      "\"There is something so magical about seeing Paddington step out on to the stage, and seeing him... I was about to say in the flesh, but I guess in the fur is more accurate,\" he joked.",
      "Fletcher is best-known as the founding member of pop band McFly, whose hits include All About You, Obviously and Star Girl, and is also a successful children's author.",
      "He was first approached about Paddington around the time of the first Covid lockdown in early 2020, and workshopped the project with scriptwriter Jessica Swale, director Luke Sheppard and the producers before the show was formally announced in 2023.",
      "With the musical now almost ready to launch, Swale told BBC News it would feature \"lots of juicy new material\".",
      "\"We're bringing a lot of new flavours to the table, but of course we're all in love with the original material, so we've been faithful to our cast of characters,\" she said.",
      "\"Of course the Browns are part of it, and familiar faces like Mr Gruber and Mr Curry, but there are a lot of new people as well. We've been very inspired by the books and the films but we like to think we're covering new territory.\"",
      "Bond's first book in the series, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958.",
      "The author went on to write 29 Paddington books in total, the final one being Paddington at St Paul's, which was published posthumously in 2018. The stories have sold more than 35 million copies worldwide.",
      "Fletcher said he relished the opportunity to find what \"the musical language\" of Paddington was. \"Having something that everybody knows but no-one's heard what it sounds like yet is a really exciting thing to be able to work on,\" he explained.",
      "He recalled that, when producer Eliza Lumley first called him about the project, he not only immediately replied with \"a very fast 'yes please'\", but began writing music for the show right away.",
      "\"While I was still on the phone to her, I had the idea for a song, so I went and wrote my first song for it that night, instantly after getting off the phone, and that song is still in the musical now.\"",
      "He reflected: \"My instant reaction wasn't to be intimidated, it was to be excited and just so inspired by these stories and films that I already knew, I just jumped straight at my piano and started writing.\"",
      "The three film adaptations of Paddington, featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw, have been a huge success at the box office since the first was released in 2014.",
      "In recent years, London has seen pop group Abba represented by virtual avatars on stage, while some animated film characters have been depicted using more traditional puppeteering methods, such as snowman Olaf in the stage adaptation of Frozen.",
      "It has not yet been revealed what approach producers will take to representing Paddington in the theatre.",
      "\"I don't know what you're talking about, he's a bear!\" joked Swale. \"He's travelling from Peru to be a special part of our show!\"",
      "She continued: \"I can't give away our secrets. One of the things I'm most excited about for this show is the character of Paddington.\"",
      "'The politics of Paddington'",
      "Swale credits producers Lumley and Sonia Friedman for \"really experimenting with every possible way that we could tell the bear's story in the best way, and the magic that they've found in how they do it\u201d, adding: \u201cEvery single time I see Paddington for the first time, it makes me cry.",
      "\"I think he's completely magic, and to me he's very real. But I don't think audiences will be disappointed. It's a wonderful, theatrical version of how to tell this story.\"",
      "As for the character himself, Swale noted the musical \"also reveals the spirit and the politics of Paddington\".",
      "\"For example, Paddington is a refugee, so we want to honour the fact that he is somebody who migrates to the UK and doesn't have a home, and make sure we are conscious of the experience of who he represents.\"",
      "Between now and the show's opening in November, Fletcher said the team would be \"fine-tuning for as long as we can, and making sure that we get it absolutely right\".",
      "He added: \"I really hope that I've done everyone who loves Paddington justice... This is so different to anything I've ever done before. I feel like this show is so ready to be out in the world, it's the most special thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life.\"",
      "The 39-year-old will be on tour with McFly and Busted when the musical opens in November, \"so I'll be going from touring with the band and then rushing back to London to fit it all in\", he explained.",
      "\"It's a slightly hectic schedule, but we'll make it work somehow. I might get confused and start singing Paddington songs on stage with McFly.\"",
      "Most important, of course, is the question of whether or not Paddington's favourite food will feature in the stage adaptation.",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 23:04:10 GMT",
    "summary": "The presenter is stepping down from the football show, but will still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage.",
    "story": [
      "Gary Lineker has said he believes the BBC wanted him to leave Match of the Day as he was negotiating a new contract last year.",
      "The presenter and the BBC jointly announced in November that he would be stepping down from the flagship football programme, although he will still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Amol Rajan why he would choose to leave given his successful tenure, Lineker said: \"Well, perhaps they want me to leave. There was the sense of that.\"",
      "The BBC didn't comment on that suggestion, but at the time Lineker's exit was announced, the corporation's director of sport described him as a \"world-class presenter\".",
      "However, the BBC noted in the same statement that Match of the Day \"continually evolves for changing viewing habits\".",
      "A new trio of presenters - Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan - was announced in January.",
      "Reflecting on his departure from Match of the Day, Lineker told Rajan: \"It's time. I've done it for a long time, it's been brilliant.\"",
      "However, asked why he'd want to leave when the ratings were still high and it was a job Lineker still enjoyed, the former footballer said he \"had the sense\" the BBC had wanted him to step down.",
      "\"I always wanted one more contract, and I was umm-ing and ahh-ing about whether to do three years [more],\" Lineker explained.",
      "But, he continued, the matter of how long to sign for was complicated by the cycle of broadcasting rights for matches.",
      "\"In the end, I think there was a feeling that, because it was a new rights period, it was a chance to change the programme,\" he said.",
      "\"I think it was their preference that I didn't do Match of the Day for one more year, so they could bring in new people. So it's slightly unusual that I would do the FA Cup and the World Cup, but to be honest, it's a scenario that suits me perfectly.\"",
      "Lineker added that he was pleased his football podcasts had been picked up by BBC Sounds as part of a deal with the corporation.",
      "BBC suspension",
      "Lineker was also asked about comments he posted on social media in March 2023, criticising the then-government's immigration policy.",
      "The remarks led to his suspension from the BBC, prompting other sports presenters to down tools in solidarity, something Lineker said he felt \"moved\" by.",
      "Reflecting on his tweets, Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the \"damage\" it did to the BBC.",
      "\"I don't regret saying them publicly, because I was right - what I said, it was accurate - so not at all in that sense.",
      "\"Would I, in hindsight, do it again? No I wouldn't, because of all the nonsense that came with it... It was a ridiculous overreaction that was just a reply to someone that was being very rude. And I wasn't particularly rude back.\"",
      "He continued: \"But I wouldn't do it again because of all the kerfuffle that followed, and I love the BBC, and I didn't like the damage that it did to the BBC... But do I regret it and do I think it was the wrong thing to do? No.\"",
      "The row erupted when Lineker called a government asylum policy \"immeasurably cruel\", and said a video promoting it used language that was \"not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\".",
      "The home secretary at the time, Suella Braverman, who appeared in the video, called his criticism \"offensive\" and \"lazy\", while Downing Street said it was \"not acceptable\".",
      "Lineker's post reignited the debate about the BBC's impartiality guidance on social media and how it applied to presenters.",
      "While staff working in news and current affairs are expected to remain impartial on social platforms, there had been questions over how much the rules extended to BBC personalities in other areas such as entertainment and sport.",
      "Lineker argued that the previous set of rules \"were for people in news and current affairs\".",
      "\"They have subsequently changed,\" he acknowledged. \"But that left people like me, who has always given his honest opinions about things, then they suddenly changed them and you have to go, 'Oh, I've got to be impartial now'. It doesn't make any sense.\"",
      "He added: \"I've always been strong on humanitarian issues and always will be, and that's me.\"",
      "Lineker said that, following his tweets, \"the goalposts were massively moved because it was never an issue until, suddenly, this point\".",
      "The BBC updated its social media guidance in 2023 following a review that was commissioned in the wake of the fallout over Lineker's tweets.",
      "The corporation said presenters of flagship programmes, such as Match of the Day, \"carry a particular responsibility to respect the BBC's impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC\".",
      "Asked if he understood that his comments gave ammunition to the BBC's critics, Lineker said: \"Yes of course, I understand that, but does it make it wrong what I did? I don't think so. Would I do it if I knew what would've happened and transpired? Of course I wouldn't.\"",
      "Gaza doc",
      "Lineker hit the headlines again recently when he, along with 500 other high-profile figures, signed an open later urging the BBC to reinstate a documentary about Gaza to iPlayer.",
      "The documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from the streaming service in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "Lineker told Rajan he would \"100%\" support the documentary being made available again, arguing: \"I think you let people make their own minds up. We're adults. We're allowed to see things like that. It's incredibly moving.\"",
      "He added that, although the 13-year-old was narrating the programme, the script had \"not been written by [the child], it's been written by the people who produced the show\".",
      "\"I think [the BBC] just capitulated to lobbying that they get a lot,\" he said.",
      "After concerns were raised, the BBC took down the programme while it carried out further due diligence. The matter is currently still being investigated by the corporation.",
      "The BBC said it had identified serious flaws in the making of the documentary. The BBC board said the mistakes were \"significant and damaging\".",
      "Gambling in sport",
      "In the wide-ranging interview, which will be broadcast on Tuesday, Lineker also discussed his footballing career, his son's leukemia battle as a baby, and his views on gambling sponsorship in sports.",
      "Lineker said the football industry should rethink its responsibility when it comes to taking money from gambling firms.",
      "\"I know people [for whom] it becomes an addiction, it can completely destroy their lives,\" he said.",
      "\"There's talk about taking [logos] off the shirts, but you see it on the boards around the ground everywhere.",
      "\"I think football needs a long, hard look at itself about that, I really do.\"",
      "On top of his presenting roles, Lineker is also the co-founder of Goalhanger Podcasts, which make the successful The Rest is History series and its spin-offs about Politics, Football, Entertainment and Money.",
      "The 64-year-old indicated to Rajan his next career move \"won't be more telly\", adding: \"I think I'll step back from that now.",
      "\"I think I'll probably focus more on the podcast world, because it's such a fun business and it's just been so incredible.\"",

      "Knowles, 71, says for now, the children are not too exposed to it.",
      "\"But one day they'll read the ignorance that people put out there about them, the lies and all of that,\" she says. \"And I do worry about that.\"",
      "Despite those pressures, she says Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z - who are notoriously private about their home life - are doing an \"amazing\" job as parents.",
      "\"The truth is they spend abnormal amount of time with their children and they have great relationships with their kids,\" she says.",
      "\"And they're just great parents. I don't think you could ask for better parents.\"",
      "Knowles is speaking to BBC News ahead of the publication of her new memoir, Matriarch.",
      "It covers her childhood in Texas, her daughters' rise to fame and her later years, as a grandmother.",
      "Knowles now has four grandchildren, including Julez Smith, the son of her younger daughter, singer-songwriter Solange. She also considers herself a grandmother to former Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland's children.",
      "She says that she sees all her grandchildren regularly, describing them as \"one of the biggest joys in my life\".",
      "\"[Blue Ivy and I] have a very close bond,\" she says of her eldest granddaughter.",

      "\"She's my beauty guru. She's my manager,\" she says.",
      "I'm intrigued by this, and ask why she calls the 13-year-old her manager.",
      "\"Well, I don't call her my manager. Everybody else calls her my manager, because she's bossy. She's a little Capricorn like me. So we have that bond.\"",
      "Knowles grew up in 50s and 60s Galveston, the youngest of seven.",
      "In her book, she talks about the harassment her family faced, including from the police.",
      "\"There was a lot of racial tension,\" she tells me. \"And I think some things have changed, but I still think that black people are more susceptible to police brutality [and] being stopped.\"",
      "She met her now ex-husband, Mathew Knowles, in Houston and the pair went on to have two daughters, Beyonc\u00e9 in 1981 and Solange five years later.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9, she writes, was \"not an easy baby\". Nursery rhymes did not cut it (\"she cried louder\" to drown out Mary Had A Little Lamb), but jazz music would soothe her.",
      "As a child, Solange was a \u201csocial butterfly\u201d but Beyonc\u00e9 was shy. \"She walked into every classroom trying to be invisible,\" Knowles writes.",
      "She says at the time, her daughters - and all little black girls - were being \"bombarded\" by messages from mainstream culture that they were \"less than\".",
      "But Beyonc\u00e9 was always singing, and Solange's talent emerged early on too.",
      "\"I knew Beyonc\u00e9 had a very beautiful voice, but I didn't know how talented she was until she was seven,\" Knowles tells me.",
      "\"And Solange probably four, because she just grew up around nothing but music and performances. So she was a lot earlier.\"",
      "Knowles is adamant that she didn't push her daughters into the music industry.",
      "\"Absolutely not. This was not my first choice for my girls. They just lived and breathed music,\" she says.",
      "\"It is their decision. They were born to be entertainers.\"",
      "None of them - including Kelly Rowland, who moved in with the family - were very rebellious, she says. All they wanted to do was sing, dance and perform.",
      "\"I wanted them to have that experience of teenage life and going out to parties and having fun, but I had to force them to do that,\" she says.",
      "In the 1990s, the girl group Destiny's Child was formed. It originally comprised Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett, but the final line-up was a trio - Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, and Michelle Williams.",
      "The band achieved worldwide fame with mega hits such as Bills, Bills, Bills, Say My Name and Jumpin', Jumpin'.",

      "Many interpreted that as a reference to her treatment at the 2016 Country Music Awards, where her performance of Daddy Lessons with The Chicks led to a barrage of criticism - and racism - online.",
      "Knowles says Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s childhood, growing up in Texas and spending time in Louisiana, influenced her music.",

      "Teams of two race to get from one part of the world to another with no air travel, no smartphones, no bank cards and a limited cash budget.",
      "After 50 days spent travelling by land and sea from Japan to Indonesia alongside his St Albans schoolfriend Owen Wood, it all came down to a foot race by a beach off the island of Lombok.",
      "The series four finale saw the pair pip mother and daughter duo Eugenie and Isabel by a mere eight minutes to take the title and \u00a320,000 prize pot.",
      "It also saw Alfie catch the travel bug, sending him on his way to a new career as a travel guru and online content creator.",
      "As series five of the show gets underway on Wednesday, BBC News speaks to the 21-year-old about his new life on the road, advice for fellow travellers and tips for this year's contestants on how to win the show.",
      "\"The whole experience [on the show] kind of opened my eyes to real travel,\" Watts tells us over a video call from Portugal, while taking a break from refereeing a football match.",
      "\"I think there are definitely two different types of travel that we're used to in the UK; shallow travel, as I'd call it, where you go on holiday and you see what you want to see and you stay within your comfort zone or hotel.",
      "\"And then I'd say there's real authentic travel whereby you see the world as it actually is.",
      "\"And I've just learned that I actually much prefer the authenticity of places... rather than the weather.\"",
      "Watts's main advice for readers with a similar wanderlust is to consider travelling \"further afield\".",
      "\"Flights to Spain in the summer might be \u00a3300 return, but you are going to be paying extremely high prices for food, accommodation and things like that,\" he notes.",
      "\"Whereas, actually, if you go a little bit further afield, if you try Malaysia, Thailand, even Brazil, for sure the flights might be \u00a3600-700 but when you're actually there, you're spending \u00a320-25 a day maximum.\"",
      "He adds: \"You're helping local people and you're trying something new.\"",
      "Since his big TV win, Watts has been to around 30 countries, including five in one day for a Europe-based online challenge.",
      "Another time he found and boarded the cheapest possible flights he could find online for seven days straight.",
      "And he also returned to Japan to pay a bill he felt he owed for some Kobe beef steaks that were kindly donated to him and Wood for free when they were worried about their budget, as fans of the show will remember. \"That was a really nice moment,\" he says.",
      "Watts likes to travel solo as he enjoys his \"own company\" and doing things on his \"own terms\", while also meeting new people.",
      "He acknowledges that it's not for everyone, and that some people prefer to be away with friends and family, but he wants to encourage would-be travellers to \"throw yourself in\", responsibly.",
      "\"I don't do things that would put me in danger because I think I have a responsibility to the people that follow me,\" he says.",
      "He does admit though that he once ended up in a taxi with an armed government official in Venezuela - a country he travelled to against UK goverment guidance.",
      "\"That was about as wacky as it got.\"",
      "Bucket list",
      "His favourite place he has been on his travels so far is \"without doubt\" Angel Falls in Venezuela, while his favourite country would be a coin flip between Jordan and Malaysia.",
      "One thing he'd still like to tick off his bucket list is visiting the remote island of Tuvalu in the South Pacific Ocean, which sounds like a pitch for a new TV show in itself.",
      "\"It's the least visited country in the world,\" he explains.",
      "\"Only 1,500 people go there every year. It's very difficult to get to, very expensive to get to.\"",
      "As well as becoming far better travelled (and able to offer visa guidance to his followers), the past year has also seen him expand his horizons in other ways; acting as an ambassador for Young Minds UK - a mental health charity for young people - and Winston's Wish - a children and young people's grief charity.",
      "One of the most heart-rending moments of series four was when it was revealed that Watts's mum had died of cancer when he was just a child.",
      "Speaking of his ambassadorial work, he says: \"I love it and I'm so glad that I get to have the opportunity [to help].",
      "\"But internalising it, it can be quite challenging, listening to people's stories.\"",

      "They include ex-spouses Gaz and Yin, and current couple Fin and Sioned, as well as sisters Elizabeth and Letitia, brothers Brian and Melvyn and mother and son duo Caroline and Tom.",
      "The rules, as usual, are no smart phones, no bank cards (just a small cash budget) and no air travel.",
      "Watts thinks it's going to be a \"really tough route\" and a \"topsy-turvy\" series.",
      "\"China is very easy to get around but very hard to communicate,\" he stresses from personal experience. \"And a lot of China doesn't accept cash anymore.\"",
      "His \"number one piece of advice\" for anyone taking part is to learn from his mistakes and take a calculator and a whiteboard. \"We had to borrow notebooks and God knows what else\".",
      "He also suggests hacks like packing \"little travel placards\" with pictures of buses, trains and people on, for ease of communication.",
      "\"I think now there's more and more series, people are watching it and starting to think, 'actually, this is where they're going wrong. This is how we can be creative around it'.",

      "Content creator Bethel Getahun won over insurance agent Messiah Hailemeskel in Latey: Looking for Love - a reality TV show that ignited debates about dating norms in the conservative East African country.",
      "Latey's premise mirrored that of the aforementioned hit US show, The Bachelor (in fact, Latey is Amharic for bachelor/bachelorette).",
      "Ten women had to compete for the affection of Mr Messiah, a 38-year-old Ethiopian-American who grew up and lives in Dallas.",
      "Throughout the series, the women battled it out in boxing matches, basketball contests and even a bizarre task where they had to devise a TV advert for a mattress, \u00e0 la The Apprentice.",
      "Broadcast on YouTube, Latey is a rare dating programme in a country where courtship is traditionally a private affair.",
      "Winning such a ground-breaking show felt \"surreal\", 25-year-old Ms Bethel told the BBC's Focus on Africa podcast. Weeks on from the finale, which racked up more than 620,000 views, her victory still \"feels like a badge of honour\".",
      "Of course, not everyone feels the same way.",
      "\"The concept of a dating show is entirely [a] Western idea,\" says Ethiopian vlogger Semere Kassaye.",
      "\"Dating in Ethiopia has always been a private matter, something that is nurtured carefully and only brought to the attention of family or society when it reaches a level of maturity.\"",
      "Mr Semere, 41, also feels that the show devalues women, treating them as objects to be acquired.",
      "Several viewers voiced the same opinion - one commenter on YouTube wrote: \"Ladies, you are not an object that the one with money can easily pick you up.\"",
      "Another asked: \"Lots of creativity on the production but if it is against the culture, what is the point?\"",
      "Ms Bethel agrees that the concept of women openly competing for a man clashes with Ethiopian traditions, but insists that the show is more than its central premise.",
      "\"The whole point of the show is to represent different kinds of women,\" she says.",
      "\"If you have seen the episodes, you can see every woman in that episode has a lot of different struggles, backgrounds, and all different kinds of stuff that hasn't really been expressed or represented in media in Ethiopia.\"",
      "Arguably, Latey succeeds in this respect. The women - who include hotel managers, flight attendants and accountants - swiftly bond, sharing their personal stories with each other and the viewers.",
      "In one of the more heart-breaking scenes, actress Vivian divulges that she fled to Ethiopia from Eritrea, a neighbouring country that enforces indefinite military conscription for all able-bodied citizens. It has also been widely accused of human rights violations.",
      "Vivian travelled alone to Ethiopia and has not seen her mother in five years.",
      "\"I miss her so much,\" she says tearfully.",
      "Elsewhere, Rahel, a model, explains that she dropped out of school to take on multiple jobs and provide for her siblings, while other women have emotional conversations about grief and their reverence for those who raised them.",
      "By baring these women's realities - and their romantic desires - Latey cemented its place as the \"content of its times\", producer Metasebia Yoseph tells the BBC.",
      "Ms Metasebia, co-founder of D!nkTV, Latey's production company, says the show \"rocked the boat\", but is far from an affront to Ethiopian culture.",
      "\"Number one - it is not hyper-sexualised,\" she says.",
      "\"We leave it on the more innocent, get-to-know-you, stages of dating.\"",
      "She says the show also asks its viewers to interrogate the concept of culture, \"sparking dialogue about 'What is our culture? Are we a monolith?'\"",
      "Adapting a universal reality TV formula to Ethiopia has delighted many, with one fan commenting: \"I totally love the risk-taking, considering how reserved we are as a society... I have always wanted to see other shows in Ethiopian version. This is a ground-breaking moment.\"",
      "A second viewer wrote: \"I never imagined watching The Bachelor in Ethiopia, but you have done an excellent job bringing it to life.\"",
      "Off the back of this success, D!nk TV is planning a second series.",
      "This time, Ms Metasebia says, a single woman could be the one picking her match from 10 male hopefuls.",
      "\"We're getting a lot of feedback from the audience, people want to see the roles reversed,\" she explains.",
      "As for Ms Bethel and Mr Messiah? Sadly, their love story has come to a halt.",
      "\"It is long distance because he's in America right now with his son. So it's really difficult... I don't know where it's going to go, basically,\" she says.",
      "But Ms Bethel is still close to some of her fellow contestants, who she fondly refers to as her \"sorority\".",
      "She is proud that Latey showcased \"the romantic side of Ethiopia\" and believes the show will lead to better representations of women in Ethiopian media.",
      "\"It is a new way of showcasing women and how they express themselves,\" she says.",
      "\"It is a new way of seeing.\"",

      "Artists and critics predicted last year Cowboy Carter could \"open the floodgates\" for country music fans and Spotify credits \"viral tracks\" from 2024 with the sudden uptick in streams.",

    "story": [
      "Supported housing, which helps vulnerable or disabled people live independently, is in crisis, an open letter signed by more than 170 organisations in the sector claims.",
      "Services at one in three providers in England had to shut last year, adding to a total shortfall of about 325,000 places, says the letter, which will be delivered to Prime Minister Keir Starmer today. Signatories to it include Refuge, Age UK and the National Housing Federation (NHF).",
      "Blaming cuts to council funding and rising costs, the NHF says a further one in three providers fear they may close unless the government pledges more money.",
      "The government says supported housing is vital and it is focused on building more homes.",
      "About half a million people in the UK currently live in supported housing, including young care leavers, army veterans, people with learning disabilities and those escaping homelessness or domestic abuse.",
      "\"Supported housing plays an indispensable role in cutting NHS waiting list backlogs, and reducing pressure on social care, temporary accommodation, and other vital public services,\" the open letter says.",
      "However, it says the future of supported housing is now at risk following \"years of funding cuts\" and that local authorities have now been forced to \"decommission vital services\".",
      "\"Rising costs alongside reduced funding have rendered many services unviable, forcing many to close, while demand for supported housing continues to rise. The decision to increase employers' National Insurance contributions has placed even further pressure on providers' budgets.\"",
      "The organisations are calling for long-term increased funding for housing-related support of at least \u00a31.6bn per year for councils and for supported homes to be among the 1.5 million new houses planned by the government.",
      "\"We recognise the vital role played by supported housing in helping vulnerable people to live independently and well, and the contribution it makes to tackling rough sleeping and timely hospital discharge,\" a spokesperson for the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said.",
      "The spokesperson said the government was putting \u00a32bn into increasing social and affordable housebuilding in 2026-27, with further details to be set out in a long-term housing strategy later this year.",
      "Proponents of austerity measures say tough funding choices need to be made to balance the UK's finances.",
      "However, Shaoxiong Liu says his family do not know what they would have done without a supported housing place for his son Jason.",
      "Aged 39, Jason has autism, a learning disability and mental health challenges. As he grew older, this became increasingly unmanageable for his family. After falling ill, Jason was admitted to hospital with sepsis in 2017.",
      "Due to his challenging behaviour and a condition that induces severe vomiting, he remained in hospital for months as they struggled to find somewhere long term that could accommodate his needs.",
      "He was eventually placed with Advance Housing, where his family says Jason has flourished in the intervening eight years. His weight has risen from 35kg to 53kg, he can go on bus trips and attends social events organised by the housing provider.",
      "\"Jason's behaviour is so much better now. He's lived there so long and he's happy there,\" Mr Liu says. \"Jason is an adult now and we are in our 70s, so his behaviour could be quite dangerous for us if he lived with us - we couldn't look after him.\"",
      "The NHF says one in three providers in England it surveyed say they may have to stop providing services altogether, meaning the loss of 70,000 supported homes across the country.",
      "In 2009, ringfenced council funding for housing-related support was removed. When council budgets were cut during austerity from 2010, funding was needed in other areas, meaning some councils had to cut supported housing services.",
      "The NHF says that means there are now fewer supported homes than in 2007, including a net loss of 3,000 supported homes in the last three years. It calculates there is a total shortfall of up to 325,000 supported homes, based on unmet need.",

    "story": [
      "Chris Brookes-Smith, 28, used to live in fear of dying from eating even the smallest trace of peanut.",
      "Ten years ago he had his worst allergic reaction after ordering a curry at a local Indian takeaway. The trauma of it is seared into his memory.",
      "\"I knew I was in trouble after one bite,\" he says. \"Within seconds there were spots on my lips. Within minutes I was vomiting. I could feel my throat closing up, hives forming in my armpits then over my whole body... My face going all puffy with the swelling.\"",
      "His voice tails off, full of emotion.",
      "\"I thought I was going to die.\"",
      "Photos taken in hospital later that day show the toll the reaction took on his body.",
      "\"I looked like a plucked turkey because my skin had blistered so much,\" Chris says.",
      "But the most painful thing were the hives - red, raised bumps on the skin - which felt \"like boiling water had been poured over me\".",
      "Trying to avoid peanuts, one of the most common food allergies, has been a way of life for Chris and millions of other adults with a serious allergy. Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety.",
      "As many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse.",
      "An allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals. Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious.",
      "Chris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches.",
      "Each reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day \"on high alert hoping nothing bad happens\".",
      "Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences.",
      "Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy.",
      "As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life.",
      "It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react.",
      "Despite being \"really nervous\", Chris agreed to sign up.",
      "From milligrams to whole nuts",
      "Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts.",
      "By the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris.",
      "Professor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment \"has potential to have a real impact on patients' lives\".",
      "\"Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that.",
      "\"They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now.\"",
      "The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostly in children whose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift.",
      "\"Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away,\" says Prof Till. \"Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too.\"",
      "This trial, published in the journal Allergy, shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times.",
      "Chris, who lives in Northamptonshire, had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut. Increasing that dose - willingly - every day was something he couldn't imagine.",
      "\"The first time I went there and I ingest this stuff, my heart's going a million miles an hour,\" he says. \"The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut.\"",
      "But he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction.",
      "\"You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen.\"",
      "However, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring.",
      "'Wonderful feeling'",
      "Not everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is.",
      "\"For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step,\" explains Prof Till. \"But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future.\"",
      "Being able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food.",
      "How to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people.",
      "And researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result.",
      "Chris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay \u2013 as recommended by his doctors.",
      "He's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment.",
      "While he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into \"nuclear meltdown\" has changed his life.",

      "Extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff poses a significant risk to patients, England's NHS safety watchdog warns.",
      "The Health Services Safety Investigations Body said medication errors, impaired decision-making, reduced attention and rude and disrespectful behaviour were the most common problems associated with fatigued staff in hospitals.",
      "It said there was limited data on the scale of the problem, but cited evidence from staff surveys and information provided by safety experts that it was a contributory factor in safety incidents.",
      "In its report, the watchdog gave examples of mistakes being made with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs.",
      "In one case a mother and baby were harmed after an inaccurate scan, with the staff member saying fatigue and workload contributed.",
      "In the chemotherapy case the staff were nearly nine hours into a 12.5-hour day shift and had only managed five to six hours of sleep between shifts and had limited breaks because of staffing pressures.",
      "The hospital investigation found fatigue was \"likely to have been a factor\".",
      "Sleep-deprived",
      "Some staff reported being sleep-deprived on a daily basis.",
      "And one doctor told the watchdog: \"When it gets to that third day of doing these 12-hour nights it's dangerous from 2am onwards... do I have the energy or the brain space or the mental space to even make a life-changing decision for a patient at this point?\"",
      "The watchdog said exhaustion was also a risk to staff themselves with some complaining of nodding off at the wheel on the way home and reports of staff dying in road accidents after work.",
      "Shift work, long working hours, lack of breaks, caring responsibilities and financial pressures were all cited as factors in staff fatigue.",
      "The watchdog said the issue was often misunderstood in the NHS and thought of more as a wellbeing issue rather than a safety issue.",
      "It said the government and NHS England needed to introduce better systems to monitor fatigue and work with unions and employers to raise awareness about it.",
      "Support available",
      "Senior safety investigator Saskia Fursland said: \"Fatigue is more than just being tired - it can significantly impair decision-making, motor skills, and alertness.",
      "\"We must move away from viewing fatigue as an individual issue and putting the onus on personal responsibility and instead treat it as a system-level risk that deserves urgent attention.\"",
      "Dr Latifa Patel, of the British Medical Association, said the findings were concerning, but not surprising with doctors facing long shifts back-to-back with little respite.",
      "She said there needed to be better rota design to ensure staff could rest properly between shifts and improved rest facilities in hospitals.",
      "But she said fatigue was also \"often driven by workforce shortages\" too.",
      "A spokesperson for NHS England said it recognised staff were at risk of burnout and was \"committed\" to ensuring they got the support they needed to provide safe care.",
      "\"Staff should always feel confident to report patient safety concerns, including those that are linked to fatigue, and we will work with local NHS systems to address any issues,\" he added.",
      "He said the NHS was offering more flexible working options than ever before and there was a range of mental health support available for staff.",

    "story": [
      "More than six million illegal vaping products have been seized by Trading Standards officers across England in the past three years, new analysis by the BBC has found. We joined one of the teams responsible for tracking down the illicit goods as they prepare for a ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes.",
      "Paul Leighton is packing his rucksack with a heavy-duty hammer, pry bar and evidence bags for what he describes as \"just an average day out\".",
      "As the senior Trading Standards officer at Newcastle City Council, he has learned the hiding places used to conceal illegal vapes can be sophisticated. Sometimes, he has to force his way in.",
      "He has found them hidden everywhere from inside fridges and barbecues to behind fake fuse boxes and tiled panels complete with hydraulic lifts.",
      "\"I've seen entire kitchens come away from walls and off the floor as well\u2026 so all sorts of hiding places,\" he says.",
      "Classified as illicit or non-compliant vapes, the products he will be searching for today fail to meet the legal requirements for sale in the UK.",
      "More than six million of them were seized in England between 2022 and 2024, according to analysis by the BBC.",
      "The health risks posed to unwitting customers are summed up by Connor Lamb, a senior technician for licensing also taking part in the unannounced checks on shops.",
      "If you get a normal vape, he says, \"they've got a capacity which is enough for 600 puffs - the equivalent to 20 cigarettes\".",
      "But if you get an illegal one, \"it can be anything from 200 cigarettes in one vape. Obviously someone buying this to go on a night out or a kid might just be chuffing on it all day and you can imagine the drastic effect that'll have on someone's lungs.\"",
      "According to Trading Standards, illicit or non-compliant vapes can be anything with tank sizes greater than 2ml, a nicotine strength of more than 20ml or labels that do not display manufacturer details and health warnings.",
      "The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency strongly advises consumers not to use them as the true content - and any possible health risk - is unknown.",
      "On the road, Paul and Connor quickly find a stash of between 12 and 20 packs of illegal vapes at the back of a shop counter.",
      "\"It would be unusual to have so few in a shop that sells quite frequently like this, so it's just a case of where they're hiding the rest,\" says Paul.",
      "We head to a room at the back of the shop. There is a stench of urine. It is full of litter and we are deep in seemingly empty cardboard boxes.",
      "Paul's hunch is proven right though as a search among the rubbish unearths a box of illegal vapes.",
      "How widespread are illegal vapes?",
      "Of 136 local Trading Standards bodies in England, 133 responded to BBC Freedom of Information requests, showing that between 2022 and 2024:",
      "At least 6,169,822 illicit or non-compliant vaping products were seized, including those taken at ports as well as in shopsThere were 3,766 records of retailers selling vapes to children making test purchases, with some retailers potentially caught more than onceRetailers were recorded 7,594 times as selling illicit or non-compliant vapes on test purchases",

      "There were 3,766 records of retailers selling vapes to children making test purchases, with some retailers potentially caught more than once",
      "Retailers were recorded 7,594 times as selling illicit or non-compliant vapes on test purchases",
      "Selling illegal vapes was a factor in at least 316 shop closures during that period, while selling to children was a factor in at least 67. Most of the closures were temporary and some retailers may have been shut down more than once.",
      "The Independent British Vape Trade Association (IBVTA) insists the majority of vape shops operate within the law, serving adults who would otherwise be smoking.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"These business owners would never knowingly involve themselves in criminal activity. Rather, it is since the resurgence of popularity of single-use vapes, and therefore a popular 'cash market', that we've seen organised crime gangs get involved in importing and distributing vapes.\"",
      "They said IBVTA had long called for greater enforcement action at borders to stem the flow of illegal products entering the country.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said it was allocating an extra \u00a310m this financial year for Trading Standards to tackle underage and illicit sales, with an expected 80 additional apprentice enforcement officers to be funded.",
      "Paul and Connor agree single-use vapes are among the main driving forces of the illegal trade and hope the coming ban will improve the situation.",
      "\"These are quite sophisticated networks that we're up against who are also involved in lots of quite serious activities as well as modern day slavery, trafficking, drug supply,\" says Paul.",
      "\"I think we'll see a lot less product taken off the street because we haven't really had a massive issue with reusable vapes for quite some time.",
      "\"They've always been broadly compliant in terms of the devices that are being used, the batteries, the liquids, the odd oversized tank here.\"",
      "When does the disposable vapes ban start?",
      "From 1 June, it will be illegal for businesses in the UK to sell, supply or possess single-use vapes for sale.",
      "Those caught doing so will get a \u00a3200 on-the-spot fine in the first instance, rising to an unlimited fine and/or a prison sentence of up to two years for repeat offences.",
      "The government has said Trading Standards will be able to keep the full value of the on-the-spot fines, to reinvest into enforcement.",
      "Extra enforcement powers and funding are something IBVTA says it welcomes, noting \"not all Trading Standards teams are equally or adequately resourced\" and \"some areas with low regulatory compliance are unable to carry out the enforcement they would want to\".",
      "But a national spokesperson for Trading Standards said its work was \"definitely having an impact\".",
      "Government funding had enabled \"extra boots on the ground\" at Heathrow Airport and Dover Port, the spokesperson said, which explained the high number of seizures by the local authorities home to those border points \u2013 Hillingdon and Kent.",
      "In Hillingdon alone, 2,099,248 vaping products were seized between 2022-2024, making up a third of the total.",
      "They said Salford was home to a number of vape warehouses supplying products across England, meaning \"seizing at this stage in the supply chain is really effective\".",
      "However, they said there was still a \"huge challenge in terms of retailers prepared to sell illegal products as well as those who persistently sell to children\".",
      "Back in Newcastle, Paul offers a similar assessment of the task faced nationally.",
      "He estimates the number of illegal vapes still circulating in the country is \"easily in the millions at the moment\", adding: \"It's a constant battle trying to make a difference.\"",

      "Behind the different responses lie many of the often bitter and vitriolic arguments that set the country on a long, tricky road towards Wednesday's unambiguous judgement.",
      "When the highest court in the land ruled that sex is binary - meaning legally it should be interpreted as referring to either a biological man or a biological woman - it was providing clarity that had been missing from such conversations for years.",
      "Words like \"woman\"\u202fand \"sex\"\u202fhad become loaded with different meanings depending on your viewpoint. Language that for centuries had been uncomplicated and accepted, became a battleground.",

      "It argues that for the Equality Act to be consistent, the term woman has to mean a biological woman. That does not include biological males, even if they have certificates to say they have changed gender.",
      "This means that where there are, for instance, women-only spaces, then a biological man who identifies as a woman cannot use them. That includes changing rooms, toilets, women's refuges, single-sex hospital wards and anywhere designated as for one sex only.",

      "The second response to the judgement was from the trans rights campaign group TransActual, which described the Supreme Court judgement as devastating.",
      "One of its activists, Jane Fae, told the BBC the judgement felt like a physical body blow, and that it was as if trans people were being excluded from society.",
      "\"Today we're feeling very alone\" she said. \"What does this mean - can I use this loo, can I do that, can I do the other?\"",
      "In contrast, the women's groups who fought the case feel vindicated and jubilant.",
      "Helen Joyce, the director of advocacy at the campaign group Sex Matters, says the ruling is \"incredibly\u202fimportant for the half of humanity who need single-sex spaces\".",
      "Women's groups argue that the ruling is important for reasons of privacy, safety, dignity and discrimination.",
      "The Supreme Court case was brought by a group called For Women Scotland. It wanted to overturn Scottish legislation which said 50% of members on public boards should be women - and trans women were included in their definition.",
      "The group lost its case in Scotland's highest court but appealed to the UK Supreme Court. The case was heard towards the end of last year.",
      "\"What we wanted was clarity in the law - when something is described as a single-sex service, a single-sex space, that this relates to biology,\" Susan Smith from For Women Scotland told the BBC.",
      "Beginnings of the culture wars",
      "Over time the arguments over how a woman is defined had become increasingly angry, bitter and divided, because the stakes were high for all involved.",
      "For transgender people, who say they often face victimisation and harassment, the battles were rooted in attempts to win better legal protection.",
      "\"Legal gender recognition is essential for trans people to enjoy the full spectrum of rights each of us is entitled to, including safety, health and family life,\" according to Sacha Deshmukh, the chief executive of Amnesty International UK. \u202fThe charity opposed For Women Scotland's case in the Supreme Court.",
      "The question of how to achieve legal recognition rose to prominence in 2002 when two judgements at the European Court of Human Rights found the UK was breaching human rights by failing to legally recognise transgender people in their acquired gender.",
      "This eventually led to the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, which allowed a trans person to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC).\u202fThis recognised their preferred gender rather than their biological sex, allowing official documents like birth certificates to be changed to reflect that.",
      "But\u202fit was a long-winded process requiring two doctors to sign it off and for the person to \"live\u202fin their acquired gender\" for at least two years. Only about 8,000 people have applied for a GRC since they came into being, according to government figures.",
      "Campaigners began calling for the process to be simplified. In a response to a 2020 government consultation on amending the GRA, Stonewall, the LGBTQ+ rights organisation, called for a \"move\u202fto a de-medicalised and straightforward legal gender recognition process\".",
      "Gradually these calls gained momentum.",
      "In 2022, the Scottish government introduced a law that would allow people to \"self-identify\"\u202fin their desired gender. This was later blocked by the UK government and eventually dropped as a Scottish policy.",
      "As the rights of trans people were being debated, women's groups started pushing back about what that meant for biological women.",
      "The meaning of words like \"woman\"\u202fand \"sex\"\u202ftook on new significance, if someone who was biologically male had a certificate that identified them as a woman for legal purposes.",
      "Under the 2010 Equality Act, sex was a protected characteristic, and so was gender reassignment. With the very meaning of those categories in dispute, legal experts said it set the protections of one group against the protections of another.",
      "The complexities mean courts and tribunals have frequently been called on to arbitrate.",
      "And social media has often provided a starting point for angry disputes, connecting and amplifying voices, and in many cases, leading to more entrenched viewpoints.  It had become a culture war.",
      "How the debate began to change",
      "In 2019, tax expert Maya Forstater lost her job because she tweeted that she did not believe people could change their sex. She said biological sex was immutable and not the same as gender identity.",
      "As a result, her work contract was not renewed. Her employer said it wanted to build an inclusive workplace.",
      "She lost her case at an employment tribunal case, but an Appeal Court judge later ruled that gender critical beliefs were protected by the Equalities Act. In 2023, she was awarded \u00a3100,000 compensation for unfair dismissal.",
      "It was a high-profile battle through tribunals and courts which put employers' policies on inclusion under the spotlight and raised questions about whether by protecting the rights of one group, another was being discriminated against.",
      "Ms Forstater went on to set up the campaign group Sex Matters, and\u202fwas among those celebrating outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday.",
      "There have been other similar cases brought against employers since then. Sex Matters lists 11 settled or ongoing cases on its website.",
      "But other high-profile cases have also shaped the broader debate.",
      "In March 2020, 23-year-old Keira Bell took legal action against the only children's NHS gender clinic, saying she should have been challenged more by medical staff over her decision to transition to a male whilst a teenager.",
      "Although she eventually lost her case, it started a chain reaction, which led to a shake-up of gender services for children and young people.",
      "And in 2021 the Sussex University professor, Kathleen Stock, quit her job after being accused of having transphobic views. She had published a book that questioned whether gender identity was more significant than biological sex.",
      "She denied being transphobic but was subjected to a student campaign to remove her from her post.\u202fThe university was later fined for failing to uphold freedom of speech.",
      "These and other cases put an uncomfortable spotlight on a debate that many preferred to ignore or dismiss as mainly happening on social media, because it was too tricky and using the wrong language could lead to abuse.",
      "Yet fundamental questions were being raised about freedom of speech, how we treat each other and how you define a woman. The need for clarity had become overwhelming.",
      "In terms of equality law, the Supreme Court ruling provided that.",
      "For women's groups there is sheer relief that biological facts will now drive decisions.",
      "But for many trans people there is distress. Even though they still have protections under the Equality Act, for many it does not feel like that.  They worry that harassment will increase.",
      "Activist\u202fCharlie Craggs,\u202fwho is a trans woman,\u202ftold the BBC it was\u202freally sad that this tiny community of less than 1% of the population was being \"thrown under the bus\".",
      "Supreme Court ruling in practice",
      "Crucially, the ruling provides a clear framework for what equality laws mean. The EHRC says it is \"working\u202fat pace\" to update its guidance, and expects that to be ready by the summer.",
      "It has already made it clear that if a single-sex space, like a toilet or changing room, is women-only, that means biological males who identify as women should not use it.",
      "It says instead that trans people should use their \"powers\u202fof advocacy\" to campaign for third spaces, such as unisex toilets.",
      "And it has said it will pursue the NHS if it does not follow the latest ruling.",
      "Health service guidance on single-sex wards currently says that \"trans people\u202fshould be accommodated according to their presentation, the way they dress, and the name and pronouns they currently use\".",
      "Currently this allows trans women to be offered beds on women-only wards.",
      "The NHS says its policy is under review.",
      "Former Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption says that while the ruling means organisations can exclude trans women from women only facilities, they are not necessarily obliged to do so.",
      "He told Radio 4's PM programme that in sport, for example, it would be down to individual governing bodies to decide who is allowed to compete in women's sport.",
      "\"They could decide to allow trans women to compete on the same basis as biological women, some sporting authorities do, although I think that in light of the latest judgement, they would be wise to say so expressly in their rules,\" he said.",
      "British Transport Police has been the first body to actually change its policies. It says strip searches of people in custody will be carried out by officers of the same biological sex",
      "It means a trans woman would be searched by a male officer, and a police officer who is a trans woman would not be able to search a biological woman.",
      "The domestic violence charity Refuge says the ruling will not change the way it operates.",
      "Its chief executive, Gemma Sherrington, says, \"we remain firmly committed to supporting all survivors of domestic abuse, including trans women\".",
      "But for many businesses, sports clubs and other organisations it is too soon to know what this will mean in practice.",
      "They will need to see the detailed guidance from the Equality Commission first. Until then it is difficult to know how much change, if any, they will need to make or what new issues might arise.",
      "Some organisations will also have to decide whether they have the space and money to provide so-called third spaces or unisex facilities",
      "For trans people there is also a lot of uncertainty. They will have been used to using spaces which correspond to their gender identity - changing that may be difficult and, for some, frightening.",

    "published": "Sun, 20 Apr 2025 00:04:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Blind influencer Lucy Edwards on choosing IVF which will screen out the gene that made her who she is.",
    "story": [
      "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.",
      "\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.",
      "Lucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.",
      "Lucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.",
      "The condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.",
      "Lucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.",
      "The abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.",
      "\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.",
      "This is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.",
      "Without medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.",
      "She pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"",
      "And that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.",
      "It is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.",
      "In 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.",
      "It is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.",
      "\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\"",
      "Lucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.",
      "She says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.",
      "\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"",
      "IP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.",
      "\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"",
      "In response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.",
      "But Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.",
      "\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.",
      "\"I'm going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient.\"",
      "Lucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl... series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves.",
      "NHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.",
      "\"I need to be a BMI of 30 and I'm very open that I need to lose 9kg,\" Lucy says. \"I've already lost 15kg.\"",
      "Her health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.",
      "\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"",
      "Once she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.",
      "She will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.",
      "Over a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.",
      "Meanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.",
      "The embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.",
      "Lucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.",
      "\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"",
      "A few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit.",
      "\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.",
      "\"Fingers crossed [we're] only a few weeks away from ringing the clinic.\"",

      "Rachel Reeves suggested that moving closer to the EU on trade was a bigger priority, despite her current focus on talks with the US.",
      "After her meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday, Reeves tweeted that both the UK and US want a deal that is \"in both our national interests\".",
      "Earlier this week, she signalled the UK could lower tariffs on US car imports from their current 10% to 2.5% as part of a wider deal.",
      "The UK is preparing for a summit with the EU in May in an attempt to \"reset\" the relationship between the two.",
      "\"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told the BBC.",

      "Despite successfully growing her business in Hornchurch, in East London, over three decades, the 50-year-old says she now faces losing her life's work and her home.",
      "Tax rises in October's Budget are \"crippling\" her salon business, she said, and the extra \u00a323,000 a year imposed by the chancellor could prove the final nail in the coffin.",
      "\"I have been crying myself to sleep because, since October, this has been the worst period of my personal life in 30 years,\" she said.",
      "\"I feel ashamed to get into debt but we are gradually eating through our business reserves and I can't take wages if I don't make a profit.",
      "\"I could lose my house if the business folds - that is the reality and if things don't change it is frightening the life out of me.\"",
      "'I don't have the margin to invest in apprentices'",
      "'Perfect storm' could see end of salon apprenticeships",
      "'We're always hammered' - Beauty industry ahead of budget",
      "The government says the tax changes announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves were needed to stabilise the economy.",
      "They say their plan to reform business rates will mean lower taxes for High Street businesses such as hair salons when it comes into effect in 2026-27.",
      "But salon owners fear this may come too late to save their businesses.",
      "Cutting a client's hair, Kerry explained she could not afford to take on any new apprentices this year and had been forced to reduce the hours of her current 12 apprentices to the minimum.",
      "The next step will be to halve the number of apprentices over the next year as their contracts finish, ending up with six by the end of this year.",
      "If the business cannot recover over the next four years, the rest of her 28 staff, who are nearly all local women who became stylists after serving an apprenticeship at the salon, are facing potential redundancy.",
      "\"I'm having to drastically reduce my overall employee numbers to cut costs just to survive,\" she said.",
      "\"Where are the future hairdressers going to come from if good, employed salons go out of business?\"",
      "Kerry added the way the chancellor is treating salons, which overwhelmingly employ women, \"totally goes against the objectives of the government\" in growing the economy and supporting workers.",
      "Part of the pressure is coming from the UK's Value Added Tax (VAT) rules, which do not allow businesses to reclaim tax on staff costs in the same way they can for goods, putting labour-intensive businesses such as hair or beauty salons at a disadvantage.",
      "\"If you look at a cafe, one waiter can serve several tables of four customers in the space of an hour and the cafe can reclaim the VAT on all the food and drink they serve,\" Kerry explained.",
      "\"Whereas one salon customer needs attention from the receptionist, the apprentice for hair-washing, and the stylist in that same hour and we can only claim VAT back on a tube of hair colour.\"",
      "Many hairdressers went into debt due to the pandemic, said Kerry, and the added pressures of increases in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and business rates are now threatening the future of salons across the country.",
      "For Kerry's salon, the Vanilla Rooms, the tax increases have added a \"devastating\" \u00a323,000 extra to her annual costs, through a combination of the threshold at which employers start to pay Nics on staff wages being lowered to \u00a35,000 and changes to business rates.",
      "Her Nics costs have risen 29%, from \u00a342,000 to about \u00a354,500 - now costing more than \u00a31,000 a week  - and business rates have gone up by 144%, from \u00a3700 to \u00a318,000 a year.",
      "Kerry is one of 50,000 UK hairdressing professionals represented by the British Hair Consortium (BHC), which has urged Rachel Reeves to take action or face the \"collapse\" of the industry due to rising costs.",
      "The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs.",
      "The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market.",
      "Kerry's case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament's Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector.",
      "Lopez,  the MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, said Kerry was not alone in being forced to consider whether she will have to shut up shop completely.",
      "\"Some the increased bills for salons are just unbelievable,\" she said, adding that women were disproportionately impacted by the changes.",
      "\"It's hard to ignore the impact, let alone the irony, of a chancellor celebrating herself for being the first woman to hold that office while simultaneously hammering the sectors that employ, serve and are often led, by women.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Gibson agreed that Reeves' Budget had implemented \"an unfair tax on jobs\" and the government must offer tax relief for small businesses in June.",
      "Gibson said an increasing number of salons are opting to rent chairs out to self-employed staff, instead of employing stylists directly, to avoid paying tax.",
      "\"If salons don't get support we will see a huge increase in people becoming chair renters,\" she said, which reduces the Treasury's overall tax take.",
      "Responding for the Labour government, Small Business Minister Gareth Thomas defended the chancellor's decisions in her October Budget as \"important for long term stability\".",
      "Salons are \"a vital pillar of our high streets\", he said, adding \"many hair and beauty businesses will benefit from some of the other measures the chancellor introduced\".",
      "\"We increased the employment allowance so that almost one million employers pay no national insurance contributions at all.",
      "More than half of employers will see no change or gain from that package, and that includes many hair and beauty businesses,\" he told MPs.",

      "The culture secretary has said the BBC's licence fee is \"unenforceable\" and insisted \"no options are off the table\" when the government begins a review into the corporation's current funding model later this year.",
      "In an interview with the Telegraph, Lisa Nandy said there were \"problems\" with the annual charge, with \"fewer and fewer people\" paying the \u00a3174.50 fee.",
      "The charter, which expires in 2027 and is under review, is an agreement between the BBC and the government that sets out the terms and purposes of the corporation - including the existence of the licence fee.",
      "A BBC spokeswoman said the broadcaster looks forward to engaging with the government and securing the long-term future of the BBC.",
      "Nandy has already started negotiations with the BBC about the corporation's funding.",
      "It currently gets most of its income from the licence fee - in the last financial year, the BBC received \u00a33.7bn, or about two-thirds of its total income, from it.",
      "\"We're open to a different system,\" she told the Telegraph, but admitted no preferred options had been put forward yet.",
      "She added the government wanted the public's input in shaping the new model to create \"a fairer, more sustainable system\".",
      "According to the BBC, 80% of households currently pay the licence fee.",
      "Nandy also said she had been \"very concerned\" about the way the fee had been enforced in the past as it had been found to disproportionately target women.",
      "Two BBC reviews found the gender disparity had been due to societal factors.",
      "The review in 2017 detailed a gender skew towards women-only households, a greater likelihood of women answering the door to TV Licensing Enquiry Officers and a higher chance of them engaging positively with an officer.",
      "In 2023, the BBC set out plans to reduce the high proportion of women being prosecuted for licence fee evasion, after figures showed that they made up 76% of the 52,376 people convicted over it in 2020.",
      "Nandy has previously said the charge was \"deeply regressive\" and that she was thinking \"quite radically and creatively\" about alternatives. But the minister has ruled out using general taxation to fund the BBC.",
      "She did, however, keep open the possibility of a subscription model.",
      "Last month in a Sunday Times interview, the corporation's chairman suggested wealthier households could be charged more.",
      "A BBC spokeswoman said: \"The public cares about the BBC and we have launched our biggest ever public engagement exercise, so audiences can help drive and shape what they want from a universal and independent BBC in the future.",

    "summary": "An agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations for a post-Brexit \"reset\".",
    "story": [
      "The government is no longer ruling out a youth visa deal with the EU, ahead of a summit next month to \"reset\" relations after Brexit.",
      "Labour has previously said it has \"no plans\" for such a scheme, which would make it easier for young people to study and work abroad.",
      "But an agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations between the two sides to boost co-operation. Downing Street declined to repeat its previous opposition to reporters on Thursday, saying it would not provide a \"running commentary\" on talks.",
      "It comes as over 60 Labour MPs called on ministers to strike a \"new and bespoke youth visa scheme for UK and EU citizens aged under 30\".",
      "Five key impacts of Brexit five years on",
      "EU chief 'surprised' at fish status in Brexit talks",
      "In a letter to EU relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds, they argued a mutual deal for time-limited visas, subject to a cap, would \"extend new cultural, educational, and economic opportunities to young people in the UK\".",
      "Sir Keir Starmer met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later, as preparations increase for the summit in London on 19 May.",
      "Following the meeting, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"Discussing the ongoing negotiations to strengthen the UK-EU partnership, they both agreed that good progress had been made.",
      "\"They asked their teams to continue their important work in the coming weeks, with the aim of delivering as ambitious a package as possible at the first UK-EU summit next month.\"",
      "The Labour government is aiming to forge closer economic ties to the EU after Brexit. Both sides have also expressed a renewed interest in a defence and security pact amid the war in Ukraine.",
      "A defence deal would potentially unlock full UK access to a \u20ac150bn (\u00a3128bn) EU-backed loans scheme, with British firms otherwise limited to providing up to 35% of the value of projects funded under the programme.",
      "Speaking at UK Trade and Business Commission meeting on Thursday, Germany's ambassador to the UK Miguel Berger said he wanted to see progress on a youth visa deal as part of a \"package approach\" to the talks, where different topics are linked together.",
      "He added that EU citizens had faced \"many obstacles\" to moving to the UK since Brexit, including \"very high thresholds\" for skilled work visas.",
      "Existing schemes",
      "The UK currently offers visas allowing young people from 12 non-EU countries including Japan, South Korea and Uruguay to study or work in the UK for up to two years. Those from Australia, Canada or New Zealand can extend by a further year.",
      "These visas are subject to annual quotas, ranging from 100 visas for Andorra to 42,000 for Australia, with ballots held where they are oversubscribed.",
      "Applicants from these countries need at least \u00a32,530 in savings, cannot apply for most benefits, and have to pay an annual NHS surcharge of \u00a3776 for students and \u00a31,035 for workers.",
      "The European Commission first suggested an EU-wide youth deal in April last year, claiming Rishi Sunak's government had approached European capitals to discuss individual visa deals, risking \"differential treatment\" of EU citizens.",
      "Under its original proposal, people aged between 18 and 30 would be able to apply for visas lasting up to four years to work, study, train or volunteer, with no overall cap on the number of visas issued.",
      "It also said EU applicants should not have to pay the NHS surcharge, and should be able to pay the same university tuition fees as British students, rather than the higher fees they have had to pay since Brexit.",
      "'Youth experience'",
      "There have been suggestions that the Home Office, tasked with delivering government plans to lower overall migration, is pushing for any eventual agreement to be more limited than that suggested by the European Commission.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is reportedly arguing for visas to be limited to one year so that EU citizens taking part do not show up in official immigration figures, with applications also subject to an overall cap.",
      "Asked about the reports, Mr Berger declined to comment, saying that \"we have to leave that to the negotiations\".",
      "The EU has been keen to stress that a visa deal would not replicate the bloc's rules on freedom of movement, under which EU citizens were automatically entitled to live and work in the UK without applying for a visa.",
      "Documents circulated between EU states also suggest a deal could be rebranded as a \"youth experience\" scheme, in an apparent bid to downplay any link to migration.",
      "But any deal that is negotiated is likely to lead to a political row, with the Conservatives and Reform UK critical of a proposed agreement.",
      "During a local election campaign visit earlier, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said a deal risked \"another avenue which people might use to game the system,\" adding that Labour \"doesn't know how to negotiate\".",
      "She added: \"Where are all these people they want to bring in going to work?\"",
      "Reform leader Nigel Farage said a deal could lead to a \"huge number of people\" coming to the UK, adding it would be \"completely against what the Brexit vote demanded\".",
      "An agreement has however been strongly supported by the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, which have long been calling on the Labour government to reach an agreement with the EU.",
      "In his comments on Thursday, Mr Berger insisted a deal would have \"nothing to do with migration\" as those taking part in the scheme would \"go home\" once their visa has ended."

      "Services at one in three providers in England had to shut last year, adding to a total shortfall of about 325,000 places, says the letter, which will be delivered to Prime Minister Keir Starmer today. Signatories to it include Refuge, Age UK and the National Housing Federation (NHF).",
      "Blaming cuts to council funding and rising costs, the NHF says a further one in three providers fear they may close unless the government pledges more money.",
      "The government says supported housing is vital and it is focused on building more homes.",
      "About half a million people in the UK currently live in supported housing, including young care leavers, army veterans, people with learning disabilities and those escaping homelessness or domestic abuse.",
      "\"Supported housing plays an indispensable role in cutting NHS waiting list backlogs, and reducing pressure on social care, temporary accommodation, and other vital public services,\" the open letter says.",
      "However, it says the future of supported housing is now at risk following \"years of funding cuts\" and that local authorities have now been forced to \"decommission vital services\".",
      "\"Rising costs alongside reduced funding have rendered many services unviable, forcing many to close, while demand for supported housing continues to rise. The decision to increase employers' National Insurance contributions has placed even further pressure on providers' budgets.\"",
      "The organisations are calling for long-term increased funding for housing-related support of at least \u00a31.6bn per year for councils and for supported homes to be among the 1.5 million new houses planned by the government.",
      "\"We recognise the vital role played by supported housing in helping vulnerable people to live independently and well, and the contribution it makes to tackling rough sleeping and timely hospital discharge,\" a spokesperson for the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said.",
      "The spokesperson said the government was putting \u00a32bn into increasing social and affordable housebuilding in 2026-27, with further details to be set out in a long-term housing strategy later this year.",
      "Proponents of austerity measures say tough funding choices need to be made to balance the UK's finances.",
      "However, Shaoxiong Liu says his family do not know what they would have done without a supported housing place for his son Jason.",
      "Aged 39, Jason has autism, a learning disability and mental health challenges. As he grew older, this became increasingly unmanageable for his family. After falling ill, Jason was admitted to hospital with sepsis in 2017.",
      "Due to his challenging behaviour and a condition that induces severe vomiting, he remained in hospital for months as they struggled to find somewhere long term that could accommodate his needs.",
      "He was eventually placed with Advance Housing, where his family says Jason has flourished in the intervening eight years. His weight has risen from 35kg to 53kg, he can go on bus trips and attends social events organised by the housing provider.",
      "\"Jason's behaviour is so much better now. He's lived there so long and he's happy there,\" Mr Liu says. \"Jason is an adult now and we are in our 70s, so his behaviour could be quite dangerous for us if he lived with us - we couldn't look after him.\"",
      "The NHF says one in three providers in England it surveyed say they may have to stop providing services altogether, meaning the loss of 70,000 supported homes across the country.",
      "In 2009, ringfenced council funding for housing-related support was removed. When council budgets were cut during austerity from 2010, funding was needed in other areas, meaning some councils had to cut supported housing services.",
      "The NHF says that means there are now fewer supported homes than in 2007, including a net loss of 3,000 supported homes in the last three years. It calculates there is a total shortfall of up to 325,000 supported homes, based on unmet need.",

    "story": [
      "Energy secretary Ed Miliband is \"considering\" plans to introduce regional pricing for power that could lead to lower bills in parts of the country that generate more energy.",
      "He did not set out details of the \"zonal pricing\" scheme, which is meant to make the national energy grid more efficient and encourage investment.",
      "But he rejected claims in a Daily Telegraph article that it would mean increased energy bills for southern English households.",
      "Some energy companies have backed the idea - but others say it will scare off investment and lead to higher bills.",
      "If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down?",
      "Could Scotland have Europe's lowest electricity bills?",
      "GB Energy to be blocked from using slavery-linked solar",
      "According to the Telegraph government officials have advised Miliband to back plans for a form of regional pricing used in some other parts of the world including Australia, Italy and Sweden.",
      "If implemented, it would be the biggest reform of the power market since the 1990s privatisation.",
      "Under the scheme, power costs would match local supply and demand. In practice it could lead to lower bills in areas with abundant wind generation like Scotland rather than households in the South.",
      "The scheme is supported by some energy businesses - including Greg Jackson, the boss of Octopus Energy, the UK's largest domestic energy supplier.",
      "Mr Jackson said it could make the overall system more efficient and reduce the amount of network upgrades needed to shift the electricity from where it's generated to where it's consumed.",
      "But Dale Vince, the founder of green energy company Ecotricity and a Labour donor, said on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that zonal pricing was a \"terrible idea\" as \"tens of millions of Britons could end up paying more for their energy than they do now\".",
      "Speaking ahead of an international energy security summit in London, Miliband said the government were considering options to change energy pricing but insisted \"absolutely no decision has been made\".",
      "\"This is an incredibly complex question that we are looking at about how we reform our energy market,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"There are two options, zonal pricing and reformed national pricing.",
      "\"Whatever route we go down my bottom line is bills have got to fall, and they should fall throughout the country.",
      "\"We are going to take our time over this very complex and important decision.\"",
      "Can I fix my energy prices?",
      "The Liberal Democrats warned against regional pricing saying the \"government has got to ensure that reforms to electricity pricing ultimately bring down customers' bills and create a fairer system - across the board.\"",
      "The party's energy and net zero spokesperson, Pippa Heylings, said: \"In a cost-of-living crisis and when energy giants have been raking it in - energy bills should be going down not up.\"",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the plans \"a form of bribery\", saying cheaper bills would be a payoff for massive infrastructure projects \"ruining\" the local area.",
      "\"None of this I think has been fully thought through,\" he argued.",
      "\"I think Ed Miliband has a religious fervour for achieving that zero, regardless of the consequences.\"",
      "The Green Party of England and Wales have also called on the government to reject regional pricing.",
      "Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay told the BBC: \"People live in poverty all over the country - penalising families struggling to pay their bills because of where they happen to live would be wrong.\"",
      "The Conservatives have also been approached for comment."

      "The idea has cross-party support, with some Labour and Tory MPs previously suggesting similar measures.",
      "However, without government support the Lib Dem proposals are unlikely to become law.",
      "Why do people play music in public through a phone?",
      "Loud music could be banned on buses in West Midlands",
      "A survey of more than 2,000 UK adults for the Lib Dems, conducted by Savanta, found 38% had experienced people playing music out loud often or sometimes.",
      "Some 54% of people would not feel comfortable asking someone to turn down their music on public transport, the findings suggest.",

      "It said this should be accompanied by a national publicity campaign, including posters on train platforms and at bus stops.",
      "Currently passengers who breach bylaws can be removed from trains or stations, with a maximum fine of \u00a31,000.",
      "Existing regulations also allow passengers to be removed from buses if they play sounds which are likely to annoy others.",
      "Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart said: \"Far too many people dread their daily commute because of the blight of anti-social behaviour - and headphone dodgers playing loud music on buses and trains are some of the worst offenders.",
      "\"Whether you're heading to work, taking your kids to school, or simply trying to enjoy a moment of peace, everyone deserves to feel safe and respected on public transport.\"",
      "She added: \"It's time to take a stand for the quiet majority who just want to get from A to B in peace.\"",
      "Conservative shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon said: \"Playing loud music on public transport may seem like a small thing, but it speaks towards a growing tolerance of anti-social behaviour that chips away at public civility.\"",
      "He added that the Conservative Party supports \"common-sense reforms like this\" but \"any new byelaws must be backed by stepping up enforcement - something the Liberal Democrats' plan fails to deliver\".",

    "title": "If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down?",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkep1vx3mro",
    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 09:15:15 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to reduce energy bills by using more renewables, but bills are currently rising.",
    "story": [
      "Energy bills rose by 6% for a typical family in April, following an announcement from the regulator Ofgem.",
      "But Labour pledged in its manifesto: \"We will save families hundreds of pounds on their bills, not just in the short term, but for good.\" It also promised bills would come down by \"up to \u00a3300 by 2030\".",
      "Responding to the 6% price cap rise, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said it was due to \"our reliance on the fossil fuel markets\" and added: \"We're acting to bring down bills for everyone with our mission for clean, home-grown power that we control.\"",
      "The government wants to remove nearly all fossil fuels from UK electricity production by 2030.",
      "More power is coming from renewable sources than ever before, so why isn't this translating into cheaper electricity bills?",
      "There are a number of reasons, including the time and money it takes to make the power system greener, the question of who pays, and the way the electricity market is set up.",
      "People should consider energy bill fix, regulator says",
      "Is Labour's 2030 green energy goal realistic and how would it affect bills?",
      "How do UK prices compare with other countries?",
      "The UK's electricity is expensive.",
      "Compared with countries in the European Union, UK domestic electricity prices ranked fourth highest in the first half of 2024 - the most recent government data.",
      "This is for consumers with medium usage, including taxes and subsidies.",
      "For industrial electricity, the UK had the highest prices - for medium users - over the same period.",
      "The UK has much higher electricity prices - both domestic and industrial - than other large economies outside Europe, such as the US and Canada.",
      "The largest, and most variable, component of a UK customer's electricity bill is the \"wholesale\" price. This is the cost at which suppliers buy it from the companies that generate it.",
      "Other parts of the bill include \"network\" costs for operating, maintaining and upgrading the power grid, and \"policy\" costs, which include government levies to help fund environmental projects.",
      "The main reason for the spikes in electricity bills over the past few years has been changes to wholesale costs. This is linked to an increase in international gas prices.",
      "How is the price set?",
      "The price for wholesale electricity is set by a bidding process, with each generating company saying what it would be willing to accept to produce a unit of electricity.",
      "Once built, the cost of generating power from renewables is very low, so these typically come in with the cheapest bid. Nuclear might come next.",
      "Gas generators often have the highest costs, because they have to buy gas to burn, as well as paying a \"carbon price\" - a charge for emissions.",
      "The wholesale cost is set by the last unit of electricity needed to meet demand from consumers. This means that even if gas only generates 1% of power at a given time, gas will still set the wholesale price.",
      "In Great Britain, this generally happens more often than its European counterparts, where demand can be met more often without relying on gas.",
      "\"The main reason why electricity prices are currently high is because the cost of gas - which is what sets the electricity price - is also high,\" said a spokesperson from the Climate Change Committee, the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions.",
      "How cheap is renewable energy?",
      "Renewables can generate electricity cheaply.",
      "But building a wind farm on land - and particularly out at sea - comes with high up-front costs and the planning process is often lengthy.",
      "The government needs to triple wind and solar capacity. To get developers to deliver this, it needs to provide certainty that they will get a return on their investment.",
      "It does that by agreeing a fixed price - or strike price - that they will be paid for each unit of electricity generated for 15 years into the future.",
      "If the wholesale price is below this fixed price, the renewable generator gets paid a top up by a government-owned company. If the wholesale price is above the strike price, the generator pays the difference back.",
      "Any costs or savings are then passed onto consumers via bills.",
      "Strike prices were expensive, but have fallen considerably, apart from a small rise from 2022-24 linked to global supply chain pressures.",
      "As more renewables are connected - and operational improvements mean the grid can be safely run on this type of power - there should be more times when gas is not setting the wholesale price.",
      "\"There are in practice very few hours at the moment in which gas does not set the price despite being a minority of the overall generation,\" said Adam Berman, director of policy at Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry.",
      "\"The more that you are able to have a renewable infrastructure that can deliver electricity at any hour of the day and in any circumstance, the more you are able to move away from gas setting the price.\"",
      "What about extra costs?",
      "The UK has an ageing electricity grid, which needs upgrading, partly to accommodate new renewable power sources. There are times when wind power is actually paid not to generate, because the grid cannot handle all the electricity that it could produce.",
      "This adds to the network costs in a bill.",
      "Intermittent renewable sources also require backup for when it's not windy or sunny. In the short term, this role will be largely filled by gas, but eventually it could be met by storing renewable energy in batteries or by hydrogen power.",
      "Great Britain's island location means it is more expensive than in continental Europe to build interconnectors - cables to connect electricity systems of neighbouring countries - to help meet periods of low output.",
      "Some analysts have also argued that placing extra social and environmental taxes on electricity bills - rather than gas bills or general taxation - makes electricity artificially expensive.",
      "What is being done?",
      "The government is reviewing the structure of the electricity market, alongside its push for clean power through renewables and nuclear.",
      "In the long term, renewables \"will be bringing down overall energy bills, and specifically electricity bills, for the UK,\" argues Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London.",
      "But savings in the short term are not guaranteed. A faster rollout of renewables could mean upfront costs - for things like upgrading the grid - being passed onto consumers more quickly.",
      "Some analysts have also expressed concern that a rush to secure enough renewables to meet the 2030 goal could mean less competitive \"strike prices\", locking in higher costs.",
      "\"If you think 10-15 years down the line, you are likely to see the cost for technologies like offshore wind decrease further\u2026 but potentially the rush to have to do this in the next couple of years means that you have to lock in a lot of these projects now to make sure that it can deliver [for 2030],\" said Pranav Menon, research associate at the Aurora Energy Research think tank.",
      "\"That does mean that you are going to push up against stretched supply chains, which could mean that cost to procure that [extra capacity] increases.\"",
      "But a rapid roll-out of renewables would also reduce the UK's dependence on gas - the main cause of the price spike of the past few years - and so there could be benefits sooner if gas prices remain high.",
      "The government said earlier in February that its plans would \"bring down bills for households and businesses for good\" and lowering them by \"up to \u00a3300 by 2030\" remains an objective.",

      "The UK is seeking to lower trade taxes imposed by President Donald Trump of 25% for cars, steel and aluminium and 10% on other British exports.",
      "One of the sticking points for a trade deal in the past has been food standards, but Reeves said the UK would not be reducing these.",
      "Earlier today a document circulated among US business groups and unions seeking views on a potential deal with the UK, focused on lowering UK tariffs on US cars to 2.5% from their current 10%.",
      "The chancellor suggested she was open to this to secure a wider trade deal.",
      "President Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US \u2013 including from the UK.",
      "The UK is also facing a broader tariff rate of 10%, and is looking to negotiate an agreement with the US administration, along with dozens of other countries hit with even higher levies \u2013 most of which are currently on pause until July.",
      "UK negotiators are working \"flat out\" to get an agreement that is in the country's national interest, Reeves told the BBC at an event in Washington.",
      "\"We are willing to reduce trade barriers in the UK, those trade barriers that do exist. And we want to build on the relationship that we have,\" she added later speaking at a Semafor event.",
      "Some US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.",
      "Speaking to the BBC at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) event on Wednesday, Reeves said the UK was \"not going to rush into a deal\".",
      "But she said the government was \"confident that working with our partners in the US we can get a better trading relationship and build on the substantial trade that already exists between our two great countries\".",
      "\"We want to get the right deal for Britain, to better support our industry, our jobs and consumers,\" she added.",
      "Reeves said that the UK had been \"really clear\" in discussions with US negotiators \"that we're not going to be reducing agricultural standards in the UK\".",
      "\"The US administration respect and understand that we have high standards to support British farming, and to support British consumers, and we're not going to be relaxing those standards,\" she said.",
      "Many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in the UK and the European Union in the 1980s.",
      "The US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones.",
      "Farmers in the UK warned ministers last week not to dilute British food standards, saying the use of hormones in rearing livestock cannot be accepted.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives would \"expect\" Reeves to stick to agricultural standards \"but let's see the detail as and when there is a deal\".",
      "He said it is \"hugely important\" to \"get these 25% tariffs on cars and steel down\" but he said the government should be moving faster on negotiations.",

      "The move has rattled the world economy, sparking turmoil on global financial markets.",

      "On Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the UK must take the risk of trade wars hitting global economic growth \"very seriously\".",
      "However, Reeves said: \"I do understand the concerns the US has about countries around the world that run large and persistent trade surpluses with the US.\"",

    "story": [
      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",

    "story": [
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has called for countries to cooperate to reduce the risk to global energy supplies.",
      "He was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security in London, which is being attended by delegates from more than 50 governments, including the US and the EU.",
      "Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being \"weaponised\", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.",
      "Delegates will be discussing how to reduce the mounting risks to energy arising from the wars in Europe and the Middle East, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, extreme weather, attacks on undersea cable and cyber warfare.",

      "He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.",
      "The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased \"international fragmentation\" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.",
      "\"Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.\"",
      "He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.",
      "Global gas prices spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 09:00:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.",
    "story": [
      "Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.",
      "Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.",
      "The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.",
      "The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.",
      "This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.",
      "The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.",
      "\"We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,\" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "\"These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.\"",
      "Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.",
      "By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.",
      "That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.",
      "The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.",
      "Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.",
      "\"Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'\"",
      "Clues for Antarctica?",
      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",
      "And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.",
      "The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.",
      "Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.",
      "\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.",

      "The recommendation is part of a submission made to the UK government's independent review into the water sector.",
      "Campaigners have long complained the companies' self-reporting has prevented the true scale of pollution in UK water being revealed.",

      "England water pollution at 10-year high, campaigners say",
      "Government has broken the law on sewage, says watchdog",
      "A report from the National Audit Office examining the three water regulators (Ofwat, the Environment Agency, and the Drinking Water Inspectorate) and Defra, is expected on Friday.",
      "David Henderson, CEO of industry body Water UK, told the BBC: \"We absolutely accept that self-monitoring is not helping to instil trust and so we would like to see an end to it, and in place of it a more robust, third-party system.\"",
      "As part of their permitting arrangements water companies are expected to regularly sample water quality to identify potential pollution, and submit this data to the Environment Agency in an arrangement known as \"operator self monitoring\".",
      "But there have been incidents of misreporting by water companies in England and Wales uncovered by the regulators, who said some cases had been deliberate.",
      "Southern Water was previously issued fines totalling \u00a3213m by the industry regulator (Ofwat) and the environmental regulator (the Environment Agency) for manipulating sewage data.",
      "In that case, there was unreported pollution into numerous conservation sites which caused \"major environmental harm\" to wildlife.",
      "The company later admitted its actions \"fell short\".",
      "Henderson added that the industry never asked to self-monitor, but that it was introduced in 2009 by the then Labour government to \"reduce the administrative burden\" on the Environment Agency (EA).",
      "In 2023, the BBC reported that EA staff were concerned that, due to funding cuts, the Agency was increasingly relying on water companies to self-report rather than carrying out its own checks on pollution from sewage.",
      "The current environment minister, Steve Reed, has promised to review the system, calling it the equivalent of companies \"mark[ing] their own homework\".",
      "But the National Audit Office (NAO), which reviews government spending, questioned the ability of regulators, like the EA, to take on any new monitoring.",
      "\"Regulators need to address the fact that they currently have limited oversight over whether water companies are carrying out their work as expected. It is hard to see how they will achieve this without increased overall capacity,\" said Anita Shah, NAO Director of Regulation.",
      "It is expected to publish a full review of the regulation of the water sector on Friday.",
      "A Defra spokesperson told the BBC: \"We are committed to taking decisive action to fix the water industry. The Water Commission's recommendations will mark the next major step [to] restore public trust in the sector.\"",
      "The government launched an independent water commission in October to review the sector and the way it is regulated. The public consultation closed on Wednesday with the findings expected in July.",
      "Water UK submitted a 200-page document of recommendations, including this call to end self-monitoring.",
      "The industry body also requested that water meters be universal across England and Wales to make bills fairer. At present about 60% of the population have a meter.",
      "\"The meter is just to ensure that people are paying for what they use as opposed to a flat rate of system where you can use virtually no water and pay the same as someone filling up a pool three times in a summer,\" said Henderson.",

    "story": [
      "Bite marks found on the skeleton of a Roman gladiator are the first archaeological evidence of combat between a human and a lion, experts say.",
      "The remains were discovered during a 2004 dig at Driffield Terrace, in York, a site now thought to be the world's only well-preserved Roman gladiator cemetery.",
      "Forensic examination of the skeleton of one young man has revealed that holes and bite marks on his pelvis were most likely caused by a lion.",
      "Prof Tim Thompson, the forensic expert who led the study, said this was the first \"physical evidence\" of gladiators fighting big cats.",
      "\"For years our understanding of Roman gladiatorial combat and animal spectacles has relied heavily on historical texts and artistic depictions,\" he said.",
      "\"This discovery provides the first direct, physical evidence that such events took place in this period, reshaping our perception of Roman entertainment culture in the region.\"",
      "Experts used new forensic techniques to analyse the wounds, including 3D scans which showed the animal had grabbed the man by the pelvis.",
      "Prof Thompson, from Maynooth University, in Ireland, said: \"We could tell that the bites happened at around the time of death.",
      "\"So this wasn't an animal scavenging after the individual died - it was associated with his death.\"",
      "As well as scanning the wound, scientists compared its size and shape to sample bites from large cats at London Zoo.",
      "\"The bite marks in this particular individual match those of a lion,\" Prof Thompson told BBC News.",
      "The location of the bites gave researchers even more information about the circumstances of the gladiator's death.",
      "The pelvis, Prof Thompson explained, \"is not where lions normally attack, so we think this gladiator was fighting in some sort of spectacle and was incapacitated, and that the lion bit him and dragged him away by his hip.\"",
      "The skeleton, a male aged between 26 and 35, had been buried in a grave with two others and overlaid with horse bones.",
      "Previous analysis of the bones pointed to him being a Bestiarius - a gladiator that was sent into combat with beasts.",
      "Malin Holst, a Senior Lecturer in Osteoarchaeology at the University of York, said in 30 years of analysing skeletons she had \"never seen anything like these bite marks\".",
      "Additionally, she said the man's remains revealed the story of a \"short and somewhat brutal life\".",
      "His bones were shaped by large, powerful muscles and there was evidence of injuries to his shoulder and spine, which were associated with hard physical work and combat.",
      "Ms Holst, who is also managing director of York Osteoarchaeology, added: \"This is a hugely exciting find because we can now start to build a better image of what these gladiators were like in life.\"",
      "The findings, which have been published in the Journal of Science and Medical Research PLoS One, also confirmed the \"presence of large cats and potentially other exotic animals in arenas in cities such as York, and how they too had to defend themselves from the threat of death\", she said.",
      "Experts said the discovery added weight to the suggestion an amphitheatre, although not yet found, likely existed in Roman York and would have staged fighting gladiators as a form of entertainment.",
      "The presence of distinguished Roman leaders in York would have meant they required a lavish lifestyle, experts said, so it was no surprise to see evidence of gladiatorial events, which served as a display of wealth.",
      "David Jennings, CEO of York Archaeology, said: \"We may never know what brought this man to the arena where we believe he may have been fighting for the entertainment of others, but it is remarkable that the first osteoarchaeological evidence for this kind of gladiatorial combat has been found so far from the Colosseum of Rome, which would have been the classical world's Wembley Stadium of combat.\""

      "ESA is funding the research to explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut, which can cost up to \u00a320,000 per day.",
      "The team involved say the experiment is a first step to developing a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station in two years' time.",
      "Lab-grown food will be essential if Nasa's objective of making humanity a multi-planetary species were to be realised, claims Dr Aqeel Shamsul, CEO and founder of Bedford-based Frontier Space, which is developing the concept with researchers at Imperial College, London.",

On Earth, there are claimed environmental benefits for the technology over traditional agricultural food production methods, such as less land use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

That will mean sending up food for tens and eventually hundreds of astronauts living and working in space \u2013 something that would be prohibitively expensive if it were sent up by rockets, according to Dr Shamsul.",
      "Growing food in space would make much more sense, he suggests.",
      "\"We could start off simply with protein-enhanced mashed potatoes on to more complex foods which we could put together in space,\" he tells me.",
      "\"But in the longer term we could put the lab-grown ingredients into a 3D printer and print off whatever you want on the space station, such as a steak!\"",
      "This sounds like the replicator machines on Star Trek, which are able to produce food and drink from pure energy. But it is no longer the stuff of science fiction, says Dr Shamsul.",
      "He showed me a set-up, called a bioreactor, at Imperial College's Bezos Centre for Sustainable Proteins in west London. It comprised a brick-coloured concoction bubbling away in a test tube. The process is known as precision fermentation, which is like the fermentation used to make beer, but different: \"precision\" is a rebranding word for genetically engineered.",
      "In this case a gene has been added to yeast to produce extra vitamins, but all sorts of ingredients can be produced in this way, according to Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, Director of the Bezos Centre.",
      "\"We can make all the elements to make food,\" says Dr Ledesma-Amaro proudly.",

There is plenty of evidence that foods can be successfully grown from cells on Earth, but can the process be repeated in the weightlessness and higher radiation of space?",
      "Drs Ledesma-Amaro and Shamsul have sent small amounts of the yeast concoction to orbit the Earth in a small cube satellite on board Europe's first commercial returnable spacecraft, Phoenix. If all goes to plan, it will orbit the Earth for around three hours before falling back to Earth off the coast of Portugal. The experiment will be retrieved by a recovery vessel and sent back to the lab in London to be examined.",
      "The data they gather will inform the construction of a larger, better bioreactor which the scientists will send into space next year, according to Dr Ledesma-Amaro.",
      "The problem, though, is that the brick-coloured goo, which is dried into a powder, looks distinctly unappetising \u2013 even less appetising than the freeze-dried fare that astronauts currently have to put up with.",

      "He isn't allowed to use lab grown ingredients to make dishes for people just yet, because regulatory approval is still pending. But he's getting a head start. For now, instead of lab-grown ingredients, Jakub is using starches and proteins from naturally occurring fungi to develop his recipes.

      "Research on the ISS has shown that the biochemistry of astronauts' bodies changes during long duration space missions: their hormone balance and iron levels alter, and they lose calcium from their bones. Astronauts take supplements to compensate, but lab-grown food could in principle be tweaked with the extra ingredients already built in, says Dr Sharman.",

      "As the threat posed by US President Donald Trump tops Canada's federal election agenda, the issue of the country's contribution to global warming has been largely overshadowed.",
      "The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US.",
      "Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.",
      "It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.",
      "In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.",
      "That sense of unity is now long gone.",
      "Carney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change.",
      "As well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26.",
      "However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.",
      "The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.",
      "It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as \"Carbon Tax Carney\".",

      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "Some observers believe that cancelling the tax was a smart political move, others feel it was a mistake.",
      "\"By making one of your first moves the removal of the carbon price, you're accepting this narrative that climate change policy costs us too much money and isn't good for us, when, in fact, that is not the case,\" said Catherine Abreu, who is director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a member of Canada's Net Zero Advisory Body.",
      "\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"",
      "Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\".",
      "He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.",
      "There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.",
      "Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.",
      "The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals.",
      "\"We have had a parade of geopolitical allies turning up on our doorstep saying, we want your rocks, we want Canada to be the geopolitically secure primary resource commodity provider, in place of Russia,\" said Mark Winfield, a professor in the faculty of environmental and urban change at Toronto's York University.",
      "\"And that's created another sort of dynamic in all of this, which was not present in previous elections.\"",
      "Pierre Poilievre is the man seeking to replace Carney as PM.",
      "He is running on cost of living issues, and advocating for tougher policies on law and order and what he considers \"woke\" cultural issues.",
      "Poilievre, whose party has a strong voter base in energy-rich regions of the country, is pushing for a major expansion of the oil and gas industries and the removal of the carbon tax on industry.",
      "While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace \"dirty coal\" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.",
      "According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.",
      "He told the BBC it's more \"at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable\".",
      "Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.",
      "That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.",
      "\"Our relationship with the US has completely changed,\" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates.",
      "\"The pipelines are a national security problem for us.\"",
      "That concern over US dependence has revived interest in pipelines that would move oil and gas from the western provinces, where they are mainly produced, to the east, where they could be exported to new overseas markets.",
      "A previous attempt called the Energy East pipeline was shelved in 2017 due to a number of factors, including fierce opposition from some regions of the country and regulatory hurdles.",
      "In this campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised to fast track \"energy corridors\",  though Carney has flip-flopped on his support for pipelines, knowing they are deeply unpopular with environmentalists.",
      "He is trying to walk a fine line between defending Canada as a nation under threat from Trump, and taking action on a warming climate.",
      "The Insurance Bureau of Canada reported that in 2024, there were C$8.5bn ($6.1bn;  \u00a34.6bn) in weather-related insured losses, triple the figure for 2023.",
      "And while the two election frontrunners are advocating a major role for fossil fuels in Canada's economy, this approach will clash head on with the country's climate commitments.",
      "Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a federal party based in Quebec, has accused the pair of being in a \"denial situation about climate change\".",
      "\"I'm sorry to crash your party guys, but you are telling fairy tales\" about clean oil and gas, he said in last week's debates.",

      "As of 2023, carbon output was only down 8.5%.",

    "summary": "Scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the island's next big one could be.",
    "story": [
      "Perched on top of Santorini's sheer cliffs is a world-famous tourist industry worth millions. Underneath is the fizzing risk of an almighty explosion.",
      "A huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim.",
      "Now scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be.",
      "BBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues.",
      "Just weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes.",
      "It was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.",
      "Prof Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored.",
      "\"It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,\" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.",
      "This work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent.",
      "Santorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a \"period of unrest\", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\".",
      "\"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says.",
      "\"We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,\" she says.",
      "The Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.",
      "Beneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds.",
      "\"We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,\" Isobel says.",
      "The robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock.",
      "Those vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes.",
      "They are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month.",
      "So far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.",
      "\"We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,\" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. \"We have to look inside the earth,\" she says.",
      "The Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island.",
      "The two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.",
      "The expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.",
      "She is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.",
      "\"This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,\" she says.",
      "It will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds.",
      "These missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts.",
      "John Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents.",
      "\"Don't pick that one up,\" he warns. \"It's full of arsenic.\"",
      "Pointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: \"This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.\"",
      "These rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. \"This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,\" he says.",
      "But the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall.",
      "Using a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found.",
      "They have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.",
      "They identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.",
      "This is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.",
      "\"We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,\" Paraskevi says.",
      "The recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism.",
      "Back on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter.",
      "\"It was really scary, as it got more and more intense,\" she says.",
      "She's back now but business is slower. \"People have cancelled bookings. Normally I start shoots in April but my first job isn't until May,\" Eva says.",
      "In the main square of Santorini's upmarket town Oia, British-Canadian tourist Janet tells us six of her group of 10 cancelled their holiday.",
      "She believes more accurate scientific information about the likelihood of earthquakes and volcanoes would help others feel more reassured about visiting.",
      "\"I get the Google alerts, I get the scientists' alerts, and it helps me feel safe,\" she said.",
      "But Santorini will always be a dream destination. In Imerovigli, we see two people climbing onto the curved rooftops to get the perfect shot.",
      "The couple - married for just 15 minutes - travelled from Latvia and were not put off by the island's underwater risks.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:06:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate activists may be going deeper underground.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods.

    "summary": "The UK Energy Secretary was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security.",
    "story": [
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has called for countries to cooperate to reduce the risk to global energy supplies.",
      "He was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security in London, which is being attended by delegates from more than 50 governments, including the US and the EU.",
      "Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being \"weaponised\", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.",
      "Delegates will be discussing how to reduce the mounting risks to energy arising from the wars in Europe and the Middle East, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, extreme weather, attacks on undersea cable and cyber warfare.",
      "In his opening remarks, Ed Miliband said he recognised the value of fossil fuels in the energy mix but made clear that, at least for the UK, the future of energy is low-carbon.",
      "He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.",
      "The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased \"international fragmentation\" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.",
      "\"Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.\"",
      "He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.",
      "Global gas prices spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threat as relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.",
      "The US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a \"success\" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.",
      "Many think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position.",
      "\"On the big calls \u2013 like the future of global oil demand \u2013 the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation",
      "\"As countries come together to shape a new energy security paradigm, they need unbiased, dependable data on the future direction of energy,\" he added.",
      "Miliband also read out a letter from King Charles III.",
      "\"As we all navigate the transition to cleaner energy for our planet and energy security for our citizens, summits such as these are of vital importance in facilitating shared learning between nations, particularly those in the global south and across the Commonwealth,\" King Charles wrote.",
      "The UK government wants 95% of Great Britain's electricity mix to come from clean energy by the end of the decade - currently this stands around 60%.",
      "Miliband told the BBC's R4 Today programme that this would guarantee lower energy bills by 2030.",

    "summary": "Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.",
    "story": [
      "Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.",
      "Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.",
      "The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.",
      "The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.",
      "This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.",
      "The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.",
      "\"We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,\" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "\"These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.\"",
      "Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.",
      "By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.",
      "That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.",
      "The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.",
      "Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.",
      "\"Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'\"",
      "Clues for Antarctica?",
      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",
      "And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.",
      "The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.",
      "Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.",
      "\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.",

      "As the threat posed by US President Donald Trump tops Canada's federal election agenda, the issue of the country's contribution to global warming has been largely overshadowed.",
      "The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US.",
      "Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.",
      "It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.",
      "In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.",
      "That sense of unity is now long gone.",
      "Carney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change.",
      "As well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26.",
      "However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.",
      "The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.",
      "It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as \"Carbon Tax Carney\".",

      "\"By making one of your first moves the removal of the carbon price, you're accepting this narrative that climate change policy costs us too much money and isn't good for us, when, in fact, that is not the case,\" said Catherine Abreu, who is director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a member of Canada's Net Zero Advisory Body.",
      "\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"",
      "Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\".",
      "He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.",
      "There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.",
      "Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.",
      "The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals.",
      "\"We have had a parade of geopolitical allies turning up on our doorstep saying, we want your rocks, we want Canada to be the geopolitically secure primary resource commodity provider, in place of Russia,\" said Mark Winfield, a professor in the faculty of environmental and urban change at Toronto's York University.",
      "\"And that's created another sort of dynamic in all of this, which was not present in previous elections.\"",
      "Pierre Poilievre is the man seeking to replace Carney as PM.",
      "He is running on cost of living issues, and advocating for tougher policies on law and order and what he considers \"woke\" cultural issues.",
      "Poilievre, whose party has a strong voter base in energy-rich regions of the country, is pushing for a major expansion of the oil and gas industries and the removal of the carbon tax on industry.",
      "While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace \"dirty coal\" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.",
      "According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.",
      "He told the BBC it's more \"at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable\".",
      "Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.",
      "That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.",
      "\"Our relationship with the US has completely changed,\" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates.",
      "\"The pipelines are a national security problem for us.\"",
      "That concern over US dependence has revived interest in pipelines that would move oil and gas from the western provinces, where they are mainly produced, to the east, where they could be exported to new overseas markets.",
      "A previous attempt called the Energy East pipeline was shelved in 2017 due to a number of factors, including fierce opposition from some regions of the country and regulatory hurdles.",
      "In this campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised to fast track \"energy corridors\",  though Carney has flip-flopped on his support for pipelines, knowing they are deeply unpopular with environmentalists.",
      "He is trying to walk a fine line between defending Canada as a nation under threat from Trump, and taking action on a warming climate.",
      "The Insurance Bureau of Canada reported that in 2024, there were C$8.5bn ($6.1bn;  \u00a34.6bn) in weather-related insured losses, triple the figure for 2023.",
      "And while the two election frontrunners are advocating a major role for fossil fuels in Canada's economy, this approach will clash head on with the country's climate commitments.",

      "\"I'm sorry to crash your party guys, but you are telling fairy tales\" about clean oil and gas, he said in last week's debates.",
      "Canada has promised on the international stage to curb carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 based on the levels in 2005.",
      "As of 2023, carbon output was only down 8.5%.",

      "A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying.",
      "The discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century, was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts.",
      "Now researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury.",
      "Another unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all  the other people who were buried with great care.",
      "\"Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,\" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project.",
      "About half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated.",
      "So far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female.",
      "\"I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery.\"",
      "The skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features.",
      "\"The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,\" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University.",
      "\"It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery.\"",
      "Artefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were.",
      "Shards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead.",
      "\"Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels.\"",
      "The presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west.",
      "The team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal.",
      "They have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her.",
      "Osteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s.",

      "Meanwhile, Meta's fine was over the choices it offered on data collection.",

      "At the end of March, all 25 bakeries supported by the WFP in Gaza were forced to close after wheat flour and cooking fuel ran out. Food parcels distributed to families containing two weeks' rations were also exhausted.",
      "Malnutrition is also rapidly worsening, according to the UN. Last week, one of its humanitarian partners screened 1,300 children in northern Gaza and identified more than 80 cases of acute malnutrition - a two-fold increase from previous weeks.",
      "The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says there are also severe shortages of medicine, medical supplies and equipment for hospitals overwhelmed by casualties from the Israeli bombardment, and that fuel shortages are hampering water production and distribution.",
      "World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said \"an awful and grim moment\" had been reached in Gaza.",

      "Food prices had skyrocketed by up to 1,400% compared to during the ceasefire, and the shortages of essential commodities raised serious nutrition concerns for vulnerable populations, including children under five, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and the elderly, it warned.",
      "\"The situation inside the Gaza Strip has once again reached a breaking point: people are running out of ways to cope, and the fragile gains made during the short ceasefire have unravelled. Without urgent action to open borders for aid and trade to enter, WFP's critical assistance may be forced to end,\" the agency said.",
      "\"WFP urges all parties to prioritize the needs of civilians and allow aid to enter Gaza immediately and uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law.\"",
      "More than 116,000 tonnes of food assistance - enough to feed one million people for up to four months - is positioned at aid corridors and is ready to be delivered as soon as Israel reopens Gaza's border crossings, according to the agency.",
      "In the meantime, WFP Country Director Antoine Renard told the BBC the agency was trying everything it could to keep the hot meals kitchens running.",
      "\"More than 80% of the population... have been displaced during the war. And just since 18 March [when the Israeli offensive restarted], you've got more than 400,000 people who have been displaced once again,\" he said.",
      "\"Every time you move, every time you lose assets. So these kitchens are so essential for people to have a basic meal.\"",
      "However, even when fully supplied, the kitchens have been reaching just half the population with only 25% of daily food needs.",
      "Gavin Kelleher, humanitarian access manager with the Norwegian Refugee Council, told the BBC from central Gaza that once the kitchens' food stocks ran out they would no longer able to provide anything.",
      "To survive, he said, people were eating less, bartering to \"exchange a bag of diapers for lentils or cooking oil\", or selling what belongings they have left to try to get cash to access remaining food supplies.",
      "He added that begging was also taking place on a scale not seen before in Gaza, but that people were not able to give to others anymore.",
      "\"The desperation is really, really severe.\"",
      "Earlier this week, the Israeli foreign ministry rejected criticism of the blockade from the UK, France and Germany, which called it \"intolerable\" and demanded it end immediately in a joint statement.",
      "The ministry said more than 25,000 lorries carrying almost 450,000 tonnes of aid had entered Gaza during the ceasefire, adding: \"Israel is monitoring the situation on the ground, and there is no shortage of aid in Gaza.\"",
      "It also said Israel was not obliged to allow in aid because Hamas had \"hijacked\" supplies \"to rebuild its terror machine\".",
      "Hamas has previously denied stealing aid and the UN has said it has kept \"a very good chain of custody on all the aid it's delivered\".",
      "Last week, Hamas rejected an Israeli proposal for a new ceasefire, which included a demand to disarm in return for a six-week pause in hostilities and the release of 10 of the 59 hostages still in captivity. The group reiterated it would hand over all of the hostages in exchange for an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal.",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",

    "story": [
      "Luigi Mangione has pleaded not guilty to all federal charges brought over the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York last year.",
      "The 26 year old, who was arrested in December and accused of shooting Mr Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel, faces the charges of murder and stalking.",
      "His not guilty plea means he will now face trial and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty if he is convicted.",
      "Mr Mangione arrived at the Lower Manhattan court on Friday wearing a prison outfit and with his hands in cuffs. He acknowledged he had read the indictment against him before entering his plea, telling the judge: \"not guilty\".",
      "Earlier on Friday, federal prosecutors officially filed to seek the death penalty in this case.",
      "They argued that he carried out Mr Thompson's murder \"to amplify an ideological message\" and spark resistance to the health insurance industry.",
      "US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who directed prosecutors to seek capital punishment, said in April that Mr Thompson's death was \"an act of political violence\".",
      "Mr Mangione's lawyers previously called discussion of executing him \"barbaric\".",
      "During the 35-minute hearing on Friday, Judge Margaret Garnett attempted to co-ordinate a pre-trial schedule, while Mr Mangione's lawyers continued to raise objections to his indictments on both federal and state charges in New York.",
      "The judge agreed Mr Mangione's lawyers would need months to go through prosecutors' \"three terabytes\" of evidence, including police footage, data from social media, financial and phone companies and other evidence from state prosecutors.",
      "It means Mr Mangione's federal trial will not take place before 2026 - with the judge planning his next federal appearance for 5 December, when a \"firm trial date\" will be set.",
      "During the hearing, Mr Mangione's lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, pushed for her client to be tried in federal court - where the death penalty is at stake - before state court, arguing the reverse would raise \"constitutional issues\".",
      "She also accused state prosecutors of \"eavesdropping\" on Mr Mangione's recorded calls with her from jail. Judge Garnett asked prosecutors to write a letter within seven days explaining how Mr Mangione would be ensured access to a separate phone line to make privileged calls with his legal team.",
      "The judge also asked Ms Friedman Agnifilo to submit a new motion by 27 June requesting the government be prevented from seeking the death penalty, since she submitted her first motion before prosecutors formally filed notice that they would do so.",
      "Judge Garnett also asked prosecutors to remind Bondi and government officials of rules surrounding public statements and their impact on a fair trial and jury selection.",
      "Mr Mangione is also facing state charges in both Pennsylvania, where he was arrested, and New York. At an arraignment in December, he pleaded not guilty to state murder and terrorism charges in New York.",
      "Mr Thompson was shot dead in Manhattan early on 4 December last year.",
      "The suspect escaped the scene before exiting the city. Five days later, Mr Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's restaurant in Pennsylvania.",
      "Public reaction to Mr Thompson's killing has shed light on deep frustrations with privatised healthcare. Some have celebrated Mr Mangione has a folk hero, and a fund set up for his legal defence garnered nearly $1m (\u00a3750,000) in donations.",
      "Supporters gathered outside the courthouse on Friday too.",
      "Shell casings with the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were found at the crime scene. Critics say these words are associated with healthcare companies avoiding payouts and increasing their profits."

    "story": [
      "Federal agents arrested a Wisconsin judge and charged her with obstruction for allegedly trying to help an undocumented immigrant evade arrest.",
      "Announcing her arrest, FBI director Kash Patel accused Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan of \"intentionally misdirecting\" immigration agents away from a Mexican man they were trying to arrest last week.",
      "\"Thankfully our agents chased down the perp on foot and he's been in custody since, but the Judge's obstruction created increased danger to the public,\" Patel wrote on X.",
      "During a preliminary court hearing on Friday, Dugan's lawyer said she \"wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety\".",
      "The judge has been charged with obstruction and concealing an individual to avoid arrest, and faces a maximum of six years in prison if convicted on both charges.",
      "Dugan was released on her own recognisance pending a hearing on 15 May.",
      "The charges stem from events that played out in Dugan's courtroom last week.",
      "On 17 April, an immigration judge issued a warrant for the arrest of Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican national facing three misdemeanour battery counts stemming from a domestic fight, according to court documents filed in the case by the FBI.",
      "The following day, Flores-Ruiz appeared in the Milwaukee court for a scheduled hearing, and six officers from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Agency arrived at the courthouse to make the arrest.",
      "The agents identified themselves to court officials and waited outside Dugan's courtroom, but according to the FBI affidavit, the judge became \"visibly angry, commented that the situation was 'absurd,' left the bench, and entered chambers\" when she learned of their presence.",
      "In the hallway outside the court, Dugan and the unnamed agents then argued over the type of arrest warrant that had been issued, before the judge instructed them to report to the office of the county's chief judge.",
      "While several agents were in the office, affidavit says, the judge ushered Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer to a side door meant for jury members leading out of the courtroom.",
      "But two agents remained near the courtroom and spotted Flores-Ruiz attempting to escape, the affidavit says.",
      "Flores-Ruiz, who authorities say had previously been deported from the US in 2013, managed to exit the courthouse but was arrested just minutes later after a short foot chase.",
      "Dugan's arrest came one day after a former judge in New Mexico was taken into custody accused of harbouring an alleged Venezuelan gang member in his home.",
      "\"I think some of these judges think they are beyond and above the law and they are not,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News in an interview on Friday.",
      "\"And if you are destroying evidence, if you are obstructing justice, when you have victims sitting in a courtroom of domestic violence, and you're escorting a criminal defendant out a back door, it will not be tolerated.\"",
      "Reaction to the arrest largely split along partisan lines.",
      "Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, called it a \"gravely serious and drastic move\".",
      "\"Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by,\" Baldwin said in a statement. \"By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line.\"",
      "Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson also criticised the arrest, calling it \"showboating\" and warned that it would have a \"chilling effect\" on court proceedings.",
      "Wisconsin's Republican US Senator, Ron Johnson, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: \"I would advise everyone to cooperate with federal law enforcement and not endanger them and the public by obstructing their efforts to arrest criminals and illegal aliens.\"",
      "Dugan was first elected as a judge in 2016, and was re-elected to a second six-year term in 2022.",
      "Judicial elections in Wisconsin are non-partisan, however Dugan was endorsed by Milwaukee's Democratic mayor.",
      "The obstruction charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, while the concealment charges can be punished by up to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine.",
      "In 2019, during the first Trump administration, a judge in Massachusetts was arrested after she allowed an undocumented immigrant defendant to retrieve property from a lockup in the courtroom. The immigrant then left the courtroom.",
      "Judge Shelley M Richmond Joseph was charged with obstruction, but the charges were dropped in 2022, although she still faces an ongoing ethics complaint stemming from the incident."

      "You might imagine that means the leaders of the United States and Ukraine would sit near one another. But French was historically the language of diplomacy so the President of les \u00c9tats-Unis may well be some distance from his Ukrainian counterpart.",
      "Given the tensions between the two leaders, some diplomats said this might be no bad thing and could avoid the risk of a confrontation like that in the Oval Office in February.",
      "It is possible both men could meet privately elsewhere in Rome, as some European countries were hoping, but it was not clear if that was likely. \"If it happens, it will be impromptu,\" one diplomat said.",
      "On Tuesday, Zelensky said he was ready in principle to see Trump in Rome. \"We are always ready to meet with our partners from the United State of America,\" he said.",
      "The following day, Trump said he had \"a lot of meetings set up\" but did not say with whom. On Friday, Zelensky cast doubt on whether he would manage to attend after all, following the latest Russian strikes on Kyiv disrupting his travel plans.",
      "The diplomatic focus will be on the part of St Peter's Square where presidents and prime ministers, princes and monarchs will sit waiting for the obsequies to begin. That will be the main opportunity for them to mingle and discuss the issues of the day, to make contacts and establish relationships.",
      "The journey to Rome could also provide an opportunity for diplomatic encounters. The Vatican said 170 delegations were coming including about 50 heads of state, 15 heads of government and 12 reigning monarchs. The chances of them meeting at one of Rome's two airports on arrival or departure is high.",
      "But while funerals can present diplomatic opportunities, they can also pose threats. There is the possibility of leaders coming into contact with an adversary. That is because politicians who are subject to European travel sanctions can visit Vatican City because it is considered neutral territory. Crucially, neither President Vladimir Putin of Russia, nor President Xi Jinping of China are due to attend.",

      "The most unpredictable moment could come in the service itself. Francis Campbell, the British ambassador to the Holy See from 2005 to 2011, said the funeral Mass involves a moment when celebrants give each other a sign of peace and leaders could find themselves shaking hands with people they would rather not. \"You cannot avoid it,\" he said. \"You are attending a religious ceremony and it's incumbent on you to participate as much as possible.\"",
      "At the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005, the then Prince of Wales found himself unexpectedly shaking hands with President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. The future King's spokesman said he had been \"caught by surprise\".",
      "There are also risks for leaders appearing before many thousands of mourners. At the same funeral in 2005, George Bush was booed by the crowd when his face was displayed on a monitor, an apparent judgement on the US president's war in Iraq.",
      "The former Prime Minister Harold Wilson is credited with coining the phrase \"a good working funeral\" in relation to the service marking the death of Winston Churchill in 1965.",

      "In recent years, there have been several such funerals following the deaths of the late Queen, the former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, and Ebrahim Raisi, the Iranian president.",
      "But \"working funerals\" have also been the subject of satire. Jim Hacker, the eponymous PM in the Yes, Prime Minister comedy on the BBC, said working funerals were a \"heaven sent\" opportunity.",
      "\"Dignified grief goes down very well with the voters, especially when it is shared by the world's statesmen,\" he told his aides. Working funerals were \"much better than a summit because there are no expectations. People don't expect their leaders to come back from a funeral with test ban agreements or farm quote reductions. So we can actually have some meaningful discussions. A summit is just a public relations circus.\""

    "summary": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has sent condolences four days after the Pope's death.",
    "story": [
      "The office of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has offered its condolences for Pope Francis, four days after his death.",
      "An earlier offer of condolences posted on social media by the official state account of Israel had previously been deleted, causing considerable controversy within the country.",
      "Israel is also sending a relatively low-level delegation to the late pontiff's funeral on Saturday, with only the country's Vatican ambassador in attendance.",
      "All of this has been seen in Israel and elsewhere as a sign of the Israeli government's displeasure with Pope Francis's impassioned remarks on the war in Gaza.",
      "Who is going to the Pope's funeral?",
      "We're orphans now, say Gaza Catholics the Pope called daily",
      "Belatedly and somewhat impersonally, the Israeli prime minister's office issued a two sentence offer of condolences on Thursday night.",
      "It read: \"The State of Israel expresses its deepest condolences to the Catholic Church and the Catholic community worldwide at the passing of Pope Francis. May he rest in peace.\"",
      "The tone of the original message tweeted by the verified @Israel account on X on the day of the Pope's death was noticeably warmer.",
      "It featured a photo of Pope Francis at the Western Wall in Jerusalem and concluded: \"May his memory be a blessing.\"",
      "But it was swiftly withdrawn, without explanation.",
      "Several Israeli media outlets reported on it being deleted, with the Jerusalem Post quoting officials at the foreign ministry saying that it had been posted in \"error\".",
      "The Jerusalem Post also quoted Israel's former ambassador to the Vatican, Raphael Schutz, describing the decision to delete the published statement as a mistake.",
      "In the face of such criticism, Israeli officials did point out that the country's current ambassador to the Vatican had offered his condolences in person.",
      "And it is the ambassador, Yaron Sideman, who will represent Israel at the funeral of Pope Francis.",
      "This is in marked contrast to the heads of state or government who will be attending from most major nations, including US President Donald Trump.",
      "It is also very different from the funeral of the last pope to die while still in office - that of John Paul II in 2005. Israel sent the then-president, Moshe Katsav, and the then-foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, to attend the ceremony.",
      "The current Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, did publish an eloquent and heartfelt tribute to Pope Francis in the hours after his death, describing him as a man of deep faith and boundless compassion.",
      "But there appear to be no plans for him to attend the funeral. No reason has been given, although it may have something to do with the funeral taking place on Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath.",
      "But it seems clear that the Israeli government's resentment of Pope Francis's expressions of solidarity with the Palestinians, especially during the war in Gaza, has soured its response to his death.",
      "Last November, Pope Francis suggested that the international community should examine whether Israel's military offensive in Gaza should be classed as genocide \u2013 an allegation Israel has vehemently denied.",
      "Earlier this year, he called the humanitarian situation in Gaza \"shameful\".",
      "In his very last public address on Easter Sunday - the day before his death - there was mention of Gaza once again. His address spoke of the suffering of both the Palestinians and the Israelis.",
      "Since his death, more details have emerged of how Pope Francis would be in contact almost daily with the small Christian community sheltering in a church in Gaza City during the war.",
      "Palestinians have spoken warmly of how much his expressions of empathy had given them hope.",
      "As a sign of how highly they respected the Pope, the Palestinian Authority is sending Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa to the funeral.",
      "All this has meant that some in Israel, especially among the coalition of religious and nationalist parties that buoy up Netanyahu's coalition, believe that Pope Francis had taken the side of the Palestinians, despite his expressions of sympathy for Israelis and his efforts at bolstering multi-faith dialogue.",
      "That sense of a rift between the current Israeli government and the Vatican may well be visible at the Pope's funeral in Rome, where Israel's leaders will be noticeable by their absence."

      "\"My bananas were seized and destroyed. Right now, our business has brought losses, and we only have a little money left,\" said Jestina Chanya, a trader in Karongo, about 50km (30 miles) from the border with Tanzania.",
      "Diplomatic efforts to address the dispute have failed but Tanzania's agriculture minister said fresh talks were ongoing.",

      "They said Tanzanian produce, especially potatoes, were larger and of better quality.",
      "Others said their customers preferred Tanzanian plantains over Malawian ones, describing the former as tastier, while the latter were often spongy.",
      "But since Thursday, Malawian authorities, both at the border and in nearby markets, have become increasingly strict \u2013 often arresting traders found with Tanzanian produce.",
      "\"When we bring goods from Tanzania, they turn us back. One of us was stopped and arrested right at the border,\" another trader said.",
      "Some of them said they had no idea why they were being blocked while some rich business people were still allowed to transport goods across the border.",
      "\"They are targeting us who have little capital, while those with big money are still bringing in goods,\" said Ms Chanya, who sells potatoes and bananas in Karonga market.",
      "Following the crackdown, some traders have resorted to selling their goods in secret, afraid to display them openly for fear of arrest.",
      "\"We only carry three or four bunches [of bananas], just to earn a living for the children,\" said Evelina Mwakijungu, adding: \"But our large consignments have been blocked, so we have no business - we're struggling with our families\".",
      "The normally bustling border crossing of Kasumulu remained noticeably quieter than usual with  drivers seen relaxing in the shade of trees, while others played draughts or lounged in the back of their lorries.",
      "They declined to be quoted directly but explained that they were simply waiting for word from their bosses on what to do next.",
      "On a normal day, more than 15 lorries loaded with agricultural produce would cross the border, drivers told the BBC.",
      "Malawi's trade ministry spokesperson Patrick Botha told local media that they were yet to get official communication on the issue.",
      "\"We are hearing [about] this from social media. At an appropriate time, we will comment,\" he was quoted as saying.",

      "But landlocked Malawi, which has relied on Tanzanian ports to carry its exports such as tobacco, sugar and soybeans to the rest of the world, will have to reroute its goods.",
      "It is not yet clear how hard South Africa, which exports various fruits, including apples and grapes, to Tanzania, will be hit by the ban. South African authorities are yet to comment.",

      "The move to allow exploration outside its national waters has been met by condemnation from China which said it \"violates\" international law.",
      "Thursday's order is the latest issued by the US president to try to increase America's access to minerals used by the aerospace, green technology and healthcare sectors.",

      "Deep-sea mining tech advances but doubts remain",
      "The latest US executive order was issued to \"establish the United States as a global leader in responsible seabed mineral exploration\", it reads.",
      "The move appears to bypass a long-running round of UN negotiations on mining in international waters.",
      "Many countries, including China, have delayed issuing permits until countries agreed a framework for how resources could be shared.",

      "China dominates global production of rare earths and critical metals like cobalt and lithium.",
      "Trump has been frustrated by this relative weakness of the US position, analysts say.",
      "\"We want the US to get ahead of China in this resource space under the ocean, on the ocean bottom,\" a US official said on Thursday.",
      "To achieve this, the order says the US will speed up the process of issuing exploration licences and recovery permits both in its own waters and in \"areas beyond national jurisdiction\".",
      "The administration estimates that deep-sea mining could boost the country's GDP by $300bn (\u00a3225bn) over 10 years and create 100,000 jobs",
      "The EU, the UK and others support a moratorium on the practice until further scientific research is carried out.",
      "Environmentalists and scientists are concerned that marine species living in the deep sea could be harmed by the process.",
      "\"Deep-sea mining is a deeply dangerous endeavour for our ocean,\" said Jeff Watters of Ocean Conservancy, a US-based environmental group.",

      "It is not clear how quickly deep-sea mining could begin but one mining company, The Metals Company (TMC), is already in discussions with the US government to obtain permits.",
      "TMC's CEO Gerard Barron has previously said he hopes to begin mining by the end of the year.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 07:18:43 GMT",
    "summary": "After a deadly militant attack in Kashmir, India suspended a key water treaty with neighbouring Pakistan.",
    "story": [
      "Will India be able to stop the Indus river and two of its tributaries from flowing into Pakistan?",
      "That's the question on many minds, after India suspended a major treaty governing water sharing of six rivers in the Indus basin between the two countries, following Tuesday's horrific attack in Indian-administered Kashmir.",
      "The 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) survived two wars between the nuclear rivals and was seen as an example of trans-boundary water management.",
      "The suspension is among several steps India has taken against Pakistan, accusing it of backing cross-border terrorism -  a charge Islamabad flatly denies. It has also hit back with reciprocal measures against Delhi, and said stopping water flow \"will be considered as an Act of War\".",
      "The treaty allocated the three eastern rivers \u2013 the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej \u2013 of the Indus basin to India, while 80% of the three western ones \u2013 the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab \u2013 to Pakistan.",
      "Disputes have flared in the past, with Pakistan objecting to some of India's hydropower and water infrastructure projects, arguing they would reduce river flows and violate the treaty. (More than 80% of Pakistan's agriculture and around a third of its hydropower depend on the Indus basin's water.)",
      "India, meanwhile, has been pushing to review and modify the treaty, citing changing needs - from irrigation and drinking water to hydropower - in light of factors like climate change.",
      "Over the years, Pakistan and India have pursued competing legal avenues under the treaty brokered by the World Bank.",
      "But this is the first time either side has announced a suspension - and notably, it's the upstream country, India, giving it a geographic advantage.",
      "But what does the suspension really mean? Could India hold back or divert the Indus basin's waters, depriving Pakistan of its lifeline? And is it even capable of doing so?",
      "Experts say it's nearly impossible for India to hold back tens of billions of cubic metres of water from the western rivers during high-flow periods. It lacks both the massive storage infrastructure and the extensive canals needed to divert such volumes.",
      "\"The infrastructure India has are mostly run-of-the-river hydropower plants that do not need massive storage,\" said Himanshu Thakkar, a regional water resources expert with the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People.",
      "Such hydropower plants use the force of running water to spin turbines and generate electricity, without holding back large volumes of water.",
      "Indian experts say inadequate infrastructure has kept India from fully utilising even its 20% share of the Jhelum, Chenab and Indus waters under the treaty - a key reason they argue for building storage structures, which Pakistan opposes citing treaty provisions.",
      "Experts say India can now modify existing infrastructure or build new ones to hold back or divert more water without informing Pakistan.",
      "\"Unlike in the past, India will now not be required to share its project documents with Pakistan,\" said Mr Thakkar.",
      "But challenges like difficult terrain and protests within India itself over some of its projects have meant that construction of water infrastructure in the Indus basin has not moved fast enough.",
      "After a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in 2016, Indian water resources ministry officials had told the BBC they would speed up construction of several dams and water storage projects in the Indus basin.",
      "Although there is no official information on the status of such projects, sources say progress has been limited.",
      "Some experts say that if India begins controlling the flow with its existing and potential infrastructure, Pakistan could feel the impact during the dry season, when water availability is already at its lowest.",
      "\"A more pressing concern is what happens in the dry season - when the flows across the basin are lower, storage matters more, and timing becomes more critical,\" Hassan F Khan, assistant professor of Urban Environmental Policy and Environmental Studies at Tufts University, wrote in the Dawn newspaper.",
      "\"That is where the absence of treaty constraints could start to be felt more acutely.\"",
      "The treaty requires India to share hydrological data with Pakistan - crucial for flood forecasting and planning for irrigation, hydropower and drinking water.",
      "Pradeep Kumar Saxena, India's former IWT commissioner for over six years, told the Press Trust of India news agency that the country can now stop sharing flood data with Pakistan.",
      "The region sees damaging floods during the monsoon season, which begins in June and lasts until September. But Pakistani authorities have said India was already sharing very limited hydrological data.",
      "\"India was sharing only around 40% of the data even before it made the latest announcement,\" Shiraz Memon, Pakistan's former additional commissioner of the Indus Waters Treaty, told BBC Urdu.",
      "Another issue that comes up each time there is water-related tension in the region is if the upstream country can \"weaponise\" water against the downstream country.",
      "This is often called a \"water bomb\", where the upstream country can temporarily hold back water and then release it suddenly, without warning, causing massive damage downstream.",
      "Could India do that?",
      "Experts say India would first risk flooding its own territory as its dams are far from the Pakistan border. However, it could now flush silt from its reservoirs without prior warning - potentially causing damage downstream in Pakistan.",
      "How water shortages are brewing wars",
      "How water shortages are brewing wars",
      "Himalayan rivers like the Indus carry high silt levels, which quickly accumulate in dams and barrages. Sudden flushing of this silt can cause significant downstream damage.",
      "There's a bigger picture: India is downstream of China in the Brahmaputra basin, and the Indus originates in Tibet.",
      "In 2016, after India warned that \"blood and water cannot flow together\" following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir which India blamed on Pakistan, China blocked a tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo - that becomes the Brahmaputra in northeast India.",
      "China, that has Pakistan as its ally, said they had done it as it was needed for a hydropower project they were building near the border. But the timing of the move was seen as Beijing coming in to help Islamabad.",
      "After building several hydropower plants in Tibet, China has green-lit what will be the world's largest dam on the lower reaches of Yarlung Tsangpo.",
      "Beijing claims minimal environmental impact, but India fears it could give China significant control over the river's flow."

      "Archbishops and bishops will start gathering at 08:30 local time (07:30 BST) in the Constantine Wing, a corridor adjacent to St Peter's Basilica.",
      "At the same time, Catholic priests will congregate in St Peter's Square.",
      "Half an hour later, at 09:00 local time, patriarchs from the Orthodox church and cardinals will congregate in Saint Sebastian Chapel, inside the basilica, where the remains of Pope John Paul II lie.",
      "They will walk in a funeral procession accompanying the Pope's coffin, which has spent the last four days in the centre of St Peter's Basilica.",
      "The funeral starts at 10:00 when the coffin is laid in the square in front of St Peter's Basilica. The service will be led by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.",
      "You can follow the order of service in full here.",
      "\u200b\u200bGuests and dignitaries will be seated closer to the basilica and coffin, with thousands of other clergy and members of the public in and around St Peter's Square, similar to the funeral for Pope Benedict XVI shown below.",
      "The service will end with prayers for Pope Francis and a final commendation - a concluding prayer where the Pope will be formally entrusted to God.",
      "This marks the beginning of a nine-day mourning period called Novemdiales with a mass held every day in his memory.",
      "Who will be attending?",
      "Officials expect at least 250,000 members of the public to attend the funeral and there are some 170 heads of state or government on the guestlist.",
      "Prince William will represent King Charles III, continuing a precedent set in 2005 when the then-Prince of Wales attended Pope John Paul II's funeral on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II.",
      "Other heads of state and royals include have confirmed their attendance, including US President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, and Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "How can you tell a bishop from a cardinal?",
      "There will also be hundreds of members of the clergy, with each group having a specific dress code for the service.",
      "For bishops and archbishops, the liturgical clothes for a funeral include the alb, a white tunic held by a traditional cord called cincture, the amice, a short linen cloth to cover the neck, and a red chasuble, a solemn cape, in honour of the pope. Finally, they don a simple white linen or silk mitre on their heads.",
      "Cardinals wear similar clothes, but they can be distinguished by their more ornate damask pattern mitres, which look cream rather than white.",
      "Priests wear simpler garments and a long scarf over their tunic called a red stole.",
      "The leaders, or patriarchs, of Orthodox churches will wear their own style of mitres, a cape called sakkos and an ornate cloth called omophorion, in colours according to their specific traditions.",

      "He will become the first Pope since Leo XIII, who died in 1903, to be buried outside the Vatican.",
      "How has Francis changed traditions?",
      "Traditionally, the Pope's remains would have been enclosed the day before the funeral in three nested coffins, made of cypress, lead, and oak.",
      "The cypress coffin symbolised humility and mortality; the outer oak coffin, a sign of 'dignity and strength' and the lead coffin, welded to preserve the remains and prevent tampering.",
      "Last year, however, Pope Francis requested that he be buried in a simpler wooden coffin with a zinc interior.",
      "This is the coffin that will be seen in the funeral service.",
      "According to Monsignor Diego Ravelli, the Vatican's master of liturgical ceremonies, the request emphasised \"even more that the Roman Pontiff's funeral is that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world\".",
      "Why did Francis choose burial site?",
      "Pope Francis was a Jesuit - a Catholic religious order of priests known for their dedication to education and missionary work.",
      "He was also a devotee of the Virgin Mary and as such, he chose to be buried in Santa Maria Maggiore, which sits outside the Vatican walls in the centre of Rome.",
      "The church houses the Salus Populi Romani, a Byzantine icon of the Virgin believed to have been made by St Luke the Evangelist and used by Jesuit orders all over the world.",
      "In his will, written in 2022, Pope Francis said: \"Throughout my life, and during my ministry as a priest and bishop, I have always entrusted myself to the Mother of Our Lord, the Blessed Virgin Mary.\"",
      "\"I wish my final earthly journey to end precisely in this ancient Marian sanctuary, where I would always stop to pray at the beginning and end of every Apostolic Journey, confidently entrusting my intentions to the Immaculate Mother, and giving thanks for her gentle and maternal care,\" he wrote.",
      "On his first day as Pope in 2013, Francis left the Vatican to pray in Santa Maria Maggiore.",
      "Seven popes are buried in the same basilica in ornamented tombs, however, the Argentinian pontiff asked that his tomb would be in the side aisle, between the Pauline Chapel (Chapel of Salus Populi Romani) and the Sforza Chapel, close to a statue known as the Mary Regina Pacis (Mary, Queen of Peace).",
      "\"Near that Queen of Peace, to whom I have always turned for help and whose embrace I have sought more than a hundred times during my pontificate,\" he explained in his will.",
      "The Pope also asked that his tomb would be in the ground, simple and bearing only the inscription \"Franciscus\", the Latin version of his chosen name.",

    "summary": "Humanoid robots are attracting a lot of investment but will China dominate the industry?",
    "story": [
      "It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot.",
      "I have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows.",
      "Standing at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral.",
      "Today the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager.",
      "He explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions.",
      "Passers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room.",
      "They reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease.",
      "Unitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form.",
      "The potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises.",
      "It could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher.",
      "But the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe.",
      "Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem.",
      "To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous.",
      "So much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine.",
      "\"The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,\" a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC.",
      "\"Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning \u2013 such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way \u2013 a challenge,\" they said.",
      "At the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development.",
      "For now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories.",
      "The highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. In January he said that \"several thousand\" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing \"useful things\" in Tesla factories.",
      "Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.",
      "Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.",
      "Mr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market.",
      "\"The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],\" he says.",
      "Unitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (\u00a312,500).",
      "Also, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations.",
      "In a recent report STIQ notes that almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest.",
      "Chinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government.",
      "For example, in Shanghai there is a state-backed training facility for robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks.",
      "So how can US and European robot makers compete with that?",
      "Bristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot.",
      "While the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia.",
      "\"The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place.",
      "\"So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia.\"",
      "As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form.",
      "Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs.",
      "\"All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?\" he asks.",
      "Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter.",
      "\"My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,\" he says.",
      "Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real \"secret sauce\" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans.",
      "\"A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it.",
      "\"What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,\" Mr Pierce says.",
      "He says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times.",
      "The KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year.",
      "So will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off.",
      "\"My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task,\" says Mr Pierce.",

    "story": [
      "Israel's destructive military campaign in Gaza has released a silent killer: asbestos.",
      "The mineral, once widely-used in building materials, releases toxic fibres into the air when disturbed that can cling to the lungs and - over decades - cause cancer.",
      "Nowadays, its use is banned across much of the world, but it is still present in many older buildings.",
      "In Gaza, it is found primarily in asbestos roofing used across the territory's eight urban refugee camps - which were set up for Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes during the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war - according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).",
      "In October 2024, UNEP estimated that up to 2.3 million tons of rubble across Gaza could be contaminated with asbestos.",
      "\"The Gaza rubble is a very, very toxic environment,\" says Professor Bill Cookson, director of the National Centre for Mesothelioma Research in London. \"People are going to suffer acutely, but also in the longer term as well, things that children may carry throughout their lives.\"",
      "\"The lives lost now are not going to end here. The legacy is going to continue,\" says Liz Darlison, CEO of Mesothelioma UK.",
      "When asbestos is disturbed by something like an air strike, its fibres - too small to see with the human eye - can be breathed in by those nearby and can then work their way through to the lining of the lungs.",
      "Over many years - usually decades - they can cause scarring which leads to a serious lung condition known as asbestosis, or, in some cases, an aggressive form of lung-cancer named mesothelioma.",
      "\"Mesothelioma is a terrible, intractable illness,\" says Prof Cookson.",
      "\"The really worrying thing,\" he adds, \"is that it's not dose related. So even small inhalations of asbestos fibre can cause subsequent mesothelioma.",
      "\"It grows within the pleural cavity. It's extremely painful. It's always diagnosed late. And it's pretty well resistant to all treatments.\"",
      "Typically, those who contract mesothelioma do so 20 to 60 years after exposure - meaning it will take decades before the possible impact across the territory is felt. A higher level, or longer period, of exposure is believed to accelerate the progression of the disease.",
      "Dr Ryan Hoy, whose research into dust inhalation was cited by the UNEP, says it is extremely difficult to avoid breathing in asbestos fibres because they are \"really tiny particles that float in the air that can get very, very deep into the lungs.\"",
      "They are even harder to avoid, he says, because Gaza is so \"densely populated\". The territory houses approximately 2.1 million people and is 365 sq km (141 sq miles) - about one quarter of the size of London.",
      "Gaza in maps: How 15 months of war have drastically changed the territory",
      "Gaza war death toll could be significantly higher, researchers say",
      "Experts on the ground there say people are unable to manage the risks posed by asbestos or dust inhalation due to the more immediate dangers of Israel's military offensive.",
      "\"At this point in time, [dust inhalation] is not something that is perceived as a worrying thing by the population. They even don't have things to eat, and they're more afraid to be killed by the bombs,\" says Chiara Lodi, medical co-ordinator in Gaza for the NGO M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.",
      "\"The lack of awareness about the risks of asbestos, combined with the ongoing challenges [people in Gaza] face in trying to rebuild their lives, means they are unable to take the necessary measures to protect themselves,\" a Gaza-based spokesperson for the NGO SOS Children's Villages said.",
      "Many are \"not fully aware of the harmful effects of the dust and debris\", they added.",
      "After a previous conflict in Gaza in 2009, a UN survey of the territory found asbestos in debris from older buildings, sheds, temporary building extensions, roofs and the walls of livestock enclosures.",
      "There are several types of asbestos ranging from so-called \"white asbestos\", which is the least dangerous, to \"blue\", or crocidolite, which is the most. Highly-carcinogenic crocidolite asbestos was previously found in Gaza by the UN.",
      "Globally, around 68 countries have banned the use of asbestos, though some maintain exemptions for special use. It was banned in the UK in 1999, and Israel banned its use in buildings in 2011.",
      "As well as mesothelioma, asbestos can cause other forms of lung cancer, larynx and ovarian cancer.",
      "A further, lesser known risk is that of silicosis, a lung disease caused by breathing in silica dust, usually over many years. Concrete generally contains 20-60% silica.",
      "Dr Hoy says the sheer amount of dust in Gaza could lead to an \"increased risk of respiratory tract infections, upper and lower airway infections, pneumonia, exacerbations of pre-existing lung disease like asthma,\" as well as, \"emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which can be worsened by acute exposure to dust\".",
      "For years, the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York have been used as a case-study by health experts to examine the effects of a large toxic dust-cloud on a civilian population.",
      "\"The Twin Towers were not in the middle of a war zone,\" says Ms Darlison, \"so it was something we were able to measure and quantify easier\".",
      "As of December 2023, 5,249 of those who were registered with the US government's World Trade Center Health Programme have died as a result of aerodigestive illness or cancer - a far higher figure than the 2,296 people who were killed in the attack itself. A total of 34,113 people were diagnosed with cancer over the same period.",
      "The US and a group of Arab States have proposed competing plans for the reconstruction of Gaza. The UN has warned that the process will have to be managed carefully to avoid disturbing the vast amounts of asbestos-contaminated rubble.",
      "\"Unfortunately,\" says Ms Darlison, \"the very properties that made us use so much of it are the properties that make it difficult to get rid of.\"",
      "A UNEP spokesperson told the BBC that the debris removals process will \"increase the likelihood of asbestos disturbance and the release of hazardous fibres into the air\".",
      "A UNEP assessment indicated that clearing all debris could take 21 years and cost up to $1.2 billion (\u00a3929m).",

    "story": [
      "Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (\u00a3580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate.",
      "The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots.",
      "China's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen as retaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance?",
      "What are rare earth minerals and why are they important?",
      "Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named \"rare\" because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine.",
      "Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades \u2013 including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems.",
      "Albanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt.",
      "Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining \u2013 which makes them usable in technology \u2013 takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply.",
      "And that has spooked Western governments.",
      "Why is China restricting the export of rare earth minerals?",
      "Beijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%.",
      "But analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened.",
      "Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had \"dropped the ball\" on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement.",
      "\"China has its foot on the blood vein\u2026 of US and European defence systems,\" he added.",
      "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies.",
      "Could Australia's proposal change the game?",
      "Albanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both \"domestic industry and international partners\", in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU.",
      "But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as \"long overdue\", added that the proposal is \"not going to solve the problem\".",
      "The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China.",
      "Lithium \u2013 not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels \u2013 is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition.",
      "Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths.",
      "But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington.",
      "How will the US and China respond?",
      "China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump.",
      "In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to \"join hands\" with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected.",
      "Australia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products.",
      "But analysts say Albanese's proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China.",
      "Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese's plan was \"more sophisticated\" than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia's resources at moments of economic tension.",
      "If China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices.",
      "But she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China.",
      "\"If [Australia's] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West \u2013 especially the US \u2013 there are weak spots China can enter \u2013 and the most important is refining.\"",

      "On the streets of Gaza, more and more Palestinians are expressing open defiance against the armed group that's ruled the strip for almost 20 years.",
      "Many hold Hamas responsible for plunging the tiny, impoverished territory into the worst crisis faced by Palestinians in more than 70 years.",
      "\"Deliver the message,\" another crowd chants, as it surges through Gaza's devastated streets: \"Hamas is garbage.\"",
      "\"The world is deceived by the situation in the Gaza Strip,\" says Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza lawyer and former organiser of the 2019 anti-Hamas \"We Want to Live\" movement.",
      "Al-Natour spoke to us from the shattered remains of his city, the flimsy canvas side of the tent which now forms part of his house billowing behind him.",
      "\"The world thinks that Gaza is Hamas and Hamas is Gaza,\" he said. \"We didn't choose Hamas and now Hamas is determined to rule Gaza and tie our fate to its own. Hamas must retreat. \"",
      "Speaking out is dangerous. Hamas has never tolerated dissent. Al-Natour seems undaunted, writing a furious column for the Washington Post at the end of March.",
      "\"To support Hamas is to be for Palestinian death,\" he wrote, \"not Palestinian freedom\".",
      "Wasn't it dangerous to speak out in this way, I asked him.",
      "\"We need to take a risk and speak out,\" he replied without hesitation.",
      "\"I'm 30 years old. When Hamas took over, I was 11. What have I done with my life? My life has been wasted between war and escalating violence for nothing.\"",
      "Since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 by violently ousting political rivals, a year after winning national elections, there have been three major wars with Israel and two smaller conflicts.",
      "\"Humanity demands that we raise our voices,\" al-Natour said, \"despite suppression by Hamas\".",
      "Hamas may be busy fighting Israel, but it's not afraid to punish its critics.",
      "At the end of March, 22-year old Oday al-Rubai was abducted by armed gunmen from a refugee shelter in Gaza City.",
      "Hours later, his body was found covered in horrific wounds.",
      "The Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights said Oday had been tortured, calling his death \"a grave violation of the right to life and an extrajudicial killing\".",
      "Al-Rubai had participated in recent anti-Hamas protests. His family blamed Hamas for his death and demanded justice.",
      "Days earlier, a frightened al-Rubai posted a dark, grainy video on social media in which he expressed his fear that Hamas militants were coming for him.",
      "\"Gaza has become a city of ghosts,\" he said, glancing over his shoulder.",
      "\"I'm stranded in the street, not knowing where to go. I don't know why they're after me. They destroyed us and brought ruin to us.\"",
      "At his funeral, a small crowd demanded revenge and repeated demands for Hamas to get out of Gaza.",
      "Last summer, Amin Abed almost suffered the same fate, following his decision to speak out against Hamas.",
      "Masked militants beat him senseless, broke bones all over his body and damaged his kidneys. Abed survived but had to seek medical treatment abroad.",
      "Now living in Dubai, he's still involved in the protest movement, and believes that Hamas' authority is diminished.",
      "\"Hamas' power has begun to fade,\" he told me.",
      "\"It targets activists and civilians, beats and kills them to scare people. But it's not how it was before.\"",
      "Before the ceasefire collapsed last month, Hamas fighters seemed intent on highly visible displays of power.",
      "But now, with Israel once again attacking relentlessly, the same gunmen have retreated underground and Gaza's civilians have been plunged back into the misery of war.",
      "Some of the more recent protests suggest that civilians, driven to the edge of madness by a year and a half of Israeli bombardment, are losing their fear of Hamas.",
      "Beit Lahiya, at the northern end of the Gaza Strip, has seen some of the most vociferous opposition.",
      "In a series of voice notes, an eyewitness \u2013 who asked not to be named \u2013 described several recent incidents in which local residents prevented Hamas fighters from carrying out military actions from inside their community.",
      "On 13 April, he said, Hamas gunmen tried to force their way into the house of an elderly man, Jamal al-Maznan.",
      "\"They wanted to launch rockets and pipes [a derogatory term used for some of Hamas' home-made projectiles] from inside his house,\" the eyewitness told us.",
      "\"But he refused.\"",
      "The incident soon escalated, with relatives and neighbours all coming to al-Maznan's defence. The gunmen opened fire, injuring several people, but eventually were driven out.",
      "\"They were not intimidated by the bullets,\" the eyewitness said of the protesters.",

      "It also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.",
      "The College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.",

      "PROFILE: Acting head of the Vatican Cardinal Kevin Farrell",
      "VISUAL GUIDE: How the next Pope is chosen by secret vote",
      "Pietro Parolin",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 70",
      "Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.",
      "Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.",
      "He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.",
      "But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".",
      "The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"",
      "Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.",
      "Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle",
      "Nationality: Filipino",
      "Age: 67",
      "Could the next pope come from Asia?",
      "Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.",
      "The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.",
      "He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.",
      "He has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.",
      "But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.",
      "The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.",
      "Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"",
      "Fridolin Ambongo Besungu",
      "Nationality: Congolese",
      "Age: 65",
      "It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).",
      "He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.",
      "He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.",
      "But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"",
      "Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.",
      "Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson",
      "Nationality: Ghanaian",
      "Age: 76",
      "If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.",
      "Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.",
      "Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".",
      "He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.",
      "Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.",
      "A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.",
      "Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.",
      "In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.",
      "In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.",
      "Peter Erdo",
      "Nationality: Hungarian",
      "Age: 72",
      "A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.",
      "He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.",
      "The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.",
      "Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.",
      "His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.",
      "Angelo Scola",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 83",
      "Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.",
      "The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.",
      "His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".",
      "Francis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.",
      "Reinhard Marx",
      "Nationality: German",
      "Age: 71",
      "Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.",
      "The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.",
      "He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.",
      "But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.",
      "Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.",
      "Marc Ouellet",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 80",
      "Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.",
      "For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.",
      "Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.",
      "He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".",
      "Robert Prevost",
      "Nationality: American",
      "Age: 69",
      "Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?",
      "Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.",
      "Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.",
      "He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.",
      "Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.",
      "He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.",
      "Robert Sarah",
      "Nationality: Guinean",
      "Age: 79",
      "Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.",
      "The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.",
      "He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.",
      "While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.",
      "Pierbattista Pizzaballa",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 60",
      "Ordained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since.",
      "Pope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as \"the heart of the life of this world\".",
      "Fellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.",
      "However, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction.",
      "Michael Czerny",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 78",
      "Cardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.",
      "Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.",
      "He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.",
      "Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development.",
      "Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession.",

    "story": [
      "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing.",
      "Chinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".",
      "Here's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "China can take the pain (to a point)",
      "China is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.",
      "With more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.",
      "Beijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change.",
      "And Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.",
      "The leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.",
      "China also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.",
      "Still, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.",
      "The economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.",
      "The Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".",
      "President Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"",
      "China has been investing in the future",
      "China has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.",
      "Under Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance.",
      "It has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI.",
      "Examples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.",
      "Recently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.",
      "US companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Chinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.",
      "That unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.",
      "Designed in US, made in China: Why Apple is stuck",
      "Trump's tariffs leave China's neighbours with an impossible choice",
      "Lessons from Trump 1.0",
      "Ever since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order.",
      "It has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "The expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.",
      "American farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier.",
      "\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute.",
      "The US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.",
      "That doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y65nw5lgvo",
    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 23:13:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Despite having the world's fastest-growing Catholic population, odds are against Africa producing the next pontiff.",
    "story": [
      "If the sole predictor of who would become the next pope was where the Catholic Church is growing fastest, then it is almost certain he would hail from Africa.",
      "The continent's Catholic population is expanding more rapidly than anywhere else, representing more than half of the global increase.",
      "While there have been at least three pontiffs from Africa, the last - Pope Gelasius I - died more than 1,500 years ago, many would argue it is high time for another.",
      "When the cardinals who vote for the leader of the Roman Catholic Church - known as the cardinal-electors - meet at the Vatican to choose Pope Francis' successor, will these facts influence their decision making?",
      "\"I think that it will be great to have an African pope,\" Father Stan Chu Ilo, a Nigerian Catholic priest and associate professor at DePaul University in Chicago, told the BBC, arguing that the leadership of the Church should better reflect the make-up of the global congregation.",
      "But the cleric admitted it was more likely that the cardinals would pick someone who already had a high profile - \"someone who is already an influential voice\".",
      "\"The challenge is that you don't have any senior African clergy holding any important position today at the Vatican, and that poses a problem,\" he said.",
      "However, he also said that: \"Cardinal [Robert] Sarah of Guinea and Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo [Besungu] of DR Congo have become prominent voices in global Catholicism within the last two years.\"",
      "And he noted that Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson had held different roles at the Vatican, endearing him to many people around the world.",
      "He remains a strong contender for the position, while in 2005 Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze was also a potential candidate in the conclave that led to the election of Pope Benedict XVI.",
      "This is despite Pope Francis increasing the proportion of cardinals from sub-Saharan Africa from 8% when he was elected in 2013 to 12% a decade later, according to US-based Pew Research Center.",
      "\"How it has come to this point for the continent of Africa and the Catholic Church is still something that surprises many of us, given Pope Francis's openness to Africa,\" Fr Chu Ilo said.",
      "Francis visited 10 countries in Africa during his pontificate - a time that marked a dramatic increase in the number of Catholics on the continent. The latest figures show there were 281 million Catholics in Africa in 2023, making up 20% of the worldwide congregation.",
      "But some African Catholics do not like this emphasis on origin - like Father Paulinus Ikechukwu Odozor, a professor at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.",
      "For the Nigerian-born Catholic priest it just smacks of tokenism.",
      "\"It's like people are saying, 'OK, so Africans are growing in these numbers, so why don't we give them a pope,'\" he told me.",
      "\"I have never been one to think that just because you come from Africa, or because you come from Europe, therefore you are prime candidate.",
      "\"No matter where you come from, as soon as you are elected, everybody's issues become your issue.  You have one concern, to build up the body of Christ, no matter where the people are, no matter how many they are, in whatever context they are.\"",
      "The most important thing, he told the BBC, was for the pope to be \"the chief theologian of the Church\".",
      "\"The pope must be somebody who knows tradition very well\" and was able to use that to give people direction, he said.",
      "In his view, more needs to be done to ensure that matters affecting the faithful in Africa are taken seriously by those in positions of power at the Vatican.",
      "He admitted that at times it felt \"as if Africans don't matter, or it's as if their faith is seen as a little bit below par, or counterfeit, and should not be taken seriously\".",
      "\"When Africans feel that their issues are not on the table as they should be, then people begin to ask, well, maybe we can only get ourselves heard or seen if we have our own man there.\"",
      "Pope Francis has been praised for his understanding of the poor and marginalised - which made him particularly loved in Africa.",
      "For example, he spoke out against what he saw as the plundering of natural resources in places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, a vast country which is home to Africa's largest Catholic community with almost 55 million believers.",
      "His role as peacemaker has also been commended - he went to great lengths to heal divisions following the brutal civil war in the Central African Republic, famously giving a ride on his popemobile to the imam who invited him to pray at a mosque in Bangui in 2015. He also kissed the feet of South Sudan's rival leaders four years later in an attempt to end that country's civil war.",
      "But Pope Francis did face a backlash from the African Church for his stance on LGBT issues.",
      "Africa bishops rejected his 2023 declaration allowing priests to offer blessings to same-sex couples.",
      "The Vatican clarified that the blessings \"neither approve nor justify the situation in which these people find themselves\", and that \"in several countries there are strong cultural and even legal issues that require time and pastoral strategies that go beyond the short term\".",
      "It is an issue that seems to unite the continent, where homosexual relationships are outlawed in many countries.",
      "The three African cardinals, mentioned by observers as possible, if not top, contenders - Turkson, Sarah and Besungu - are all clear in their rejection of a change on this issue.",
      "Congolese Cardinal Besungu has said \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Cardinal Sarah, an arch traditionalist, has been damning about the West's liberal attitudes, telling a Synod in 2015: \"What Nazi-Fascism and Communism were in the 20th Century, Western homosexual and abortion ideologies and Islamic fanaticism are today.\"",
      "And while Cardinal Turkson has been critical of Ghana's move to impose harsh penalties on LGBT people, he toes the line that same-sex relationships are \"objectively sinful\".",
      "Nonetheless Fr Odozor agreed that despite an increase in the number of cardinals from the African continent, they lack real power in the Church.",
      "And both clerics interviewed by the BBC pointed to an issue that could hinder efforts that Pope Francis had made to make the leadership of the Church more representative - and the possibility of getting a pontiff from Africa.",
      "\"There is still that question of racism in the Church that we never even talk about,\" Fr Odozor said.",
      "\"That could undermine someone, no matter how papal he is or what he does, he will be seen simply as an African pope.\"",
      "As Pope Francis appointed 108 of the 135 cardinals eligible to vote in the conclave, there is a good chance they will choose someone whose emphasis is also on reaching out to the poor and disenfranchised.",
      "It is an approach Fr Chu Ilo called a \"poor-first\" outlook, with a focus on being \"a listening Church\".",
      "But, as when Pope Francis was elected, he said the outcome would be unpredictable.",
      "\"I will answer like a good priest,\" he told me chuckling, when asked for his prediction.",
      "\"I would pray that God will give us a pope who will continue with the outlook of Francis, and I'll pray that such a person comes from Africa.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 12:54:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Tundu Lissu has survived against the political odds over the years but has now been charged with treason.",
    "story": [
      "Shot 16 times in an assassination attempt in 2017, Tundu Lissu is the great survivor of Tanzanian politics - and one of its most persecuted politicians.",
      "But some are asking whether he has now reached the the end of the line.",
      "Lissu, the leader of the main opposition party, Chadema, is back in the limelight after being charged with treason - a crime for which the maximum sentence is the death penalty.",
      "Still, he is undeterred. Despite the enormous risk, he believes he can pressure the government to institute reforms, ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections in October.",
      "But can he weather the storm in a harsh political environment, and against what he believes are politically driven charges?",
      "His party has been disqualified from the elections and he has been in detention for the past two weeks.",
      "In September last year, Lissu told the BBC that nothing would come on a silver platter, and it would take courage to demand reforms \"on the streets and in the villages\".",
      "To achieve his goals, he felt he had to take over Chadema's leadership.",
      "A fiery politician, Lissu was critical of the way the party was being run, accusing then chairman Freeman Mbowe of being too reconciliatory towards the government.",
      "In an intense race, he ousted Mbowe from the post.",
      "After just three months at the helm of Chadema, Lissu was this month arrested and detained for a speech allegedly calling for the public to launch a rebellion and disrupt the elections.",
      "He was not allowed to enter a plea on the treason charge but pleaded not guilty to a separate charge of publishing false information.",
      "Prior to his arrest, he had been holding gatherings across the country with a rallying call of \"no reforms, no elections\".",
      "He said the current system was rigged in favour of the ruling CCM party, adding that without reforms, there was no point in taking part in the elections.",
      "He was due to appear at Kisutu magistrates' court in Dar es Salaam on Thursday. There was tight security around the court and elsewhere in the city.",
      "Chadema said more of party officials, including deputy chairman John Heche and secretary general John Mnyika, were arrested on their way to the court.",
      "The court ordered the case to be heard virtually but Lissu did not appear before it, with the case going on in the presence of his lawyers. The hearing will continue on Monday.",
      "Lissu cannot seek bail because he has been charged with treason.",
      "His international lawyer, Robert Amsterdam, told the BBC that it was their \"mission to defend democracy\".",
      "Yet it is no simple task - CCM has won every election since independence, and is unlikely to easily let go of its stranglehold on power.",
      "There is also a rift in Chadema, with some members disagreeing with Lissu's strategy.",
      "The party is barred from contesting October's election after it refused to comply with the electoral commission's requirement to sign a code of conduct.",
      "The document's key objective \"is to ensure that political parties and their supporters behave well... and maintain peace and harmony\" during the elections.",
      "Chadema sees the code of conduct as a ploy to contain the opposition, and it fears that state repression will continue.",
      "In September a senior Chadema party official was abducted and brutally killed amid a wave of abductions of government critics.",
      "During local elections in November, Chadema said thousands of its candidates were barred from participating. The ruling party won about 98% of the seats.",
      "The government dismissed suggestions that the elections were not free and fair, saying they were held in accordance with the rules.",
      "But for Lissu, the local elections justified his calls for reforms ahead of the presidential and parliamentary polls.",

      "Tanzania's main opposition party banned from election",

      "Campaign group Human Rights Watch has expressed similar fears, and has urged the government to end political repression.",
      "The Catholic Church has added its voice to calls for the unconditional release of Lissu, and for fair elections.",
      "But the arrest of opposition politicians has continued, despite Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa promising earlier this month that the authorities would ensure security and fairness in the polls.",
      "The BBC has reached out to the government for comment.",
      "President Samia Suluhu Hassan gave Tanzanians greater political freedom after she took office following the death in office of her predecessor John Magufuli in 2021.",
      "However, Tanzania was once again \"beginning to see the wave of repression and state-orchestrated violence\" that characterised Magufuli's rule, Tanzanian political analyst Nicodemus Minde said.",
      "It was during that era that Lissu survived an assassination attempt.",
      "Before his arrest, Lissu said his party had a list of \"minimum but critical reforms that must be made to guarantee free elections\".",
      "Mr Amsterdam, his lawyer, told the BBC that this included the formation of \"a truly independent national electoral commission with members unconnected to the government\" - and this must be enshrined in the constitution.",
      "Chadema is also demanding that when there are electoral disputes, the burden of proof should lie with the commission to show that the vote was free and fair.",
      "Lissu's strategy has come at a heavy cost to himself and Chadema, as a faction within the party, known as G-55,  has adopted a softer stance.",
      "It has called for the party to contest the elections while pursuing talks with the government over its demands.",
      "That is the approach taken by the second largest opposition party, ACT-Wazalendo.",
      "Along with 16 fringe opposition parties, it has signed the code of conduct. Only Chadema has refused.",
      "Lissu appears to see neighbouring Kenya - where mass protests last year forced the government to drop plans to increase taxes - as a model to follow.",
      "At the time, he told the BBC that Tanzanians had not \"pressed hard enough for democratic reform\", and what Kenya went through in order to get [its] democratic dispensation is something that we need to do\".",
      "Whether such a strategy would work is unclear, as many Tanzanians appear reluctant to publicly support a campaign that could rattle the government.",
      "But Mr Amsterdam said the more intransigent the government, the more it would spur Chadema's supporters \"to push forward and engage in civil disobedience\".",
      "He added that Chadema would use \"every legal and political tool\" to achieve change.",
      "But political analyst Thomas Kibwana criticised Lissu's strategy, saying that with the term of the current parliament due to end in June there would not be enough time to give legal effect to any major reforms ahead of the October election.",
      "He said it might be better for Chadema to wait until after the election.",
      "Fulgence Massawe, the director of a legal rights organisation in Tanzania, told the BBC that Chadema's push for electoral reforms faced significant hurdles, but the party had the right to go to court to challenge its exclusion from the elections.",
      "Mr Minde said that if Chadema remained shut out of the elections, the ruling party is likely to increase its already overwhelming majority in parliament.",
      "The analyst added that Chadema might even lose its standing as the main opposition party, and \"of course nature pulls back and probably other opposition parties will seize this opportunity\".",
      "It is a risk that Lissu and the party have chosen to take.",

      "\"The surgery worked. I became more confident and happier, day by day. I think my mum made the right call.\"",

    "summary": "A total of 370 out of 882 Indian laws criminalise 7,305 acts - from missed dog walks to murder.",
    "story": [
      "In India, you can face criminal charges for tethering an animal on the street, flying a kite in a manner that causes alarm, skipping a school attendance order or handing a feeding bottle to a mother who can't breastfeed.",
      "Of the 882 federal laws on the books, 370 contain criminal provisions - together criminalising 7,305 acts and omissions. These range from the absurd to the serious: failing to give a month's notice before quitting your job or not walking your dog enough, to offences like illegal arms possession, murder and sexual assault.",
      "Delhi-based think-tank Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy calls it \"India's crisis of over-criminalisation\".",
      "In a new report, The State of the System: Understanding the Scale of Crime and Punishment in India, the think-tank has produced the country's first comprehensive database of crimes, mapping the extent of criminalisation across 370 federal laws.",
      "The report flags India's habit of reaching for criminal law to solve just about everything - even the mundane. It notes that many laws criminalise \"routine, everyday actions\".",
      "You could, for instance, be charged for tethering your goat on a public street, fixing a leaky tap without a licence or not naming the owner of a building when asked.",
      "Then there are the truly obscure offences - like a parent ignoring a school attendance order, applying for a driver's licence when banned or littering in a zoo. Basically, there's a criminal penalty waiting around every corner of daily life.",
      "Let your pigs wander on to a field or road and you could be fined 10 rupees (12 cents). Disturb an animal or litter in a zoo? Six months in jail or a 2,000-rupee fine. And failing to exercise your dog can cost you up to 100 rupees and three months in jail.",
      "Promoting infant milk substitutes or feeding bottles to pregnant women or mothers can lead to up to three years in jail or a 5,000-rupee fine. (This was meant to curb aggressive marketing by formula food companies, but the law also applies to individuals, which makes it controversial.)",
      "Jail is the go-to punishment in India - 73% of crimes carry prison terms ranging from a single day to 20 years.",
      "More than 250 offences across 117 laws penalise delays in filing documents - everything from wealth and property tax returns to gift declarations, the report finds.",
      "Some 124 crimes across 80 laws criminalise obstructing a public officer, often without clearly defining what causes \"obstruction\".",
      "Even the death penalty isn't off the table - not just for murder or mutiny, but for damaging an oil or gas pipeline or a sentry caught sleeping on duty. In all, a staggering 301 offences in India can legally cost you your life.",
      "Out of 7,305 offences under central laws, nearly 80% come with fines - from as low as two rupees to a staggering 50m rupees.",
      "To be fair, many of these provisions are rarely used - India's crime records bureau tracks around 50 laws, even though 370 carry criminal penalties.",
      "\"They're not heavily enforced, but they create ample opportunities for rent-seeking,\" Naveed Mehmood Ahmad, co-author of the study at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, told me.",
      "\"There's enough in the books to jail almost anyone for some technical non-compliance. It's less about actual use and more about the potential for misuse.\"",
      "This \"excessive use of criminal law not only disrupts the daily lives of ordinary citizens but also creates significant barriers for business operations\", the report says.",
      "Businesses in India face a maze of regulations, but using criminal law as the default for non-compliance is excessive, disproportionate and often counter-productive, experts say.",
      "The report also talks about some glaring inconsistencies in crime and punishment.",
      "Rioting - the use of force or violence by an unlawful assembly - is punishable with up to two years of imprisonment. Meanwhile, falsely reporting a birth or death for official records can lead to three years of imprisonment.",
      "The irony? Violence in public gets a lighter sentence than a lie on paper.",
      "Even more striking: crimes of vastly different severity carry the same penalty - like practicing homoeopathy without a licence, jumping a red light, or forcing someone into labour - all punishable with a one-year sentence.",
      "The sheer number of crimes tied to everyday life and business shows how heavily the state leans on criminalisation to enforce compliance, the report says.",
      "\"This over-reliance has significant costs, not just for citizens and businesses, but also for state machinery.\"",
      "Over 34 million criminal cases are pending in India's courts, with 72% stuck for more than a year. Prisons are overcrowded, running at 131% capacity, while courts and police forces continue to grapple with chronic staff shortages",
      "Even the law-and-order machinery is stretched. As of 1 January 2023, India had just 154 police personnel per 100,000 people - well below the sanctioned 195. Nationwide, there are 581,000 vacancies against an approved strength of 2.72 million.",
      "\"Even then, we continue to rely on this overburdened system to combat minor infractions, including those that attract nominal fines,\" the report says.",
      "It says that criminal law should be limited to acts that threaten core societal values - like public safety, national security, life, liberty, property and social harmony.",
      "Authorities say they plan to scrap criminal penalties in more than 100 legal provisions - on top of the 180 already axed in 2023. It's not just legal clean-up; it's a chance to rethink how the law treats people. Less fear, more trust. Less suspect, more citizen."

      "Pope Francis visited the Holy Land in 2014. A defining image of his trip came at an unscheduled stop off in Bethlehem when he prayed for peace by the graffitied wall that forms part of Israel's West Bank barrier.",
      "On Sunday in his Easter message, his last public appearance, he was again calling for peace and a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "With his words read by an aide, he said: \"The terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation.''",
      "\"War is not just weapons.  War is sometimes words,\" the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, said when I asked him about the Pope's final address.  He said the Pope had a moral clarity.",
      "\"Pope Francis recently, especially in the last year, has been very outspoken about the situation of the Holy Land, calling for the liberation of the hostages, but also condemning the dramatic situation, the ongoing war in Gaza and the situation for Palestinians,\" the cardinal said.",
      "Israeli media has noted that while President Isaac Herzog expressed condolences to the Catholic world, there were not similar comments from the prime minister or foreign minister as would have been expected - widely attributed to the Pope's strong positions against the Gaza war.",
      "Some of his most explicit criticism of Israel came late last year when excerpts of an upcoming book were published.",
      "\"According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,\" Pope Francis wrote.",
      "\"It should be carefully investigated to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies.\"",
      "Israel firmly rejects allegations of genocide in Gaza and says its war goal is to defeat Hamas.",
      "As a conclave gets under way in Rome this week to decide Pope Francis's successor, Palestinians and Israelis will be watching closely to see what the next Pope has to say about their intractable conflict.",
      "Christians in Gaza say they hope that whoever is chosen will be pushing for peace."

      "It came as a surprise to many \u2013 including Bergoglio himself \u2013 that he was elected to the highest office in the Catholic Church in the first place.",
      "At 76 years old at the time - one year older than the typical age of bishops and cardinals when they submit their resignation to the pope - he was not seen as a real candidate to fill the vacancy, according to analysts.",
      "\"When he left Buenos Aires for the conclave, he seemed somewhat sad; he was getting ready to retire in a room at the Priests' Home in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Flores,\" Guillermo Marc\u00f3, a priest from the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, told Argentine newspaper Clar\u00edn.",
      "However, Bergoglio would soon begin a papacy that lasted 12 years.",
      "His death has been particularly keenly felt in his home country, where seven days of national mourning have been declared - as Argentina grieves a man many regarded as simple and humble, despite holding one of the most powerful offices in the world.",
      "Those qualities were praised by Elenir Ramazol, a nun who spoke to BBC Mundo  during a vigil at the Buenos Aires cathedral on Monday.",
      "The fact he did not return to his homeland was \"a sign of the total commitment he made to the whole Church, not just to his people, to his country\", Ms Ramazol said.",
      "Gustavo Vera exchanged hundreds of letters with Francis, having become friends with him when he was still archbishop. He agreed that the pontiff always showed an enduring interest in what was happening in his home country.",
      "\"Sometimes he commented on soccer, sometimes on tango, sometimes on cultural events,\" Mr Vera, the leader of La Alameda, an Argentine anti-trafficking and slavery organisation, said. Francis followed Argentine news \"in detail\", he added.",
      "During his papacy, Francis visited four of the five countries that border Argentina - but never his home country, despite continuing to take a keen interest in it.",
      "He was loved by many there who now mourn him, but others remember him as a controversial figure.",
      "The initial pride felt by most Argentines after the announcement that a fellow countryman would be the first Latin American pope gave way to disenchantment among some over the years.",
      "A Pew Research Center survey suggested that the proportion of people who held a positive view of the pontiff fell from 91% in 2013 to 64% in 2024.",
      "Of six Latin American countries surveyed, the largest drop in favourable attitudes was recorded in Argentina.",
      "Conservatives in Argentina accused him of undermining historical traditions they held sacred, while reformers hoped for more profound changes.",
      "Critics felt he failed to do enough to oppose the country's brutal military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s and to criticise the complicity of some figures in the Church.",
      "Every time he was asked about a possible trip, Pope Francis gave vague answers.",
      "\"I would like to go. It's my people, but it hasn't been planned yet. There are several things to sort out first,\" he said the last time he was publicly asked about the subject, in September 2024.",
      "Some fellow Argentines found this hesitation difficult to understand.",
      "The pontiff's absence has been felt more acutely in recent years, as Argentina has endured a profound economic crisis, with annual inflation reaching nearly 300% and a sharp increase in poverty.",
      "Mr Vera suggests that Francis was planning to visit, but had not yet done so because he wanted to avoid his presence being used for political purposes.",
      "\"He always used to say he would go to Argentina when he felt that he was an instrument to bring about national unity, to help overcome the rift, to try to bring Argentines back together,\" Mr Vera said.",
      "The \"rift\" refers to the vast, decades-long gulf in Argentine politics and society between supporters and opponents of the populist political movement Peronism, founded by late President Juan Per\u00f3n in the 1940s.",
      "There is a widespread belief in the country that Pope Francis was a Peronist - something he denied in a book in 2023, while adding: \"If we had a Peronist conception of politics, what would be wrong with that?\"",
      "The comment was seized upon by conservative detractors who accused him of being too closely aligned with social justice causes and left-wing politics.",
      "Before taking office, Javier Milei, the current president who has demonised left-wing politics, even called Pope Francis \"the representation of evil on Earth\" - although he softened his tone after coming to power.",
      "The two had a cordial meeting in the Vatican and President Milei officially invited the pontiff to Argentina. And following the Pope's death, Milei said he was deeply pained by his loss, and praised the pontiff's benevolence and wisdom.",
      "Some Argentines accused him of being too close to Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, a divisive left-leaning populist politician, who was president from 2007 to 2015.",
      "But according to Mr Vera, the Pope met with people \"from the whole political and social spectrum of Argentina\".",
      "The late pontiff's friend also pointed out that, while there was some criticism of Pope Francis in the media and major urban centres, he was loved in other parts of the country.",
      "Although he maintained his connection with Argentina, Mr Vera said, Pope Francis no longer felt he belonged to just one country.",
      "\"Argentines believe he was Argentinian, but in reality, he was a citizen of the world,\" he added.",
      "It is a view shared by Alejandra Castro, a social worker who was among the mourners who gathered on Monday night at Buenos Aires cathedral.",
      "Argentina was \"always in his prayers\", Ms Castro said. \"In one way or another, he was always present, and I think that shows that in his heart, Argentina was always present.\"",
      "But Mr Vera acknowledged that not everyone felt the same way, and suggested it was up to Argentines to look within themselves for answers: \"Rather than blaming Francis, we Argentines should ask ourselves what we were doing that meant we did not deserve the Pope's visit.\"",

      "Pietro Parolin",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 70",
      "Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.",
      "Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.",

      "The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"",
      "Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.",

      "Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.",
      "The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.",
      "He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.",
      "He has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.",
      "But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.",
      "The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.",
      "Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"",

      "It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).",
      "He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.",
      "He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.",
      "But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"",

      "If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.",

      "Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.",
      "A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.",
      "Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.",
      "In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.",
      "In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.",
      "Peter Erdo",
      "Nationality: Hungarian",
      "Age: 72",
      "A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.",
      "He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.",
      "The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.",
      "Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.",
      "His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.",
      "Angelo Scola",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 83",
      "Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.",
      "The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.",
      "His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".",
      "Francis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.",
      "Reinhard Marx",
      "Nationality: German",
      "Age: 71",
      "Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.",
      "The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.",
      "He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.",
      "But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.",
      "Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.",
      "Marc Ouellet",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 80",
      "Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.",
      "For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.",
      "Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.",
      "He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".",
      "Robert Prevost",
      "Nationality: American",
      "Age: 69",
      "Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?",
      "Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.",
      "Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.",
      "He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.",
      "Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.",
      "He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.",
      "Robert Sarah",
      "Nationality: Guinean",
      "Age: 79",
      "Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.",
      "The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.",
      "He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.",
      "While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.",
      "Pierbattista Pizzaballa",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 60",
      "Ordained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since.",
      "Pope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as \"the heart of the life of this world\".",
      "Fellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.",
      "However, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction.",
      "Michael Czerny",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 78",
      "Cardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.",
      "Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.",
      "He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.",
      "Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development.",
      "Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession.",

    "story": [
      "Legendary trumpeter Herb Alpert celebrated his 90th birthday last month by taking the stage at Jazz at Lincoln Center with a new iteration of the Tijuana Brass, marking his return to the iconic group format for the first time in 40 years.",
      "The milestone performance coincides with the 60th anniversary of his landmark album \"Whipped Cream & Other Delights,\" which spent eight weeks at No. 1 after its 1965 release and helped define the sound of the era.",
      "\"It has been overwhelming. I didn't realize I'd get this much attention at 90,\" Alpert said.",
      "Alpert's distinctive brass sound, inspired by bullfights in Tijuana, dominated the 1960s music landscape \u2014 appearing in television commercials, game shows like \"The Dating Game,\" and films including \"Casino Royale.\" At his commercial peak in 1966, Alpert had three albums in the top five simultaneously and outsold The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Frank Sinatra.",
      "\"Sometimes I was even a little embarrassed by it all,\" Alpert admitted.",
      "His classic hit \"Ladyfingers\" recently found new life on TikTok, generating what Alpert described as \"three billion streams\" on YouTube, a phenomenon he finds \"strange, because I recorded it like 60 years ago.\"",
      "The trumpet virtuoso's career hasn't been without challenges. By 1969, while going through a divorce, Alpert faced a personal crisis with his instrument. He described the trumpet as \"my enemy\" as he struggled with confidence and technique. A breakthrough came after consulting New York brass teacher Carmine Caruso, who reminded him that the trumpet was \"just a piece of plumbing\" and that \"the instrument comes from deep inside you.\"",
      "Alpert also co-founded A&M Records with the late Jerry Moss, operating on a handshake agreement from 1962 until they sold the company in 1990. The two never signed a formal contract, a fact that still moves Alpert to tears when he recalls their partnership.",
      "Now touring with a newly assembled Tijuana Brass, Alpert says the music feels fresh again. Alpert continues to perform with his wife of 52 years, singer Lani Hall, whom he met when his label signed Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66.",
      "\"I try to be as authentic as I can when I play,\" he said. \"I'm playing in the moment of my life. And it's a hard place to get to. But that's the place I'm always looking for.\"",

    "story": [
      "All David Hyde Pierce has to do is step out on stage, and he gets applause, even before he launches into the idiotic tongue-twister from \"The Pirates of Penzance\":",
      "I am the very model of a modern Major-General,I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historicalFrom Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical",
      "With practically no expression on his face, babbling away, all kinds of commotion around him, he's funny.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think 'less is more' can be funny?\"",
      "\"Well, I think so much of theater, rightly, is MORE,\" Pierce replied. \"Sometimes, what's unexpected in theater is someone doing less.\"",
      "\"Is there a temptation to overact?\"",
      "\"Always,\" he said. \"You remind me of a great line from 'Frasier,' which was, 'If less is more, think how much more MORE will be!'\"",
      "It is thanks to his 11-year run on the TV mega-hit \"Frasier\" that Pierce has the recognition, and can afford to pick and choose his roles. He's the Major-General in \"Pirates! The Penzance Musical,\" a jazzy re-working of the Gilbert & Sullivan classic, transplanted to New Orleans.",
      "Pierce showed us one of the Gilbert & Sullivan scores from his summer camp from the 1970s (\"It's almost as old as I am\"), which was also the score he used for an episode of \"Frasier\" where he, Kelsey Grammer and David Ogden Stiers sang from \"Penzance.\"",
      "I asked, \"What does Gilbert & Sullivan mean to you?\"",
      "\"Hmm. Well, it must mean something, 'cause it's \u2026 I'm getting emotional,\" Pierce replied. \"Thinking about the question, I guess it's just, it's just because it's been threaded through my life for so long.\"",
      "In his dressing room at the Roundabout Theatre, the wall is covered with photographs of people who were in the dressing room before: \"Famous people, a lot of them dear friends of mine,\" he said. \"I'll be up there eventually. Tradition is very important to us. It's being aware that you're part of something bigger.\"",
      "Pierce's \"Pirates\" dressing room is full of nods to the emotional touchstones that define him, including one of the most important: a photograph of him talking to his dad about a show he was doing, \"at a time when I didn't even know that that's what I was going into, had no idea what was lying ahead,\" he said.",
      "Pierce's father and his grandfather were amateur performers. \"The disease runs in the family,\" he said. \"I just hadn't been diagnosed, I guess!\"",
      "He set out to be a concert pianist. He still plays every day, but decided to become an actor instead while he was a student at Yale.",
      "And what brought him to comedy? \"I think it has to do with what I was drawn to,\" Pierce said. \"I watched reruns of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show' and 'Mary Tyler Moore' and 'All in the Family.' When I was a teenager, 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' came to American television on PBS, and my head blew off. I loved Alec Guinness. Oh, and Buster Keaton. Oh my God, Buster Keaton!\"",
      "It's impossible not to see a hint of Buster Keaton in Pierce's famous ironing board scene from \"Frasier\":",
      "Pierce said, \"I do want people to be able to laugh.\"",
      "\"Why? What does that mean to you? Why is it important?\"",
      "\"I guess it's the perception of connection,\" he said. \"For example, doing a comic film is not nearly as enjoyable for me as doing a comic play. In a comic play, you feel from the audience the connection. That's what I'm in it for. That's where I started out. I love that.\"",
      "For almost as long as he's been in it, his partner along the way, his husband since 2008, has been actor-writer Brian Hargrove. They met at an audition, became friends, and only later discovered they were both gay. \"Brian had me over to dinner at his apartment to do my taxes,\" said Pierce.",
      "\"I used to have a tax business as well as an actor,\" said Hargrove.",
      "\"That's not a metaphor; that's actually what he was doing. Tax practitioner! And then we were going to see this movie, and it came up. We went back to his apartment, and then, as Brian puts it, I never left.\"",
      "That was in 1983. It was Hargrove who suggested moving to California, which led to Pierce being cast as Dr. Niles Crane alongside Kelsey Grammer in \"Frasier.\" Forty years, four Emmys and two Tonys later, he chose not to be in the \"Frasier\" reboot. At the time he was playing Julia Child's husband, Paul, on HBO. \"I've been very happy with what originally came to me, and then when I've been able to make choices in my career and the choices I've made,\" Pierce said. \"My creativity is fueled by change and by diversity.\"",
      "Which is why David Hyde Pierce said yes to \"Pirates\" \u2013 and a new chance to make people laugh in one of his old favorites.",

      "\"Never shy around us,\" Knowles said. \"At home, she was entertaining. She was singing, she was dancing and she was doing all the things that I did. \u2026 So she would get quiet until she got to know you.\"",
      "A former teacher told Knowles in her evaluation that Beyonc\u00e9 was a bright student.",

      "When Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange were 12 and 7 years old, Knowles put them in therapy together. It was a controversial decision within her own family as her then husband, Mathew Knowles, objected.",

Or that I would be doing hair and all the things I did for our group and even the rehearsals and the discipline of that and the harmonies \u2026 I got to use it with the girls,\" she said.",
      "But Knowles admits there were problems along the way. She said the label didn't like the way she styled Destiny's Child.",
      "\"They dressed like an R&B group. We love the big glamour. And their hair was too big 'cause we came from Texas,\" she said. \"They just thought that it was too much for those young girls and that they should be in jeans and t-shirts like all the pop icons at the time. In the meantime, everywhere we went, people were saying,' Where can we get these outfits?'\"",
      "Knowles said the criticism from the label hurt her feelings, but it was a moment she remembers her husband, Mathew, pushing back.",

      "While their marriage struggled, Knowles said they were always present parents, but subject to scrutiny. She recalled the criticism people would say after Solange became pregnant as a teenager.",
      "\"Crazy stuff like, 'well you wasn't paying no attention. You're so busy running behind B that you couldn't see' \u2014 blah, blah, blah. I'm like, 'that is absolutely not true.'\"",

      "Four years after her divorce from Mathew Knowles, Tina Knowles married actor Richard Lawson. They were together for 10 years. She said she feels grateful for the relationship, even though it ultimately ended.",
      "\"I've known Richard for 40-something years and I think he's a great person,\" she said. \"So I don't have any regrets about the time that we spent together. I did feel a lot of pressure about ending the marriage because I had so many people to come up to me and tell me about that hope, but \u2013 it's not a tragedy.\"",

      "During an appearance on \"CBS Mornings,\" Winfrey praised the memoir for its intimate yet universal appeal.",
      "\"What you did is what I think is so hard to do when you're writing a memoir, and that is to tell your story intimately, personally, but also make it universal,\" Winfrey told Knowles. \"I believe everybody who has a mother, and everybody who is a mother is going to love this story.\"",

      "\"The best, important job\"",

      "\"There was a time that I separated, and they were devastated because they were very young, and they never knew why,\" Knowles explained. \"It's a difficult thing until they're older, because you don't want to put that on a kid.\"",

      "\"She knew early on that the girls' relationship with each other needed to be balanced and talked about in a way that she didn't feel capable of doing completely herself,\" Winfrey said.",
      "The book also reveals personal details about Knowles' childhood, including experiences with racism and the fact that her maiden name was Beyonc\u00e9, which later became her famous daughter's first name.",
      "Knowles also shares how she named the group Destiny's Child.",
      "\"I put their picture in my NIV study Bible, and one day I opened it, and it said 'Destiny.' And I was like, that's the name. And my ex-husband added 'child' to it because it was already a group by that name.\"",
      "When reflecting on motherhood, Knowles called it the \"best, important job of your life,\" explaining that despite her rebellious youth, \"With my kids, I said I got to control myself. I have to be deliberate and intentional ... I just didn't want to screw that up, because I screw some stuff up.\"",
      "\"Matriarch\" is available now, and Knowles will be embarking on a book tour to promote it. You can hear more on \"The Oprah Podcast,\" available on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "In 2013, when the aging Pope Benedict XVI, the conservative leader of the Catholic Church, resigned, the choice of a successor was nothing short of an election on the future direction of the Vatican. From the instant the progressive Argentinian cleric Jorge Mario Bergoglio walked out on the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square, the papacy of Pope Francis (Dec. 17, 1936-April 21, 2025) signaled and end to \"business as usual.\" He began with his choice of taking the name of a saint who lived in poverty after hearing God call him to \"rebuild my church, for it is in ruins.\"",
      "And the new pope's pronouncements demonstrated a willingness to look beyond accepted Catholic orthodoxy. He frankly discussed topics that were controversial within the Church, including gay priests and the role of women\u00a0in leadership. He also offered a more welcoming tone to the LGBTQ community, saying, \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\"",
      "He spoke out to address the danger of climate change, criticized the global financial system, and favored the opening of borders not just for refugees from conflict but also for economic migrants.",
      "His charisma and humility earned him the label \"the People's Pope,\" while his willingness to take as inspiration the life of the humble founder of the Franciscan order rejuvenated some Catholics, and attracted non-Catholics to the pope's mission. New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan described the \"Francis effect\" to \"Sunday Morning\" in 2017: \"The number of people that will come up to me as I'm walking the streets of New York and say, 'Hey, we like this guy, Francis. I haven't been to church in a while, but I'm taking a second look, okay?'\"",
      "The 266th pope was the first from the Americas. Born in Buenos Aires, the son of an accountant from Italy and the daughter of Italian immigrants, Bergoglio was ordained a priest with the Jesuit order, which he led during the country's violent dictatorship. He was named auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992, and in 1998 became archbishop. Three years later, he was elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II.",
      "His writings focused on social justice issues that would become among his chief concerns as pope: the poor, Indigenous peoples, the environment, and the need for a missionary church.",
      "His first trip outside Rome as pope was to the island of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean, where he met with newly-arrived migrants. There, he denounced the \"globalization of indifference\" shown to refugees, many of whom had drowned while seeking a better life. In his homily during an open Mass there, Francis said, \"Who has wept for the deaths of these brothers and sisters? Who has wept for the people who were on the boat? For the young mothers carrying their babies? For these men who wanted something to support their families? We are a society that has forgotten the experience of weeping, of 'suffering with'; the globalization of indifference has taken from us the ability to weep! \u2026 Let us ask the Lord for the grace to weep over our indifference, to weep over the cruelty in the world, in ourselves, and even in those who anonymously make socio-economic decisions that open the way to tragedies like this.\"",
      "And despite his overall popularity, Francis did have his critics who believe he had blurred the lines around traditional Church teachings. For example, while stating that marriage was between a man and a woman, he also said that priests could bless same-sex couples.",
      "\"You bet there are some conservatives that are unhappy with Pope Francis,\" Cardinal Dolan told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"There're also some liberals that wish he would move much more radically and expeditiously in some of the reforms. So, you're gonna get it from both sides.\"",
      "In 2017, when \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Mo Rocca asked the pope why he chose the name Francis, the pontiff replied, \"It just came to me.\"",
      "He then left with a request of his audience: \"Pray for me; I need it.\""

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now working with California on a project that is offering gift cards to encourage people to get tested or vaccinated near farms with bird flu, the state says.",
      "Some clinics in the state are giving $25 in gift cards to people in the community to get swabbed for a potential bird flu infection or to get a shot of the regular seasonal influenza vaccine.",
      "California is providing the gift cards at the clinics, which are run by the state's vendor. The CDC also has a testing van from the agency's Avian Flu Influenza Area Surveillance Testing, or AFAST project, offering testing at some of the sites.",
      "\"Funding for the gift cards comes out of California's bird flu state emergency declaration funds. CDC does testing only and offers no incentives of any kind,\" a spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health said in an email.",
      "The effort runs contrary to rumors on social media that states have stopped testing symptomatic farmworkers for bird flu, at the behest of the CDC under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "\"There has been no change to our guidance for testing suspect cases, we are not aware of any symptomatic workers not being referred or tested for H5N1, and it is very unlikely that testing would be declined if H5N1 was suspected,\" the California spokesperson said.",
      "A CDC spokesperson also said their guidance had not changed. The agency continues to recommend people with symptoms seek testing from their doctor or local health department.",
      "Authorities in neighboring Nevada told CBS News they are also continuing to offer testing and treatment to farm workers exposed to bird flu infections in their animals. In Idaho, another state that had seen bird flu infections in farms, authorities said they had not heard of symptomatic workers being discouraged from getting tested.",
      "\"We have no knowledge of this happening and have not heard any recent reports of symptomatic workers,\" AJ McWhorter, a spokesperson for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, said in an email.",
      "Labs run by state and local health departments are usually the first to conduct initial testing for bird flu, before forwarding the samples on to the CDC for confirmation. Health departments typically announce those \"presumptive\" detections, even if they turn out later not to be confirmed.",
      "In addition to testing people exposed to the virus on farms, California said it is also continuing to check whether other flu cases elsewhere in the state are being caused by bird flu.",
      "\"To date, all samples tested have been confirmed as seasonal subtypes H1 or H3, which rules out infection with H5N1 [bird flu]. The fact that no other human cases of H5N1 have been identified via subtyping efforts is reassuring,\" the California spokesperson said.",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:11:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Affordable Care Act requires health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive-care services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force at no cost to patients.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday considered a case that could impact whether Americans have to pay out-of-pocket for preventive-care services such as diabetes screenings, HIV-prevention drugs and statins, which are currently provided to patients at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The legal battle is the latest to land before the high court that involves the landmark health care overhaul signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in 2010. But this dispute turns on how to classify the 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which sits within the Department of Health and Human Services and has been making recommendations on preventive medical services to avoid serious health conditions since 1984.",
      "But last year, a federal appeals court in New Orleans found that the task force's structure violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because its members are principal officers who were not properly appointed. Principal officers must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "If the Supreme Court affirms the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, major hospital associations and leading nonprofits advocating on behalf of breast cancer and HIV patients have warned it would limit access to life-saving medical care for millions of patients, as insurers would no longer be required to cover at no cost to patients the services recommended by the task force.",
      "\"Patients who relied on the promise of preventive care without out-of-pocket costs for a variety of lifesaving interventions and screenings may now need to bear those costs themselves,\" a coalition of trade groups, led by the American Hospital Association, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief file with the Supreme Court. \"Realistically, this means that patients will not seek out essential preventive care or adhere to preventive medications after they are prescribed.\"",
      "While the Preventive Services Task Force has for more than three decades been making recommendations on preventive medical services, its role was codified by Congress in 1999. The task force's volunteer members are selected by the health and human services secretary and appointed to a four-year term. There are no restrictions on a member's removal, though Congress has said that all members and its recommendations \"shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "With passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congress required health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "Congress did not create a list of covered preventive services when it passed the ACA, but instead provided for categories of services that must be covered based on the recommendations of medical experts, including the task force. The Biden and Trump administrations have both estimated that millions of Americans have received these services for free through their insurance plans.",
      "Among the preventive services currently recommended by the task force are screenings for lung, cervical and colorectal cancers, as well as diabetes; statin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke; and medication to prevent HIV, known as PrEP, which gave rise to the legal battle currently before the Supreme Court.",
      "During arguments on Monday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested the language of the statute that established the task force is different from others involving the structure of independent agencies, which specify its officers are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and limit a president's ability to remove members to certain grounds.",
      "\"All of that's missing here,\" he said.",
      "Kavanaugh told Jonathan Mitchell, who argued that the task force's members are unlawfully appointed, that his argument hinges on the Supreme Court treating the task force as a \"massively important\" agency that makes \"critical decisions\" that affect a key segment of the economy, without any supervision or direction by the secretary.",
      "\"Normally, before that kind of thing would happen, Congress would've provided stronger indications that this task force is enormously important,\" he said, adding that he doesn't see any indicators that the entity is \"more powerful than the secretary of Health and Human Services or the president in terms of how these recommendations are going to affect the health care industry.\"",
      "Justice Elena Kagan also questioned why the secretary's power to remove task force members at will is not enough to show that they are accountable to the leader of the Department Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, which would undercut Mitchell's characterization of the members as principal officers who must be appointed by the president and Senate-confirmed.",
      "\"If you read this court's decisions, it seems often to be the end-all and the be-all that the court has suggested on many occasions that removal power is really the essence of control: If you have it, you have control. If you don't have it, you don't have control,\" she said.",
      "Kagan also said it would be \"odd\" for Congress to set up a task force, but not say who picks its members.",
      "Other justices questioned the scope of the word \"independent,\" and whether that puts the task force outside of the secretary's supervision.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor likened the task force, which gives technical advice, to her law clerks, who may offer independent judgments but are hired to \"help the decision-makers come to a conclusion.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court finds that the task force members are inferior officers, one possible outcome that was raised during the arguments was sending the case back to the 5th Circuit for more proceedings to decide whether Congress gave the Health and Human Services secretary the authority to appoint them.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch first raised that option and noted that the lower court didn't address whether the secretary has that power.",
      "While inferior officers must be appointed by the president and Senate, Congress can choose to vest this appointment power elsewhere, to an agency leader, for instance.",
      "The dispute before the high court arose after the task force recommended in June 2019 that PrEP be included among the preventive services covered without cost-sharing arrangements. A group of four individuals and two small businesses filed a lawsuit targeting the Preventive Services Task Force, and objected to the ACA's requirement that insurers cover certain HIV-prevention drugs that are recommended by it on religious grounds.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that providing coverage of PrEP \"encourages and facilitates homosexual behavior,\" which conflicts with their religious beliefs, and said they want to purchase or provide plans that exclude coverage of that medication.",
      "Five of the six challengers do not participate in the health insurance market, and the sixth, Braidwood Management, provides coverage to 70 employees through a self-insured plan.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Texas, argued that the task force's structure violates the Constitution's Appointments Clause because its members are principal officers who therefore must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The district court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that the task force members were improperly appointed. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor also invalidated all preventive-care coverage recommendations that had been implemented since the ACA was signed into law in March 2010, and barred the government from enforcing the health care law's coverage requirements in response to the task force's recommendations going forward.",
      "The 5th Circuit affirmed the lower court's finding that the task force's structure is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the universal relief it provided as to the task force's prior requirements for preventive-care coverage.",
      "In concluding that the task force's members are principal officers, the 5th Circuit said they were not properly appointed because they wield \"unreviewable power\" \u2014 issuing preventive-care recommendations for services that insurers, in turn, must cover under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court and the Trump administration has continued to defend the board's structure.",
      "Hashim Mooppan, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices that the task force members are inferior officers because they are \"subject to ample supervision\" by the Health and Human Services secretary when issuing recommendations on preventive care services that must be covered by insurers and group health plans.",
      "Additionally, the task force members can be removed by the head of the Health and Human Services Department at-will, and the secretary can review its recommendations and prevent them from taking effect, Mooppan said.",
      "Given these \"collective powers of supervision,\" the task force can't issue recommendations that bind the insurance industry unless the secretary permits it to do so, he said.",
      "In court filings, the Trump administration also noted that even if the task force members were principal officers who had to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, the constitutional violation would be remedied by severing a provision of federal law that the 5th Circuit found insulates it from the Health and Human Services secretary's supervision.",
      "Doing that would allow the task force to \"make recommendations that will have legal effect only under appropriate supervision by the secretary,\" then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in a February brief.",
      "But lawyers for Braidwood Management have said that the task force members are principal officers who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate in part because federal law dictates that their recommendations be kept \"independent\" and \"not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "\"Congress has chosen to create an independent task force and shield it from political pressure,\" Mitchell, who argued on behalf of Braidwood Management, told the justices.",
      "He said that it's \"not clear\" Congress would even have approved a regime under which the secretary \u2014 a political appointee \u2014 rather than an independent task force decides the preventive care that insurers have to cover.",
      "Even if the Supreme Court finds that the members are inferior officers, as the Trump administration argues, Mitchell said that category of executive branch officials still requires appointment by the president and Senate, unless Congress says otherwise.",
      "He also disputed that the court can fix these constitutional violations by separating out the problematic provision of the law and empowering the secretary to veto the task force's recommendations for mandated preventive-care coverage. The task force, Mitchell said, would still have unreviewable discretion when it decides not to require coverage of a particular service.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, outside medical organizations have warned that a decision invalidating the structure of the task force would have significant ramifications for access to preventive care.",
      "The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation said that the elimination of cost-sharing for breast cancer preventive-care measures has had a \"profound impact\" on public health because screenings lead to earlier detection and treatment, and fewer deaths.",
      "\"The costs of such preventive care \u2014 if not fully covered by insurance, which is the effect of the district court's decision \u2014 dissuade individuals from utilizing the services, and thus lead to later detection, later-stage diagnoses, more aggressive treatment plans, higher treatment costs, and more deaths,\" the organization said in a brief.",
      "The HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute said the task force's recommendations have been \"essential\" to preventing HIV, hepatitis and other infectious diseases for millions of patients.",
      "\"Without continued access to the no-cost prevention assured under the ACA and consequent new transmissions, our nation will witness a reversal of decades of progress as HIV resurges,\" the group said in a brief, joined by 19 other organizations.",
      "But groups backing Braidwood have argued that the task force is insulated from political accountability, as the ACA left no room for supervision by the Health and Human Services secretary or any other principal officer who answers to the president.",

    "story": [
      "American consumers are starting to feel the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, especially online.",
      "Since the second week in April, sellers on Amazon have raised their prices on nearly 1,000 products, according to data from SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike \u2014 nearly 30%.",
      "Costs rose on a wide range of items, from tech accessories such as phone charges to women's clothing, SmartScout founder and CEO Scott Needham told CBS MoneyWatch. Anker, a top-selling brand on Amazon that sells mobile charging devices, has increased prices on roughly 25% of its products on the site, for example.",
      "\"It's one of first concerted efforts I've seen where nothing explains the price hikes other than tariffs,\" Needham said.",
      "Tariffs are paid by importers, and they typically pass on much or even all of those additional costs to consumers. Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy told CNBC\u00a0earlier this month that he expected U.S. tariffs to boost prices on a host of consumer goods.",
      "The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports, while China has retaliated with levies of 125% on U.S. goods entering the country. Mr. Trump has long accused China of unfair trade practices, saying that tariffs will reinvigorate the domestic manufacturing sector and spur economic growth.",
      "Shein, Temu prices also rising",
      "Other major e-commerce players and retailers have also lifted prices to offset higher import costs, sometime by adding \"tariff surcharges\" to customers' bills. Chinese e-commerce sites Shein and Temu each announced\u00a0last week that they would hike prices after the U.S. closed a loophole that had allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.",
      "Those price hikes took effect today. On Temu's site, a pair of running sneakers that last week cost $14 now runs about $27.",
      "The jump illustrates retailers' struggles to navigate President Trump's tariff agenda. Sky-high tariffs can make manufacturing goods in countries like China uneconomical. But revamping supply chains or moving manufacturing to another country can take years and cost hundreds of millions or even billions dollars, experts say.",
      "Uncertainty over tariff rates and how long such levies could remain in place is also making it difficult for companies to plan.",
      "Mr. Trump said this week that the U.S. and China were actively negotiating over how to resolve their trade differences and that he expected tariffs on Chinese imports to fall \"substantially.\" But officials in Beijing quickly\u00a0denied the sides were in talks, and instead reiterated its demand that the U.S. revoke its tariffs against the nation.",

    "summary": "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg says his tariff costs will surge more than 40-fold to $100 million, while sales could fall.",
    "story": [
      "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg thinks the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs will be catastrophic for both his family-owned toy business and for the broader U.S. economy. That's why he's suing President Trump.",
      "Woldenberg's business has 500 employees and sells thousands of learning-based toys like Spike the Fine Motor Hedgehog and the Pretend & Play Calculator Cash Register. Its lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., accuses Mr. Trump and other members of his administration of overreaching the president's authority in imposing the broad-based import duties. Congress has historically held the power to authorize new tariffs or make trade deals with other nations.",
      "With the administration's higher tariffs in place, the math is dire for Learning Resources, Woldenberg said. The company's import duties are set to increase from $2.3 million prior to the Trump administration to $100 million \u2014 a roughly 4,000% increase, he said.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic\"",
      "At the same time, Woldenberg said he expects his company's sales to drop 25% this year as consumers scale back spending due to the economic impact of the tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's trade war, the CEO had forecast an 8% increase in sales. Economists on Wall Street\u00a0say the tariffs\u00a0will slow U.S. economic growth while boosting inflation.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic,\" Woldenberg told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Forces have been unleashed in the economy \u2014 the world economy as well as the U.S. economy \u2014 that will have consequences that will be irreparable.\"",
      "Learning Resources' suit asks the court to find that Mr. Trump's tariffs are unlawful and to block the administration from collecting the levies. Based in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Learning Resources is a private, family-owned business founded in 1984.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the suit or the company's financial challenges caused by the tariffs.",
      "For now, Woldenberg said he's focused on figuring out how to shift manufacturing out of China, where about 60% of his products are produced. Goods imported from that nation are now facing U.S. tariffs of 145%.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by the companies that import the products, Woldenberg's business \u2014 not China \u2014 is on the hook for paying for Mr. Trump's high import duties.",
      "One question facing Woldenberg is whether he can shift production out of China fast enough to keep ahead of Mr. Trump's tariffs. In recent years, Learning Resources has added factories in India and Vietnam, but that effort has only moved the needle so far, he said.",
      "\"In a two- or three-year period we moved 16% of our product from China to those markets and got things going,\" Woldenberg said. \"That took a lot of effort, cost us a couple million dollars, at least, in out-of-pocket expenses to move it from Point A to Point B, and a huge amount of man hours on our side to essentially redevelop all those products.\"",
      "Despite that effort, however, the company has to date moved only about 16% of its manufacturing capacity out of China to other countries, Woldenberg said.",
      "Reshoring realities",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that tariffs will revive the domestic manufacturing sector because the costs of the import taxes will spur both American and foreign businesses to reshore their factories to the U.S. But economists \u2014 and Woldenberg \u2014 are skeptical, pointing out that such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories.",
      "\"The fact that [Mr. Trump] believes in it is something that I think is irrelevant \u2014 there are people that believe in ghosts, OK?\" Woldenberg said.",
      "Learning Resources' financial resources aren't deep enough to build its own factory, Woldenberg said. He noted that he's also tried to find plants in the U.S. that could make some of his products because he believed toys with a \"Made in USA\" label could appeal to some customers.",
      "\"If we had six to 10 products that were made in America, we could go and say, 'Look! Made in America. You want made in America? Here's Made in America,\" he said. \"We can't even find somebody to make six or 10 products.\"",
      "The reason, he said, is U.S. manufacturers don't have the capability to make the types of products he's selling, while the costs of manufacturing them himself would be prohibitive. \"I cannot produce a factory that can produce our product at a competitive price,\" Woldenberg said.",
      "To be sure, some businesses have announced plans to build new U.S. plants or hire more workers in recent months. They include tech giant Apple, which in February\u00a0said\u00a0that it's committed to spending more than $500 billion on expanding its U.S. manufacturing capabilities over four years.",
      "But Apple \"is in a different stratosphere than me,\" Woldenberg noted. \"They also have like a dozen products. We have 2,000.\"",
      "Skittish workers",
      "Meantime, Woldenberg said he's committed to keeping his 500 workers employed, likening the current challenges to those his business faced during the pandemic. Now, as then, his employees are worried about the impact of Mr. Trump's trade war and whether their jobs might be at risk, he said.",
      "\"Two days before we were kicked out of our office in March of 2020, I had an all-company meeting and I said, 'We define this as a community problem ... the goal is to get everybody across the river.' And we did that,\" he said. \"No one lost an hour of pay.\"",
      "Woldenberg added, \"I have a very strong commitment to getting them through this, and it's unwavering, and I'll do everything that I can.\"",
      "Even so, Woldenberg wants to see the Trump administration drop their tariff plans.",

      "Avelo Airlines is targeting a new passenger segment: migrants being sent to detention centers across the U.S. The budget carrier will also use its planes to fly migrants out of the country under the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.",
      "Avelo has signed a contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to handle deportation flights for U.S. Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE), the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Avelo, which launched in 2021, said the move is necessary for the Houston-based airline to remain financially stable.",
      "\"We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy said in a statement to CBS News earlier this month after the company struck a deal with ICE. \"After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.\"",
      "The domestic and international flights ferrying migrants will begin May 14 out of a new hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where Avelo will station three Boeing 737-800 planes to handle the transports. Unlike the company's regular commercial flights, the aircraft used for the trips will not bear Avelo's logo, the company said.",
      "Avelo described the agreement with ICE as a \"long-term charter program.\" The exact terms of the deal were not made public.",
      "The airline is now recruiting flight attendants to staff the flights, according to a\u00a0job posting\u00a0for what it calls a \"charter program for the Department of Homeland Security.\" The job pays $28 an hour for the first year of service.",
      "\"We are seeking energetic, highly motivated Flight Attendants who wish to join a committed group of safety and service professionals at Avelo Airlines,\" the listing reads.",
      "\"Flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS's deportation efforts,\" the post adds, although it makes no references to migrants.",
      "Avelo offers flights across the U.S. and to international destinations including the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico. It operates out of eight hubs across the U.S., flying out of the following airports: Concord-Padgett Regional Airport in North Carolina; Hollywood Burbank Airport in California; Lakeland International Airport in Florida; Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina; Sonoma County Airport in California; Tweed-New Haven airport in Connecticut; Wilmington Airport in New Hampshire; and Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina.",
      "The company previously operated charter flights as Casino Express Airlines before rebranding as Avelo in 2021, according to S&P Capital IQ.",
      "Avelo declined to comment further on its contract with the government. DHS confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch that Avelo is contracting with ICE to assist with deportation flights.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has long contracted with CSI Aviation, an aviation broker that provides private air charter services, medical flights for patients in emergencies and government flight services. Under its new contract with ICE, Avelo will operate as a sub-carrier of CSI.",
      "DHS also subcontracts with other air charter companies, which provide planes and operate the flights. One such charter outfit is GlobalX. It handles roughly 70% of DHS' flights, according to immigrant advocate Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an activist group monitoring ICE operations.",
      "GlobalX did not reply to a request for comment on its work with DHS.",
      "Cartwright, who tracks ICE flights through publicly available sources, expressed surprise at Avelo agreeing to shuttle migrants destined for detention centers or deportation.",
      "\"I have never seen a retail airline that sells to consumers being used in this way,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Typically, charter companies that don't fly retail-type flights. They are not selling tickets directly to consumers.\"",
      "According to data on USAspending.gov, a U.S. government website that tracks federal spending, DHS' roughly 6-month contract this year with CSI Aviation is worth at least $78.1 million. Its value could rise to as much as $162.2 million.",
      "The purpose of the agreement, the site states, \"is to provide daily scheduled large aircraft & special high risk charter flights to facilitate ICE's enforcement and removal of operations of illegal aliens.\"",
      "CSI Aviation did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on its contract with the federal government.",
      "Cruising for revenue",
      "Airline industry experts said charter outfits like CSI typically aren't familiar to the general public.",
      "\"Nobody has usually ever heard of the airlines,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals site, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are charter airlines that don't have a set schedule on a website,\" he said.",
      "However, an upstart airline hunting for additional revenue streams outside of selling tickets to members of the flying public is not unusual.",
      "\"It's very difficult to compete with the Deltas and Uniteds of the world, so they try any number of tactics,\" Keyes explained. \"They fly to and from smaller cities, they offer bargain-basement prices. There are all different types of counter-positioning things they do.\"",
      "But Avelo's move is more surprising because most commercial airlines don't have enough spare aircraft and crew for specialized operations like migrant flights, noted Seth Miller, founder and editor in chief of PaxEx Aero, an aviation consulting service. Miller said he opposes Avelo working with U.S. immigration authorities on ethical grounds.",
      "Avelo's contract with DHS is also drawing criticism from an immigrant advocacy group. A petition started by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition urging people to boycott Avelo until it severs ties with ICE has collected more than 34,650 signatures.",
      "\"We reject the Trump Administration's inhumane deportation practices, reject cooperation from the State of Connecticut in support of Avelo as long as they are complicit in these practices and pledge to boycott Avelo as long as they are profiting from ICE flights,\" the petition states.",
      "Although federal contracts can provide steady business for airlines and charter carriers, Avelo's partnership with DHS poses a reputational risk, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I still think it's morally questionable to run these charters for the federal government and think it poses a very real reputational risk for Avelo,\" Miller said, citing protests against the airline at some of Avelo's hubs.",
      "Will Humphries, a traveler at Sonoma County Airport, in Santa Rosa, California, where Avelo operates, is among those members of the flying public who plan to boycott Avelo because of its work with ICE.",
      "\"There's not much I can do as an individual, so the limited choices I can make, like switching an airline, is definitely within my ability,\" he told CBS News Bay Area.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 15:18:18 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said that a baby bonus provided to new parents could be a \"good idea.\" Here's how it's worked in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are having fewer babies, with the annual birth rate now standing near a record low. It's a trend that has implications for the nation's long-term outlook \u2014 and has drawn attention from the Trump administration, with the New York Times reporting that a proposal for a $5,000 \"baby bonus\" may be one option for juicing the birth rate.",
      "\"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" President Trump said on Tuesday at a White House event when asked about the possibility of a federal baby bonus.",
      "Yet the idea may be far from becoming a reality, with a White House official telling CBS MoneyWatch that no final decision on such a plan has been made.",
      "A declining birth rate can spell long-term economic problems, including a shrinking labor force that's financially strapped to pay for medical services and retirement benefits for an aging population. But reversing a nation's declining birth rate could take far more than a one-time payment that, for most parents, would be quickly consumed by the costs of diapers, child care and other essentials.",
      "Other countries with similar demographic trends have tried an array of strategies to revive their birth rates, but in most cases with short-lived results or no impact at all.",
      "Some experts point out that by tackling long-standing economic issues \u2014 such as providing affordable day care and paid parental leave after the birth of a child \u2014 the government could provide a more hospitable environment for families. The U.S. is one of a only a handful of nations that doesn't provide paid leave for parents, including countries such as Papua New Guinea and Suriname.",
      "\"President Trump is proudly implementing policies to uplift American families, from securing order [at the] border to keep violent criminals out of our communities, to lowering taxes and the cost of living,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in an email in response to a question about the baby bonus idea. \"The President wants America to be a country where all children can safely grow up and achieve the American dream.\"",
      "Here's what to know about baby bonuses.",
      "How much has the U.S. birth rate declined?",
      "About 3.6 million babies were born in the U.S. last year, according to the most recent CDC data. That's little changed from the prior year, when the number of births hit a new record low.",
      "The fertility rate, or the average number of children born to each woman in the U.S., dropped to about 1.6 in 2023, down from 3.7 in 1960, when the nation was in the midst of the post-war baby boom, according to data from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "What's causing the decline?",
      "That's unclear from an economic or policy standpoint, according to economists Melissa Kearney of University of Maryland, Philip Levine of Wellesley College and Luke Pardue of the Aspen Economic Strategy Group, the authors of a 2022\u00a0analysis of the birth rate decline in the economics publication Econofact.",
      "But, they added, \"Shifting priorities could be the primary driver for the decline in the birth rate since 2007.\"",
      "Survey and anecdotal data suggests that \"young adults have different preferences for having children, aspirations for life and views about parenting norms that are driving the decline in the U.S. birth rates,\" they wrote.",
      "Could financial incentives increase the birth rate?",
      "Other countries that have tried similar monetary incentives have had mixed success.",
      "Australia introduced a baby bonus in 2004, providing $3,000 Australian dollars to parents for each birth, an amount that was eventually hiked to A$5,000.",
      "After an initial bump in births when the policy was introduced, Australia's birth rate has continued to decline, dropping from about 2 children on average for each woman to about 1.5 in 2023, below the U.S. rate, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.",
      "Likewise, Hungary has introduced a number of incentives to convince its citizens to have more children, from providing baby grants to tax breaks for families with three or more children. Its birth rate increased slightly in the 2010s after hitting a record low of about 1.2 in 2011.",
      "But after rising to 1.6 in 2021, Hungary's birth rate is once again dropping, demographic data shows.",
      "\"Baby bonuses have not worked for Hungary. Why would we replicate this here in [the U.S.]?\" wrote Gabriella Hoffman, the director of the Center for Energy and Conservation at Independent Women's Forum, in a social media post.",
      "How much does it cost to raise a child?",
      "Raising a child in the U.S. doesn't come cheap, with one recent analysis finding parents will spend about $300,000 to raise a child to age 18.",
      "How would a U.S. baby bonus work?",
      "Typically such incentives are paid either through a tax credit or a government check, similar to the stimulus checks that were given to millions of households during the pandemic.",
      "Already, the U.S. has a Child Tax Credit of about $2,000 per child, but that is claimed on a parent's annual tax return, which means families must wait until tax season to collect the benefit.",
      "\"Unlike the Child Tax Credit, a baby bonus could come right after a child is born \u2014 there would be no wait until next year's tax season to get the money that parents need for a crib and a car seat today,\" wrote senior policy analyst Leah Sargeant in a recent post at the Niskanen Center, a political think tank. \"It can be more generously structured than the CTC because it is a supplement for a single, critical year, not an ongoing payment.\"",
      "How much would a $5,000 baby bonus cost the U.S.?",
      "If the parent of every child born in the U.S. annually qualified for a $5,000 bonus, the cost could mount to more than $15 billion a year.",
      "That could be tough to pass at a time when Republican lawmakers are seeking to reduce federal spending in order to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's tax cuts, which is currently part of a bill advancing in Congress.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. stocks whipsawed on Friday, signaling an end to a three-day rally that was driven by investor hopes of a de-escalation in the trade war.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 76 points, or 0.2%, to 40,017 in early afternoon trading, while the S&P 500 inched higher 24 points, or 0.4%, to 5,509. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9%, thanks to boost from a handful of Big Tech stocks.",
      "Mr. Trump had adopted a softer tune on trade in recent days, allaying investors' concerns and helping trigger a three-day relief rally following a volatile trading day on Monday. Paul Ashworth, a chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research note that negative activity in the market played a \"key role\" in the president's decision reconsider his steep tariffs on imported Chinese goods, which currently total 145%.",
      "Meanwhile, the markets are also reacting to mixed signals from the White House about potential trade deals.",
      "Mr. Trump this week hinted at a possible trade deal with China, but the Chinese government has denied the two countries are in\u00a0active negotiations.\u00a0CNN did report, however, that China was rolling back the 125% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. semiconductors, a sign it could be relaxing its stance.",
      "\"We're in a headline driven market, and we're prone to volatility spikes and outsized trading ranges in both directions,\" said Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment analyst at eToro. \"And you know, it's probably going to remain that type of market until we at least have more clarity on what's going on.\"",
      "In a Time interview released Friday morning, Mr. Trump suggested his administration has struck 200 trade deals with countries, and that those would be announced in the next three to four weeks.",
      "CEOs: \"Elevated uncertainty\"",
      "On Thursday and Friday, several companies cautioned that uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's trade war is making it difficult to give financial forecasts for the upcoming year.",
      "Intel weighed on the market after the chip company said it's seeing \"elevated uncertainty across the industry\" and gave a forecast for upcoming revenue and profit that fell short of analysts' expectations. Its stock fell 6.8% even though its results for the beginning of the year topped expectations.",
      "Eastman Chemical fell 5.9% after it gave a forecast for profit this spring that fell short of analysts' expectations. CEO Mark Costa said that the \"macroeconomic uncertainty that defined the last several years has only increased\" and that future demand for its products \"is unclear given the magnitude and scope of tariffs.\"",
      "Skechers U.S.A., the shoe and apparel company, pulled its financial forecasts for the year due to \"macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies\" even though it just reported a record quarter of revenue at $2.41 billion. Its stock fell 4.3%.",
      "Trade deals",
      "Over the last few weeks, the president and members of his administration have been meeting with different countries to discuss bi-lateral trade deals. This comes after Mr. Trump paused the implementation of so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days \u2014 providing a sigh of relief to markets and consumers alike. This pause, UBS analysts said, demonstrates that the president is aware of how tariffs might be negatively impacting market activity.",
      "\"So, while we expect equity markets to remain choppy, the risk-reward for stocks is looking more appealing, especially now that we know that Trump is attuned to the risks from his tariff policies,\" said David Lefkowitz, head of US equities at UBS Global Wealth Management in a research note.",
      "Lefkowitz said that the tariff-induced slowdown will hinder corporate profit growth, but that projected the economy would rebound next year as businesses and consumers acclimate to tariffs and the Fed introduces rate cuts.",
      "Tariffs on China could be slashed to as low as 50 to 65%, the Wall Street Journal this week\u00a0reported. But even if tariffs do come down as a result of trade negotiations, that doesn't mean the U.S. economy is out of the woods yet. The remaining levies could still stifle economic growth, analysts say.",
      "\"The April 2 rose garden start on tariffs might have been the high water mark, but you're still talking about a significant burden that is being imposed on companies and the economy from tariffs,\" said Adam Crisafulli, an analyst at Vital Knowledge. \"And that's not going away.\"",
      "While the U.S. stock market lost some steam on Friday, an ease in 10-year Treasury yields and a rebound in U.S. dollar index provided welcome signs of relief. The 10-year Treasury fell to 4.28% from 4.32% late Thursday, while value of the U.S. dollar ticked up to throughout the week, strengthening its value against the euro and other rival currencies.",

      "The Trump administration said it will accelerate permit approvals for mining, drilling and fossil fuel production and transportation on public land, fast-tracking a review process that would normally take years.",
      "In announcing the emergency procedures Wednesday, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the management of federal lands and natural resources, said the permitting process will now take up to \"28 days at most\" \u2014 a drastic departure from the current one- to two-year timeline.",
      "The government agency said the move is in response to President Trump's January 20 declaration of a national energy emergency. In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail. The new guidelines will apply to a wide range of energy projects, including crude oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The U.S. leads the world in\u00a0oil\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0production, with an output of 20 million barrels of oil a day and accounting for roughly a quarter of global gas production, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "The DOI said it would use emergency authorities under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to expedite the permitting process.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to wait,\" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \"President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security, and these emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.\"",
      "Lawsuits to come, experts say",
      "Environmental advocates rebuked the announcement, saying that in addition to adverse environmental impacts on public land and water sources, the expedited procedures will strip away community members' ability to weigh in on projects happening in their own backyards. Experts say the move is expected to draw legal challenges.",
      "\"What they're proposing to do is basically forgo environmental review or public participation or anything meaningful,\" said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. \"The implications of that are extreme.\"",
      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Section 7 of the Act requires consultation among agencies \"to ensure their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of federally protected species, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",
      "A win for oil and gas industries",
      "The announcement on Wednesday was a win for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, which has\u00a0cheered\u00a0Mr. Trump's energy agenda.",
      "\"Our nation's permitting system is broken, and reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy,\" Holly Hopkins, VP of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Former officials from several different federal agencies who served under Mr. Trump's previous term and the Biden administration have told CBS News on background that looming workforce reductions could throw a wrench in the department's plans to speed up the permitting process. Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon. An internal White House document obtained by The Washington Post indicated that as many as 1 in 4 department employees could be let go as a part of a broader series of staff cuts across government agencies.",
      "\"How can you accomplish so much with fewer and fewer people?\" said Burger of Columbia's Sabin Center. \"The only result is less and less oversight.\"",
      "Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, agreed, adding that gutting the federal agency could hinder the Trump administration's objectives.",
      "\"They just don't seem to understand that these employees run the gamut from wildlife biologists to firefighters, to people who permit oil and gas drilling or permit mines on federal lands,\" he said. \"If it's going to wholesale cut staff, some of the things they care about are going to get caught up in that.\"",
      "The Department of Interior did not respond to request for comment on how layoffs might impact its ability to issue permits on a tighter timetable.",
      "According to the new procedural guidelines issued by the agency this week, companies seeking a permit are required to confirm in writing that they want their project covered by the expedited process \u2014 meaning that not everyone will necessarily opt in. Those that do could stand to lose big, Manuel said.",

Flight searches to Rome surged 250% in the three days following Pope Francis' death on Monday, compared with searches over the same period in 2024, according to travel booking site Expedia.com.",
      "Searches for lodging in Rome through the fare aggregator have also shot up 35% for the same dates, compared to the same period a year ago. While U.S. residents largely account for the burst in demand for travel to Rome, global searches from other countries are also up 125% for the week, according to Expedia.",
      "\"I can't think of any other event that has caused a sudden spike in travel searches like this,\" Expedia travel expert Melanie Fish told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And it's not only flight searches. It's accommodation searches, too, and it's clear why because of the travel dates.\"",
      "Scott Keyes, founder and CEO of flight deals website Going.com, said search interest in travel to Rome for April 21-23 has nearly tripled since the pope's death, compared with the three previous days.",
      "For tourists thinking of booking a jaunt to Italy, the bad news is that the surge in demand for fights to Rome is driving up airfares, according to Going.com. For flights from the U.S. to Rome departing between April 22-25 and returning April 27-30, airfares are up about 33% compared to flight prices in the days leading up to Pope Francis' death.",
      "Fish noted that ticket prices typically rise closest to the travel date, and Expedia is expecting prices for flights to Rome to rise as Friday approaches. That's in part because airlines can't immediately add more capacity despite increased demand, she noted. \"So what you'll likely see is crowded flights and prices spiking today and tomorrow.\"",

      "The chief executives of Walmart and Target privately warned President Trump this week that his sweeping tariff policy could disrupt supply chains and lead to empty shelves in the coming weeks, sources familiar with the White House meeting told CBS News.",
      "The CEO of Home Depot was also present at Monday's closed-door meeting. Axios was first to report on the retail executives' warnings to Mr. Trump.",
      "Target and Walmart declined to comment on the specific warnings.",
      "Following their meeting with Mr. Trump on Monday, both companies did issue statements.",
      "\"We had a productive meeting with President Trump and his team and appreciated the opportunity to share our insights,\" Walmart said in a statement.",
      "Target, in a similar statement, said \"we had a productive meeting with President Trump and our retail peers to discuss the path forward on trade, and we remain committed to delivering value for American consumers.\"",
      "The two retailers have publicly warned that Mr. Trump's tariffs could lead to higher prices. Weeks after Mr. Trump's election win, Walmart CFO John David Rainey told CNBC, \"We never want to raise prices,\" but \"there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers.\"",
      "And last month, Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC, \"the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days\" from tariffs planned on imports from Mexico, noting Target heavily relies on Mexican produce to stock its grocery shelves in the winter.",
      "The Trump administration has imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese goods and 10% tariffs on most other countries. Mr. Trump also announced steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of other U.S. trading partners earlier this month, but paused most of the non-China levies for 90 days.",
      "The import duties have rattled markets in recent weeks and prompted fears about rising consumer prices, slower economic growth and supply chain shortfalls. The Trump administration has considered forming a working group to handle any strains on supply chains caused by the China tariffs, CBS News reported last week.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood by his tariff strategy, casting it as a way to boost U.S. manufacturing and stymie what he views as unfair trade practices \u2014 but he has indicated he would like to negotiate new trade deals with other countries. The president told reporters Tuesday he expects the 145% China tariffs to \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero.\"",

    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc's digital competition rules. The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \"periodic penalty payments,\" the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It's a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do's and don'ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \"gatekeepers\" from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \"that citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\" Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",
      "\"The decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,\" Virkkunen said.",
      "Both companies indicated they would appeal.",
      "\"The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,\" Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement provided by the U.S. tech giant. \"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\"",
      "Apple accused the commission of \"unfairly targeting\" the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\" despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA's provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \"non-compliant\" conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \"spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\"Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "Apple has also faced a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., where the\u00a0Justice Department alleged\u00a0that the California company illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a \"moat around its smartphone monopoly\" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.",
      "The EU's Meta investigation centered on the company's strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union's top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta's model, saying it doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \"freely consent\" to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also include Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \"currently assessing\" this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",
      "The European Commission has also\u00a0slapped Google with antitrust penalties several times, including a record $5 billion fine levied in 2018 over the search engine's abuse of the market dominance of its Android mobile phone operating system.",

    "story": [
      "Since the start of President Trump's second term in office, a number of corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S.",
      "The announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs\u00a0take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.",
      "In March, for example, the White House\u00a0celebrated\u00a0pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson's plan to invest $55 billion in U.S. manufacturing, calling it a \"massive victory in President Donald J. Trump's\u00a0unrelenting pursuit\u00a0of American manufacturing dominance\" in a statement on its website.",
      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"",

      "The Food and Drug Administration is asking the food industry to stop using synthetic food dyes, in a bid to fulfill one of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goals to swap them out with natural alternatives in the U.S. food supply.",
      "The FDA's move stops short of the outright ban that had been floated for in Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform from the campaign trail. Instead, it relies on what the Department of Health and Human Services said was a \"national standard and timeline for the industry\" to voluntarily make the switch.",
      "\"Let's start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes. But we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly,\" FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told reporters at an event to announce the plan.",
      "Makary said he had had \"wonderful meetings with the food industry\" and claimed that they are eager to remove artificial dyes from the food supply.",
      "\"They want to do it. So why go down a complicated road with Congress when they want to do this,\" Makary said.",
      "HHS says the FDA will be \"working with industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic food dyes\" and will also be accelerating the review and approval of some new natural color additives.",
      "Response from the food industry",
      "The food dye industry denied that there was a safety concern with artificial dyes, citing past reviews by the FDA and other international authorities, and said that their use is \"essential for consistency, visual appeal, and consumer trust in food products.\"",
      "\"Requiring reformulation by the end of 2026 ignores scientific evidence and underestimates the complexity of food production. The process is neither simple nor immediate, and the resulting supply disruptions will limit access to familiar, affordable grocery items,\" the International Association of Color Manufacturers said in a statement after the announcement.",
      "The group representing milk, cheese and yogurt manufacturers, the International Dairy Foods Association, announced a \"voluntary\" pledge for some of its members stop adding artificial colors to products supplied to school lunches.",
      "The National Confectioners Association, which represents candy brands, was noncommittal in\u00a0their response, saying that they \"look forward to working with the Trump Administration and Congress on this issue.\"",
      "A\u00a0statement from the Consumer Brands Association, which represents industry giants from Coca-Cola to WK Kellogg, also stopped short of pledging to remove all synthetic dyes by 2026, but said they \"appreciate that the administration has reasserted their leadership\" in response to a patchwork of state laws.",
      "\"Removing these safe ingredients does not change the consumer packaged goods industry's commitment to providing safe, affordable and convenient product choices to consumers,\" the association said.",
      "Why Makary opposes synthetic dyes",
      "Ending the use of artificial dyes has long been a goal of Kennedy's agenda, over concerns that these colors are inflating the consumption of unhealthy foods and raising the risk of potentially worrying behavioral changes in children, among other risks.",
      "\"Why are we taking a gamble? Parents, moms and dads have also tried to raise attention to this issue. Some parents have observed that these chemicals cause hyperactivity and even aggressive behavior, and that it subsides when the chemicals are removed from the diet,\" said Makary.",
      "Makary said that the scientific community \"has conducted a number of studies raising concerns about the correlation\" between synthetic dyes derived from petroleum and health conditions like ADHD, obesity, stomach or digestive issues and allergies.",
      "\"Other studies have found that artificial colors that create vibrant colors mess with the child's developing brain to make ultra-processed foods more attractive, even when the child already feels full,\" said Makary.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the FDA moved to revoke the authorization for one synthetic dye, Red 3, after studies suggested that the color additive could cause cancer in laboratory animals at high doses.",
      "The food and drug industry has a few years to stop using the food dye completely. Makary said they are asking companies to stop using the dye sooner than the deadlines laid out by the agency under the law, which are as late as 2028 for drugmakers.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 06:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Allianz survey finds that nearly two-thirds of Americans are more worried about running out of money in retirement than they are about dying.",
    "story": [
      "Faced with inflation, taxes and concerns over the size of Social Security benefits, most Americans are more afraid of going broke in retirement than they are of death.",
      "That's according to a new study from Allianz Life that surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults aged 25 years and older with annual incomes of $50,000 and above. In total, 64% of respondents across generations said they are more stressed about running out of funds in their golden years than the prospect of death.",
      "\"It's much higher right now than it has been for quite a while,\" said Kelly LaVigne, VP of consumer insights at Allianz Life. The company has been polling people on the question of whether dying or running out of money worries them more since 2022.",
      "Americans say they need $1.26 million to finance a comfortable retirement, according to a\u00a0recent study by Northwestern Mutual. That's $200,000 lower than last year's estimate, but still a far cry from the median amount of $87,000 people have saved in their retirement accounts, according to Federal Reserve Board's\u00a0Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "Among the different age groups, Gen Xers, for whom retirement is fast approaching, are the most concerned about running out of money before they die. Seventy percent of the age group expressed concern, followed by 61% of boomers. Ages 61 to 79, boomers are already in their retirement era, while Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, will be the next generation to retire.",
      "\"Certainly for boomers who are already in retirement, inflation is a big deal because you only have a certain amount of money that you're going to have for the rest of your life,\" said LaVigne.",
      "Tough time to save money",
      "Though Inflation rates have eased since peaking in June 2022, the cost of basic living expenses\u00a0is still rising, making it difficult for Americans to sock away extra savings. Over 50% of those surveyed by Allianz said high inflation contributed to their fear of running out of money in retirement.",
      "Other factors contributing to Americans' fears include high taxes and concern over whether monthly Social Security payments will provide them with enough financial support. For the average American, Social Security benefits typically replaces about 40% of their income, LaVigne said.",
      "Recent shake-ups at the Social Security Administration carried out by the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also stoked fears about the stability of the government agency.",
      "LaVigne's advice for distressed savers: Don't let fear stop you from seeking help. \"You really want to make sure that you're working with a professional to help you get through the times like this, where there's a lot of uncertainty,\" he said.",

      "More than 5 million borrowers are in default and 4 million more could be in the same position in a few months, which would put nearly a quarter of the federal student loan portfolio in default, according to the Education Department. Less than 40% of borrowers are current on their student loan payments.",
      "In the next two weeks, those in default will receive emails informing them of the next steps and urging them to look into repayment options. Wage garnishment notices will be sent out later this summer.",

      "Former President Joe Biden sought to wipe out student loan debt for tens of millions of people during his four years in the White House, but the effort was repeatedly rejected by courts, including a 2023 ruling by the Supreme Court. Still, the Biden administration erased student loan debt for more than 5 million borrowers through other forgiveness programs.",

    "summary": "President Trump said he isn't planning on firing Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after calling Powell a \"major loser.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he has \"no intention of firing\"\u00a0Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after the president called Powell a \"major loser\" and publicly lobbied the central bank chief to lower interest rates at a faster clip.",
      "When asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he has any plans to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said he \"never did\" and claimed \"the press runs away with things\" \u2014 though he once again pressed Powell to cut interest rates, which remain elevated after the Fed hiked rates to quell inflation.",
      "\"This is a perfect time to lower interest rates,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If he doesn't, is it the end? No, it's not. But it would be good timing.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump argued in a social media post that Powell is \"always TOO LATE AND WRONG,\" and said his \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" drawing speculation that the president could try to oust Powell before his four-year term ends next year.",
      "Powell has led the Fed since 2018, after Mr. Trump initially nominated him for the job. Former President Joe Biden nominated Powell for a second term, bringing his time atop the central bank to at least May 2026.",
      "It's not clear if Mr. Trump has the power to fire Powell. According to federal law and past legal precedent, members of the Federal Reserve board \u2014 which includes the chair \u2014 can only be removed from their jobs before their terms expire \"for cause.\" However, the Trump administration has argued it has the legal right to fire members of other independent federal agencies, setting up a court fight over the issue that could have broad consequences.",
      "The administration will \"study\" whether it has the right to fire Powell, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told reporters last week.",
      "For his part, Powell\u00a0said last year he will not step down if Mr. Trump asks him to leave his job.",
      "Why is Trump criticizing Powell \u2014 and why does it matter?",
      "Mr. Trump's feud with Powell revolves around the Fed's decision to leave interest rates steady so far this year, after lowering rates from a decades-long high in late 2024. The decision has broad implications. Cutting interest rates can lead to higher economic growth and lower borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which is why Mr. Trump is lobbying for cuts. But lower rates can also boost inflation. And while the inflation rate is now well below its 2022 peak, it remains above the Fed's 2% year-over-year benchmark.",
      "Powell has cited \"uncertainty\" for the Fed's decision to pause rate cuts. Last week, Powell warned\u00a0that Mr. Trump's steep tariffs on foreign imports could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, posing a \"challenging scenario\" for the central bank.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump repeatedly lashed out at Powell on social media, calling him \"Mr. Too Late\" on Monday and arguing the Federal Reserve should slash rates more aggressively because there is \"virtually No Inflation.\"",
      "The showdown \u2014 and the possibility Mr. Trump could try to fire Powell \u2014 have sparked concerns about whether the Federal Reserve will maintain its independence, allowing it to make decisions about economic policy without political influence. Stocks slumped Monday amid concerns about upheaval at the Fed, before rebounding Tuesday.",
      "In an interview Sunday with \"Face the Nation,\" Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, warned that a loss of independence would \"undermine the credibility of the Fed.\" Countries without independent central banks typically have worse inflation, slower economic growth and more sluggish job markets, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday the president \"has the right to express...his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\" Leavitt also said Mr. Trump believes the Fed has \"been making moves and taking action in the name of politics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at Powell for years. The president sharply criticized Powell when the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, before calling the central banker his \"most improved player\" after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted steep rate cuts in 2020.",

    "summary": "Tesla's sales and stock price have taken a hit this year amid blowback over CEO Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is facing a corporate reckoning on Tuesday, with the electric car maker's first-quarter results showing sales and profit fell short of analyst expectations while the billionaire was focused on leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts.",
      "Ahead of the quarterly report, investors submitted questions to Tesla they hoped to get answered during the company's earnings conference call. A top issue flagged by investors is Elon Musk himself, with dozens asking about his focus on the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and when he might redirect his energies to running Tesla.",
      "\"Can Elon please provide some reassurance that at some point soon he will be done with DOGE and politics?\" one investor asked. \"Many Tesla shareholders wish he would reprioritize the majority of his time and effort to engineering.\"",
      "That's a question that Wall Street also wants answered. Tesla's stock price has plunged 53% from its most recent high in December, when the stock was pushed higher after President Trump's electoral victory on optimism that Musk's role advising Mr. Trump would help the EV maker's bottom line.",
      "But Musk's activities with DOGE \u2014 including cutting tens of thousands of federal workers and accessing taxpayers' personal data \u2014 have alienated some consumers and sparked protests across the globe, causing the stock price to deflate.",
      "Investors got an answer on Tuesday afternoon, with Musk announcing on a call to discuss the company's earnings that he plans to scale back his time spent on DOGE, beginning next month.",
      "\"Starting probably in next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musk said.",
      "But Musk added he plans to continue his involvement with DOGE throughout Mr. Trump's term, saying he will likely spend one to two days a week on government issues moving forward. \"Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" he said.",
      "Musk also defended his work on DOGE, saying that he needed to \"fight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the right track.\"",
      "Tariff impact",
      "The company cautioned that \"trade policy\" and \"changing political sentiment\" could impact demand for its products in the near term. Mr. Trump's tariffs are expected to result in higher prices for many vehicles, including Teslas.",
      "Musk also said he would like to see lower tariffs, but that the decision is Mr. Trump's. \"I'm advocating for lower tariffs, rather than higher, but that's all I can do,\" the Tesla CEO said in the earnings call.",
      "The company's first-quarter results were \"grim,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a note to investors. [E]xpectations were very low, but these are still bad numbers.\"",
      "Tesla's transformation into a symbol of the Trump administration has dampened demand for the vehicles, and could reduce demand for Tesla vehicles by 15% to 20% due to consumers who don't want to be associated with the billionaire, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a research note.",
      "\"Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,\" Ives concluded.",
      "What time is the Tesla earnings call?",
      "Tesla's earnings fell short of analyst expectations. The company reported a per-share profit of 27 cents, compared with an average forecast of 41 cents per share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.",
      "Net income tumbled 71% to $409 million, versus $1.39 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Sales slid 9% to $19.3 billion, far short of the $21.3 billion expected by analysts.",
      "Tesla shares, which have fallen 41% this year, were largely flat in after-hours trading.",
      "Earlier this month, Tesla said its delivery of vehicles in the first three months of 2025 fell nearly 13% as demand for the automaker's electric cars continued to weaken, with deliveries also falling well short of analysts' expectations.",
      "In assessing Tesla's latest financial results, Crisafulli thinks Tesla boosters are likely to focus on the company's plan to start testing its Robotaxi and a humanoid robot called Optimus later this year, as well as beginning production of a lower cost vehicle in the months ahead.",
      "But more bearish observers will conclude \"there's no reason to think things are about to get a lot better\" at Tesla, he said, adding that its Robotaxi service is well behind Alphabet's Waymo self-driving vehicle rollout.",
      "Under this view, \"Musk's personal brand has been permanently tarnished by his political activities in the last several months, and exiting DOGE won't change that. On top of all this, the stock remains very expensive,\" Crisafulli said.",
      "In addition to insights into Musk's role at Tesla, investors will also be listening for updates on several strategic initiatives. The company is expected to roll out a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y SUV, later in the year. Tesla has also said it plans to start a paid driverless robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June.",

The jump could augur a potential wave of\u00a0bankruptcy filings\u00a0as consumers start to buckle under a record level of debt and as\u00a0tariffs fuel inflation, the company warned in a report this week.",

Total household debt as of the end of 2024 hit an all-time of\u00a0$18 trillion, while the percentage of Americans falling seriously behind on their debts also rose last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "\"Quarterly filings from the U.S. courts will come out soon, and I'd expect to see a quarter-over-quarter increase in personal bankruptcy filings from the end of 2024 to the beginning of 2025,\" Pamela Foohey, a bankruptcy professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am not surprised attorneys say they're hearing from people who are looking to file for bankruptcy now because it's April. This is when people get their tax returns, so they have money to file for bankruptcy with,\" she added, noting that it costs money to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the most common type of personal filing. \"If they are getting their tax return, that's the time to file because they have an infusion of money.\"",
      "Economists warn that the Trump administration's economic policies, including heavy tariffs on China and other key trading partners, is likely to stoke inflation while dampening economic growth. Still, the flood of people weighing bankruptcy now reflects the steady rise in financial stress in recent years rather than current economic conditions, Foohey emphasized.",
      "\"Rising [bankruptcy] filings will show that people have been struggling with their finances for years when they do file, and things have been getting incrementally worse month after month now for years,\" she said. \"It's been building, and it's only going to get worse unless something is done about inflation, unless something is done about tariffs.\"",
      "When should you file for bankruptcy?",
      "As Foohey notes, bankruptcy typically comes after a prolonged period of financial stress. Although some Americans struggle to overcome the stigma of bankruptcy, experts recommend filing for protection sooner rather than later in order to shield their assets from creditors.",
      "Filing for bankruptcy can help an individual liquidate their assets to pay off their debt or create a repayment plan. Individuals may file for file\u00a0Chapter 7\u00a0or\u00a0Chapter 13\u00a0bankruptcy, and all bankruptcy cases are handled in federal courts.",
      "But bankruptcy expert Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign College of Law, said declaring bankruptcy accomplishes one thing: wiping out people's debt.",
      "\"It doesn't get you a job, it doesn't get you a raise, it doesn't put money on the table,\" he said. \"Filing for bankruptcy protection doesn't make sense when things are still on the way down. It makes sense to file when you're in the hole, but starting to climb out of it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Data shows the IRS' Direct File free tax-filing tool has helped save taxpayers money. Now lawmakers want to know why the Trump administration may soon pull the plug on the program.",
      "The Trump administration is planning on ending Direct File, the Associated Press reported earlier this month, citing people familiar with the plan. The program, launched during Joe Biden's presidency, has been credited by some users with making it easier and cheaper to file their taxes, saving the average user $160 in tax preparation fees and hours of their time, according to the Economic Security Project, an advocacy group focused on enhancing financial fairness and security for Americans.",
      "But the IRS has also faced blowback to Direct File from private tax prep companies that have made billions from charging people to use their software.",
      "\"Direct File is and has been a solution in search of a problem, a drain on critical IRS resources and a waste of taxpayer dollars,\" Derrick Plummer, a spokesman for the commercial tax preparation company Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, told the AP.",
      "DirectFile was used by about 141,000 taxpayers in 12 states when it debuted in 2024, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). Although it was expanded to 25 states in 2025, the IRS hasn't yet released data on how many people used it during the tax season that ended on April 15.",
      "$100 billion on tax prep",
      "Americans spend more than $100 billion each year to prepare and file their returns, according to the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. Direct File was developed as a method to help taxpayers avoid paying tax-prep and filing fees.",
      "However, Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation companies \u2014 including Intuit, the owner of TurboTax, H&R Block \u2014 have complained the Direct File program is a waste of taxpayer money because free filing programs already exist. One such service is Free File, a partnership between the IRS and tax-prep companies.",
      "On Monday, more than 170 Democratic and independent lawmakers sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and IRS acting commissioner Michael Faulkender asking them to commit to keeping Direct File open and operating. No Republican lawmakers signed the letter.",
      "\"Ending this free, easy-to-use and popular program would be an insult to American taxpayers, eliminating an important alternative to commercial options provided by the tax prep industry,\" the Democratic lawmakers, led by by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, wrote in the April 21 letter.",
      "Under the Trump administration, the IRS is undergoing a cost-cutting overhaul, with plans to eliminate up to 40% of its roughly 100,000-person workforce after the end of tax filing season, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News. The agency is also expected to shed more than 20,000 IRS employees through its Deferred Resignation Program offer.",
      "Those changes are part of the Trump administration's efforts, overseen by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut federal spending.",
      "\"No decisions on the future of Direct File have been made as of yet,\" a Treasury spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It is a failed program at a cost of tens of millions of taxpayer dollars per year.\"",
      "Pushback against Direct File",
      "Direct File has drawn pushback from some Republican lawmakers, with more than 20 GOP representatives asking President Trump to \"immediately end the IRS' unlawful Direct File pilot program upon taking office in January,\" according to a Dec. 10 statement from Rep. Adrian Smith, a Republican from Nebraska.",
      "\"The program's creation and ongoing expansion pose a threat to taxpayers' freedom from government overreach, and its shaky rollout and structural flaws have already come at a steep price,\" the Republican lawmakers said in their\u00a0letter.",
      "The IRS spent about $13 million on the Direct File pilot in 2024, according a December\u00a0report from the GAO. That funding came from money the tax agency received from the Inflation Reduction Act, which Mr. Biden signed into law in 2022.",
      "While consumer advocacy groups and some tax experts have praised Direct File for creating a free pathway for some taxpayers to file their returns, the service hasn't earned universal praise.",
      "Direct File was \"problematic\" from the start, David Williams, president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, which describes itself as a nonpartisan organization that disseminates research and analysis on the government's effects on the economy, told the AP.",
      "Pointing to the program's costs, Williams noted that many people who start the free-filing process never finish. According to the IRS, while 423,450 taxpayers logged into Direct File in 2024, only 140,803 of them submitted accepted returns.",
      "Despite those criticisms, taxpayers who have used Direct File give the program high marks. About 96% of taxpayers who used the 2024 pilot program said they were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with the service, a Code for America survey found.",
      "\"Taxpayers have spoken loudly and clearly: Direct File works well for them, and more Americans want access to it,\" the April 21 letter from Warren, Sanders and other lawmakers said.",

The projections reinforce economists' warnings about the negative repercussions of President Trump's tariffs on the economy.",
      "The U.S. economy will grow 1.8% this year, the IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook, down 0.9% from January and a full percentage point from last year's projection of 2.8%. Growth for 2026 is expected to be slightly lower at 1.7%.",

In response to his comments, Mr. Trump took aim at the Fed chair, writing in a\u00a0social media post\u00a0the following day that the central bank should be cutting interest rates.",
      "Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" the president wrote.",
      "Uncertainty over Mr. Trump's trade policy is what's driving the IMF's projection of a U.S. economic slowdown. The international financial agency said trade was stable in 2024 and was expected to remain that way, but that the landscape changed in light of America's tariff war with trade partners.",
      "\"This on its own is a major negative shock to growth,\" an executive summary of the monetary fund's report said.",
      "Tariffs have already thrown sand in the gears of U.S. small businessess, the American auto industry, and other sectors that import their supplies from abroad.",
      "The trade war also led to a weaker forecast for China, one of America's top trading partners. The IMF projects the country's economy will expand 4% this year, down roughly half a point from its previous forecast. President Trump's\u00a0tariffs on China now total 145%. China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods total 125%.",
      "The IMF's forecasts were finalized April 4, just after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs. The international agency warned that further escalation of the trade war could stymie both near- and long-term growth. However, given the forecast hinges on policy, if Mr. Trump backs down on his tariff threats \u2014 reciprocal tariffs introduced on April 2 are currently on pause for 90 days \u2014 it could reshape the IMF's outlook.",

    "story": [
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Thursday that the Kremlin is \"ready to reach a deal\" with the U.S. on Ukraine, though he also said some elements need to be \"fine tuned.\"",
      "\"The President of the United States believes, and I think rightly so, that we are moving in the right direction,\" Lavrov said in an interview Thursday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Lavrov declined to say what is being discussed in negotiations or whether any deal was imminent. He said the negotiations are \"not supposed to be public.\"",
      "\"The negotiations continue, and until the end of the negotiations, we cannot disclose what it is about,\" Lavrov said.",
      "The comments came after Russia struck Kyiv overnight Thursday, killing at least eight people and injuring more than 70, in the deadliest assault on the Ukrainian capital in months as President Trump pushes a proposal for an end to the war.",
      "Asked by Brennan what made it worth killing civilians after Ukraine had said in March that it's ready for a ceasefire, Lavrov said \"we only target military goals or civilian sites used by the military,\" adding that \"President Putin expressed this for so many times, and this is not different this time as well.\"",
      "Lavrov suggested that the attack was intentional, arguing that \"if this was a target used by the Ukrainian military,\" then the minister of defense and commanders in the field \"have the right to attack them.\"",
      "Still, on the talks with Ukraine, there are \"several signs that we are moving in the right direction,\" Lavrov said. Among them, he cited Mr. Trump as \"probably the only leader on Earth who recognized the need to address the root causes of this situation.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump issued a rare rebuke of the Russian president in a post on Truth Social Thursday morning, saying he's \"not happy\" with the Kyiv strikes, while noting that they took place as he worked to reach a peace deal. It was \"very bad timing,\" he said and addressed Putin, saying, \"Vladimir, STOP!\"",
      "Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, after first sending troops into eastern Ukraine in 2014. Russia has claimed its offensive invasion was provoked by Ukraine and the West, an assertion that has been rejected by the U.S. and Europe.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he believes Russia wants peace and continues to publicly criticize Ukraine's democratically elected leader, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in spite of Ukraine's acceptance of his proposed 30-day ceasefire. And along the campaign trail, he pledged to negotiate an end to the war in a day. But almost 100 days into his administration, an agreement eludes him.",
      "On Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance warned that Russia and Ukraine must reach a peace deal, as envoys from the U.K., France, the U.S, Ukraine and Germany met in London. Vance said the White House has \"issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it's time for them to either say yes, or for the United States to walk away from this process.\"",
      "Vance said the window for diplomacy was closing, and the U.S. envisions a freeze of military conflict more or less along existing lines. The Institute for the Study of War estimates that Russia holds roughly 18% of Ukrainian territory. In the meantime, U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg met in London with European allies and Ukraine on Wednesday. European partners are concerned that the U.S. position is focused on pressuring Ukraine, which is the victim of the Russian invasion, and not extracting any concessions to date from the aggressor.",
      "Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump accused Zelenskyy of prolonging the conflict by saying he wouldn't accept Russian control of Crimea as part of a ceasefire agreement. Crimea, located in Ukraine's southern peninsula, has been occupied by Russia since 2014.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a post that the U.S. had not asked Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian territory, though he also said, \"Crimea was lost years ago,\" while Barack Obama was president. Mr. Trump said the parties are \"very close to a Deal, but the man with 'no cards to play' should now, finally, GET IT DONE.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Thursday afternoon that \"we're putting a lot of pressure on Russia,\" although it was unclear what pressure he was referencing. The U.S. has not placed new sanctions on Russia, and the president has argued he considers it a concession by Putin that he has not seized Ukraine in its entirety. Mr. Trump reiterated that he thinks Russia \"wants to make a deal,\" but \"it takes two to tango.\"",
      "\"You have to have Ukraine want to make a deal too, and they're being hit very hard, and I do believe they want to make a deal,\" the president said.",
      "Zelenskyy reposted on social media a 2018 statement by then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about Crimea that said, \"the United States reaffirms as policy its refusal to recognize the Kremlin's claims of sovereignty over territory seized by force in contravention of international law.\"",

      "The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, admitted in a court filing that immigration agents typically need warrants before arresting individuals.

      "While it has not accused Khalil of any criminal wrongdoing, the Trump administration has cited two legal grounds to argue the Columbia University activist should nonetheless be deported from the U.S.",
      "The administration has accused Khalil of committing immigration fraud by withholding certain information on his green card application and argued he's also deportable due to a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that his presence and activities pose \"adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S. Khalil's lawyers have refuted both accusations.",
      "Earlier this month, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled the administration could continue its bid to deport Khalil, saying she could not second-guess Rubio's determination, which cites a rarely used law. She held in abeyance the immigration fraud accusation.",

      "That immigration court case in Louisiana is progressing alongside a lawsuit in federal district court in New Jersey challenging the legality of Khalil's detention. Lawyers in that case have asked the federal judge overseeing it to order Khalil's release, revoke Rubio's determination and bar the government from targeting noncitizens \"who engage in constitutionally protected expressive activity in the United States in support of Palestinian rights or critical of Israel.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday agreed to block portions of President Trump's executive order that seeks to overhaul U.S. elections, including a provision that would require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship in order to register to vote in federal elections.",
      "U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly agreed to partially grant a preliminary injunction sought by three different groups of plaintiffs, including voting rights groups and the Democratic Party, finding that they are likely to prevail in their challenge.",
      "The judge blocked the Trump administration from implementing two provisions of the executive order signed by the president last month: the first orders the Election Assistance Commission, a federal independent regulatory commission, to add a \"documentary proof of U.S. citizenship\" requirement to the standardized national voter registration form; and the second ordered federal voter registration agencies to \"assess\" citizenship before providing a federal voter registration form to people who receive public assistance.",
      "Kollar-Kotelly, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, said that the president generally does not have the power to regulate federal elections.",
      "\"Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the states \u2014not the president \u2014 with the authority to regulate federal elections,\" Kollar-Kotelly wrote in a 120-page opinion. \"Consistent with that allocation of power, Congress is currently debating legislation that would effect many of the changes the president purports to order. And no statutory delegation of authority to the executive branch permits the president to short-circuit Congress's deliberative process by executive order.\"",
      "In response to the decision, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, said, \"President Trump will keep fighting for election integrity, despite Democrat objections that reveal their disdain for commonsense safeguards like verifying citizenship. Free and fair elections are the bedrock of our Constitutional Republic, and we're confident in securing an ultimate victory in the courtroom.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's directive follows years of unfounded claims raised by him and his allies that the 2020 election was rigged against him, allegations the president has continued to amplify during his second term in the White House. The order claims that the U.S. \"now fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections employed by modern, developed nations, as well as those still developing.\"",
      "\"Free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional Republic. The right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election,\" the executive order states.",
      "While Congress has the power to decide how federal elections are run, and has done so through laws like the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act, the Constitution gives state legislatures the authority to set the \"times, places and manner\" of holding elections.",
      "In addition to the now-blocked citizenship-related requirements, the president's executive order seeks to give the White House's Department of Government Efficiency and states access to certain databases to identify any noncitizens who are registered to vote; orders the attorney general to enforce two laws against states that include absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day in the final tally of votes for president and Congress; and orders the Election Assistance Commission to condition federal funds on states adopting Election Day as the deadline for receiving ballots.",
      "Those provisions were at the center of the lawsuits filed by a slew of voting rights groups and arms of the Democratic Party, including the Democratic National Committee and the party's congressional leaders. They argued that the president did not have the power to issue those changes and could not make them unilaterally.",
      "Kollar-Kotelly agreed that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their challenge to two sections of the order, requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the federal voter registration form and requiring people enrolled in public assistance programs to have their citizenship assessed before getting the federal voter registration form.",
      "But she declined to stop the Trump administration from implementing the other parts of the president's order as the litigation moves forward.",
      "The Justice Department will likely appeal the decision.",
      "As to the proof-of-citizenship requirement, Kollar-Kotelly wrote neither the Constitution nor federal voter registration law gives the president the authority to direct the Election Assistance Commission to change what is on the federal registration form.",
      "\"The president is free to state his views about what policies he believes that Congress, the EAC, or other federal agencies should consider or adopt. But in this case, the president has done much more than state his views: He has issued an 'order' directing that an independent commission 'shall' act to 'require' changes to an important document, the contents of which Congress has tightly regulated,\" the judge wrote. \"That command exceeds the president's authority.\"",
      "On the second provision that Kollar-Kotelly blocked, she said people applying for public assistance programs are entitled to the federal voter registration form, not recipients who have complied with the identification requirements imposed by the programs.",
      "She said provisions of the National Voter Registration Act \"make clear that voter registration agencies' only role in enforcing states' citizenship requirement for voting is to provide the federal form to the applicant, who must then self-certify citizenship by signing the application 'under penalty of perjury.' The statute leaves no role for agencies to 'assess citizenship,' and the president lacks any lawful authority to contravene the NVRA by requiring agencies to do so.\"",
      "Roman Palomares, national president of the voting rights group LULAC, cheered Kollar-Kotelly's decision as a victory for voters and democracy.",
      "\"Efforts to silence the voice and votes of the U.S. electorate must not stand because our democracy depends on all voters feeling confident that they can vote freely and that their vote will be counted accurately,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and co-counsel partners, which are representing the League of Women Voters, said in a joint statement that the judge's decision provides protections for eligible voters, many of which do not have easy access to a passport or other citizenship documents.",
      "\"The president's attempted takeover of federal elections is a blatant overreach to seize power that doesn't belong to him. Under the Constitution, that power belongs to the U.S. Congress and states,\" they said. \"The president lacks authority to rewrite the country's election rules on his own by weaponizing an independent, bipartisan commission to harm eligible voters. The order should ultimately be struck down.\"",

      "A New Hampshire federal judge on Thursday restricted the Trump administration's ability to cut or withhold federal funding from public schools that participate in some diversity and equity initiatives.",
      "U.S. District Judge Landya McCafferty, appointed by former President Barack Obama, found that actions by the Trump administration and Education Secretary Linda McMahon to withhold funds would \"cripple the operations of many educational institutions,\" and are a violation of executive branch power in overseeing local school districts.",
      "The ruling is not nationwide, and is limited to any public schools that work with the plaintiffs in the case, the National Education Association and the Center for Black Educator Development. The NEA is America's largest teachers union, with more than 3 million members.",
      "The suit was filed after the Trump administration demanded that all 50 states agree that their public schools would not participate in programs that violate the Trump administration's definition of violating the 1964 Civil Rights Act.",
      "In a February letter to states, the Education Department asserted that U.S. public schools have embraced \"pervasive and repugnant race-based preferences,\" that \"emanated throughout every facet of academia,\" including schools engaging with the \"false premise that the United State is built upon 'systemic and structural racism.'\"",
      "The letter instructed schools to ensure that their policies \"comply with existing civil rights laws,\" or risk potentially losing billions in Title I money that helps low-income students across the country.",
      "If the Trump administration succeeded with its attempts to keep diversity efforts out of schools, McCafferty wrote that public schools would likely eliminate teaching roles that involve race or censor teachers who teach about race.",
      "\"Would the Department conclude that a history teacher leading a class discussion on the economic development of the antebellum south has violated Title VI? What about an English teacher assigning students to write a paper comparing the persecution of Tom Robinson\u2014whom Atticus Finch championed in To Kill a Mockingbird\u2014to that of Emmett Till? And how would such lessons even relate to a \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" program?\" McCafferty wrote in her opinion. \"These are not hypotheticals. School teachers throughout the country are asking themselves these and similar questions in the wake of the 2025 Letter.\"",
      "McCafferty also found that the Trump administration's definition of diversity, equity and inclusion as unlawful is \"in stark contrast to the dictionary definition of DEI\" and \"inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the phrase.\"",
      "National Education Association President Becky Pringle said in a statement to reporters that \"today's ruling allows educators and schools to continue to be guided by what's best for students, not by the threat of illegal restrictions and punishment.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said President Trump is \"protecting the civil rights of all Americans by ending radical DEI programs that violate Supreme Court precedent in order to safeguard the Constitution's promise of equality before the law. Any judge objecting to this effort is making a mockery of the Constitution they swore an oath to uphold.\"",
      "The crackdown on diversity and equity programs in schools is part of a broader rebuke of DEI initiatives by the Trump administration. Shortly after taking office, Mr. Trump signed executive orders directing an end to diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government, and required federal contractors to certify that they do not engage in certain DEI initiatives.",

Hours later, Xinis granted a stay of the discovery process until April 30 at 5 p.m. with \"the agreement of the parties.\"",
      "The reason for the stay is unclear since both parties' filings are sealed. Xinis did not explain her reasoning.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, told CBS News in a statement his team is \"not at liberty to speak about the current status of the case at this time,\" citing the seal on the court documents. \"We remain focused on bringing Kilmar Abrego Garcia home, and we will not rest until he is brought home,\" he added.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "Xinis' decision to stay discovery for a week came one day after Abrego Garcia's legal team accused the Trump administration of failing to follow her order for expedited discovery in the case. In a scathing order Tuesday, Xinis said the administration had shown a \"willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations,\" and ordered the government to respond to questions by Wednesday at 6 p.m.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who entered the U.S. illegally in 2011, was detained last month and flown to El Salvador, part of a wave of hundreds of migrants \u2014 including alleged gang members \u2014 sent by the Trump administration to the country's notorious Terrorist Confinement Center (CECOT) supermax prison. A judge previously barred Abrego Garcia from being removed to El Salvador in 2019, citing the risk of persecution by the country's gangs.",
      "The Trump administration conceded in court Abrego Garcia's deportation was an \"administrative error,\" but has declined to return him to the U.S., accusing him of membership in the MS-13 gang \u2014 which his lawyers deny, noting he hasn't been charged with a crime.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has turned into a legal showdown. Xinis ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" his return to the U.S., which the Supreme Court affirmed, but the administration has argued it's up to El Salvador to return him. Xinis has suggested the government hasn't adequately complied with her orders.",
      "The U.S. has claimed that much of the information is protected because it involves state secrets, government deliberations and attorney client privilege. But Xinis has rejected the argument and demanded that the Trump administration provide specific justifications for each claim of privileged information by Wednesday evening.",
      "A three-judge panel on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals scolded the administration last week, saying its claim that it can't do anything to free Abrego Garcia \"should be shocking.\" That ruling came one day after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt in a different case for violating his orders to turn around planes carrying deportees to El Salvador.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 13:23:57 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order that directed the Pentagon to develop a policy that would bar transgender people from serving in the military.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to allow his administration's policy prohibiting transgender people from serving in the military to take effect while legal challenges to the ban move forward.",
      "The request for the Supreme Court's intervention comes after a federal appeals court left in place a lower court order that prevents the Trump administration from enforcing the ban nationwide. The administration has attacked these broad orders, known as nationwide or universal injunctions, issued by federal district court judges as improperly setting policy for the country.",
      "Mr. Trump banned transgender people from serving in the military during his first term in office, which the Supreme Court in 2019 allowed to take effect,\u00a0but the policy was rescinded by former President Joe Biden. When Mr. Trump returned to office in January for his second term, he issued a new executive order that declared it to be U.S. government policy to \"establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity,\" and said that policy is \"inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria.\"",
      "The president's directive said that \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life. A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\"",
      "On the heels of the president's order, the Defense Department issued a new policy in February that generally disqualifies from military service people with gender dysphoria or who have undergone medical interventions for gender dysphoria. The plan from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth required all military branches to start identifying transgender service members and begin the process of separating them from service on March 26 unless they obtained a waiver.",
      "Roughly 1,892 active-duty members of the military received gender-affirming care from the Defense Department between January 2016 and May 2021, according to a\u00a0January report\u00a0from the Congressional Research Service. The Justice Department has said that the Pentagon does not have data on service members by gender identity, but a defense official said that as of Dec. 9, there were about 4,200 troops who had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. There are more than 1.2 million active-duty members of the military, according to the Defense Department.",
      "Between 2015 and 2024, the Defense Department spent $52 million for care to active-duty service members to treat gender dysphoria, according to a\u00a0Feb. 26 memo\u00a0from the Pentagon.",
      "The case before the Supreme Court arose out a challenge to the ban filed in Washington state, which was brought by seven transgender service members, one transgender person who wants to join the military and an advocacy group. They argued that the president's ban violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and the First Amendment.",
      "A federal district court in March agreed to block implementation of the executive order and required the Trump administration to maintain the policy put in place by its predecessor.",
      "In his opinion granting a preliminary injunction, U.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle said the Trump administration did not put forth any evidence that allowing transgender people to serve openly harmed military readiness, unit cohesion or lethality.",
      "\"The government's unrelenting reliance on deference to military judgment is unjustified in the absence of any evidence supporting 'the military's' new judgment reflected in the Military Ban \u2014 in its equally considered and unquestionable judgment, that very same military had only the week before permitted active-duty plaintiffs (and some thousands of others) to serve openly,\" he wrote.",
      "Settle was appointed to the district court in Tacoma by President George W. Bush and was a captain in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps, serving as a prosecutor in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and defense counsel in Fort Lewis, Washington.",
      "Settle wrote in his opinion that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, and said they raised \"serious and important questions.\"",
      "\"Because the military has operated smoothly for four years under the Austin Policy, any claimed hardship it may face in the meantime pales in comparison to the hardships imposed on transgender service members and otherwise qualified transgender accession candidates, tipping the balance of hardships sharply toward plaintiffs,\" he said, referencing former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who led the Pentagon under Biden. \"There can be few matters of greater public interest in this country than protecting the constitutional rights of its citizens.\"",
      "The Justice Department then asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to pause that decision, allowing it the ban to take effect, but it denied the request.",
      "A similar challenge to Mr. Trump's ban was filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., where it, too, was blocked from taking effect. But the federal appeals court in Washington agreed to temporarily halt that order and heard arguments Tuesday on whether to keep its block in place while the appeal continues.",
      "In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the courts should give \"substantial deference\" to the Defense Department's military judgments.",
      "\"Absent a stay, the district court's universal injunction will remain in place for the duration of further review in the Ninth Circuit and in this court \u2014 a period far too long for the military to be forced to maintain a policy that it has determined, in its professional judgment, to be contrary to military readiness and the nation's interests,\" he wrote.",
      "Sauer rejected the claim that the administration's rules discriminate based on transgender status and sex and said the policy draws classifications based on a medical condition \u2014 gender dysphoria \u2014 and related medical interventions, which means it satisfies the lowest, most deferential standard of judicial review.",
      "\"The Constitution entrusts to the political branches the authority to determine the composition of the armed forces. The department exercised that authority in adopting the 2025 policy to exclude 'individuals who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria,'\" he wrote. \"The district court's injunction nevertheless forces the military to maintain a different policy \u2014 one that the department has concluded is inconsistent with 'the best interests of the military services' and with 'the interests of national security.'\"",
      "The Supreme Court has given the plaintiffs until May 1 to respond to the Trump administration's request for emergency relief.",

      "Unfounded rumors swirled online after Obama was absent from the inauguration as well as former President Jimmy Carter's funeral.",
      "The decision wasn't easy for her, she said.",
      "\"It took everything in my power to not do the thing that was right, or that was perceived as right, but do the thing that was right for me. That was a hard thing for me to do,\" Obama said. \"I had to basically trick myself out of it, and it started with not having anything to wear.\"",
      "\"I walk around with the right dress, I travel with clothes just in case something pops off,\" she explained. \"So I was like, if I'm not going to do this thing, I gotta tell my team, I don't even want to have a dress ready, right? Because it's so easy to just say, 'let me do the right thing.'\"",
      "Henson commended Obama for her choice, saying if she doesn't make choices for herself, she becomes \"a shock absorber.\"",
      "\"And that's what women are. We're shock absorbers, and that's exhausting and it's not healthy,\" Henson said. \"You've had to be shock absorbers for your husband, for your children, for your mom, for your family, your loved ones because of where you were sitting in the public eye.

      "Obama said she's still working on doing things solely for herself, but wants to set an example for her daughters, Malia, 26, and Sasha, 23, and others.",

      "After the dinner offer was posted on the $TRUMP meme coin website and X account, the value of the meme coin surged as much as $5.32, or 58%, to $14.32 on Wednesday afternoon. That gain only partially erased the meme coin's decline in value, which hit a peak of $75.35 on January 19 the day before Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "The dinner offer promises $TRUMP coin investors the opportunity to \"Hear close-up, from President Trump, about the future of Crypto!\" Mr. Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, has also pushed his own ventures into the realm of digital products, issuing everything from NFTs billed as \"Trump digital trading cards\" to a cryptocurrency platform called World Liberty Financial.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order aiming to change the college accreditation process so colleges are accredited based on \"results,\" with the president wondering aloud about looking into the math capabilities of students admitted to Harvard University and Yale University.",
      "The president also signed an order to enforce laws on the books requiring universities to disclose when they accept large foreign gifts, with one of Mr. Trump's top aides specifically calling out Harvard as a school they believe has violated the law. Federal law requires higher education institutions that receive federal funds to disclose any gifts or contracts from a foreign source valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year, and some in Congress are trying to lower that threshold to $50,000.",
      "The new executive orders come as the president has singled out Harvard University. His administration has frozen billions in federal funding to Harvard, demanded sweeping changes to school policies and suggested it should lose its tax-exempt status.",
      "Colleges and universities are accredited to ensure they meet basic standards by third-party entities, not the federal government, though the Department of Education decides which accrediting agencies to recognize. The accreditation process has broad implications since the government uses it to\u00a0determine which schools are allowed to participate in federal student aid programs, which distribute billions in student loans and grants.",
      "The executive order directs the Department of Education to \"hold accountable\" any college accreditors that \"fail to meet the applicable recognition criteria or otherwise violate Federal law\" \u2014 including by terminating or suspending the accreditors' federal recognition. It specifically singles out accrediting agencies that require schools to \"engage in unlawful discrimination ... under the guise of 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' initiatives.\" The order also says the Department of Education should start recognizing new college accreditors.",
      "The Trump administration believes accreditation entities have become too focused on \"woke ideology\" instead of results, White House staff secretary Will Scharf said. The executive order Mr. Trump signed affects law schools and graduate programs as well.",
      "\"The basic idea is to force accreditation to be focused on the merit and the actual results that these universities are providing, as opposed to how woke these universities have gotten,\" Scharf said ahead of Mr. Trump signing the executive order. \"So we're setting up new accreditation pathways, we're charging the Department of Education to really look holistically at this accreditation mess and hopefully make it much better.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wanted to know if the executive order he was signing will \"look into\" people who he says go to prestigious schools like Harvard or Princeton but can't do basic math.",
      "\"Will we look into the past people that they've taken?\" Mr. Trump asked Scharf. \"For instance, I hear all about certain great schools. And then we read where they're going to teach people basic math, math that we can all do very easily, but they can't do there.\"",
      "\"When universities are not performing appropriately, whether that's in admission or whether that's in their actual instructional activities, that's certainly something that accreditors should be considering that right now we believe they're not doing a good enough job of,\" Scharf responded.",
      "The president also signed an executive order charging federal departments and agencies to make sure universities are following the law in disclosing the acceptance of large foreign gifts.",
      "\"We believe that certain universities, including, for example, Harvard, have routinely violated this law and this law has not been effectively enforced,\" Scharf said. \"So this executive order charges your departments and agencies with enforcing the laws on the books with respect to foreign gifts to American universities.\"",
      "Scharf didn't offer evidence or details on how Harvard has allegedly violated the foreign gift disclosure law. Harvard told CBS News in a statement it has filed foreign gift reporting reports \"for decades as part of its ongoing compliance with the law.\"",
      "Harvard University on Monday announced it filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging the administration unlawfully froze billions in federal funding. Tensions have escalated between the administration and Harvard, which had\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership. Several other schools, including Columbia University, have faced similar funding freezes, with the Trump administration alleging the schools have responded inadequately to antisemitism.",
      "The president on Wednesday also signed executive actions to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), make sure schoolchildren are adequately trained in artificial intelligence, boost apprenticeships and allow educators to enforce school discipline policies.",

    "story": [
      "The chief executives of Walmart and Target privately warned President Trump this week that his sweeping tariff policy could disrupt supply chains and lead to empty shelves in the coming weeks, sources familiar with the White House meeting told CBS News.",
      "The CEO of Home Depot was also present at Monday's closed-door meeting. Axios was first to report on the retail executives' warnings to Mr. Trump.",
      "Target and Walmart declined to comment on the specific warnings.",
      "Following their meeting with Mr. Trump on Monday, both companies did issue statements.",
      "\"We had a productive meeting with President Trump and his team and appreciated the opportunity to share our insights,\" Walmart said in a statement.",
      "Target, in a similar statement, said \"we had a productive meeting with President Trump and our retail peers to discuss the path forward on trade, and we remain committed to delivering value for American consumers.\"",
      "The two retailers have publicly warned that Mr. Trump's tariffs could lead to higher prices. Weeks after Mr. Trump's election win, Walmart CFO John David Rainey told CNBC, \"We never want to raise prices,\" but \"there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers.\"",
      "And last month, Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC, \"the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days\" from tariffs planned on imports from Mexico, noting Target heavily relies on Mexican produce to stock its grocery shelves in the winter.",
      "The Trump administration has imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese goods and 10% tariffs on most other countries. Mr. Trump also announced steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of other U.S. trading partners earlier this month, but paused most of the non-China levies for 90 days.",
      "The import duties have rattled markets in recent weeks and prompted fears about rising consumer prices, slower economic growth and supply chain shortfalls. The Trump administration has considered forming a working group to handle any strains on supply chains caused by the China tariffs, CBS News reported last week.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood by his tariff strategy, casting it as a way to boost U.S. manufacturing and stymie what he views as unfair trade practices \u2014 but he has indicated he would like to negotiate new trade deals with other countries. The president told reporters Tuesday he expects the 145% China tariffs to \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero.\"",

    "story": [
      "Lindsay Brown was working from home in Little Rock, Arkansas, when, during a company meeting in February, her employer said that due to the United States Agency for International Development  not making payments to the organization, staff changes needed to happen.",
      "Brown, who worked in internal communications for the nonprofit FHI 360, has been furloughed since shortly after that meeting.",
      "She learned that her last day at FHI 360 will be May 2.",
      "She is one of the close to 20,000 employees \u2014 many living in states such as North Carolina, Vermont, California and Georgia \u2014   who lost their jobs as the Trump administration took steps to shutter USAID.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has authority over the agency, said on Tuesday that the government plans to make staffing cuts, eliminating every position at the agency not required by law, and consolidate domestic offices at the State Department. The impending cuts are most likely to be felt by workers outside of Washington, D.C., already reeling from the decimation of their livelihoods and fields.",
      "USAID provided federal funding to hundreds of companies, organizations and universities to help run programs and research dedicated to various aspects of foreign aid. These companies employed people around the country, many of whom have already been furloughed, and are now finding out their positions have been eliminated.",
      "USAIDstopwork, a website tracking the economic impact of the USAID funding cuts, determined that\u00a019,187 American jobs\u00a0have been lost as of Wednesday. The tracker found\u00a0a total of 46 states were affected by job cuts and that, outside of Maryland and Virginia, some of the most impacted states were North Carolina, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts and California. In Georgia, for example, USAID funded 18 organizations that ran 79 programs, and 44 of those programs were shuttered, leading to layoffs and an estimated loss of $257.9 million.",
      "For workers living in states outside the beltway, job loss can be particularly isolating.",
      "\"I have used all my savings during this furlough while FHI 360 fights to get the government to pay what it is owed. Being in Arkansas and getting resources like unemployment has been very difficult,\" Brown told CBS News. She said the organization has communicated with staff about the impending cuts, but it didn't make the layoffs any easier.",
      "CEO Tessie San Martin posted on LinkedIn last week that the company terminated 480 U.S. employees, including 140 in North Carolina, where it's headquartered.",
      "\"FHI 360 is not alone in experiencing this type of impact,\" San Martin wrote. \"Foreign service nationals, USAID staff, colleagues in our sector, and technical experts worldwide are all part of what has been an important sector in the U.S. economy.\"",
      "Wayan Vota was working from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, for the international development organization Humentum\u00a0when he was laid off in February. He said employees were stunned as companies laid off people left and right.",
      "\"Layoff trauma hit across the country,\" said Vota, adding the pain of USAID cuts extend beyond federal workers living in Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia. He pointed to his newsletter Career Pivot, which he started in the aftermath of the mass cuts in February as a way to help fellow contractors and federal workers who were affected by the USAID cuts. It's already grown to an audience of more than 12,000 subscribers as more federal agencies face staffing and budget cuts, he told CBS News.",
      "He anticipates the crisis will get worse when the remaining USAID workers who are still receiving their salaries stop getting paid. The vast majority of USAID employees will lose their jobs on either July 1 or Sept. 2, according to a memorandum to staff obtained by CBS News.",
      "Vota said several job seekers living outside the Washington, D.C., corridor are searching for work in the private sector or state government. Others are exiting the formal job market, he said, because the type of work they did is limited in the state where they live. Vota said job seekers tell him, \"I don't see anything I can or want to do in the formal job market, so I am going to take any job, driving Ubers, waiting tables, cause my dream is dead and I'm not sure what I'm going to do next.\"",
      "Kasia Hatcher, 45, moved from Virginia to Georgia after her position at EnCompass was terminated and was eventually shut down due to funding loss.",
      "Hatcher, who has worked in international development for 20 years, said watching all the job losses was heartbreaking and \"all was gone in what seemed like overnight.\"",
      "She said she spent 20 years building up experience where people knew her work and the quality of her work \u2013 and it was daunting to have to build again. She's been searching for work in human resources in the Atlanta area and said she remains hopeful she'll find something soon.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 20:02:07 -0400",
    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has not given any press briefings in the briefing room but has used the room as a backdrop for TV hits with Fox News.",
    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently ordered modifications to a room next to the Pentagon press briefing room to retrofit it with a makeup studio that can be used to prepare for television appearances, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "The price tag for the project was several thousand dollars, according to two of the sources, at a time when the administration is searching for cost-cutting measures.",
      "\"Changes and upgrades to the Pentagon Briefing Room are nothing new and routinely happen during changes in an administration,\" a Defense Department spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The renovation that was initially planned was estimated to cost more than $40,000, but the ideas were scaled back, sources said.",
      "After CBS News published its report, the defense secretary responded in a post on X, \"Totally fake story. No 'orders' and no 'makeup.'\"",
      "Hegseth, before becoming defense secretary, was a morning show co-host on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends Weekend.\" Since his nomination, he has vowed to emphasize improvements in the armed forces' warfighting abilities and military readiness.",
      "An in-house construction crew renovated the adjacent green room earlier this year. The room previously had minimal furnishings \u2014 a table with chairs, a TV, photos of former defense secretaries and a mirror on the back of the door, one source said.",
      "The table was removed and a new chair and large mirror with makeup lighting was installed, another source said.",
      "Hegseth is doing his own makeup ahead of TV appearances, not paying for a makeup artist, a defense official told CBS News.",
      "The suggestion for improving the space came from Tami Radabaugh, the deputy assistant to the secretary for strategic engagement and a former producer for Fox News and for CBS News, according to multiple sources. The chief Pentagon spokesman, Sean Parnell, and the defense secretary's wife, Jennifer Hegseth, also a former Fox producer, expressed their approval for the upgrade before it was undertaken, one of the sources said.",
      "The Defense Department spokesperson said the green room will be available to senior leaders and VIPs prior to press engagements.",
      "The new items, including a director's chair, came from existing inventories, the spokesperson said. A new countertop was constructed by facilities services staff.",
      "\"For this upgrade we were deliberately conservative and opted for several less expensive, on-hand materiel solutions,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Hegseth hasn't used the press room to brief reporters. But it has been a set for his TV appearances, including one with Fox this week in which he blamed the media and former Defense Department employees for the revelation that he sent sensitive details about military strikes in a Signal group chat that he created.",
      "He did not deny news reports that he shared real-time operational information with family members before strikes in Yemen were carried out. He didn't explain why his wife, who is not a Defense Department employee, was in the text chat. That was the second Signal group with whom Hegseth shared planning details about the Houthi airstrikes, which took place in mid-March. The first Signal chat, a principals group which comprised top national security officials, was created by national security adviser Michael Waltz, and its existence was exposed by Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who was added to the group in error by Waltz.",
      "Hegseth claims he did not disclose classified information in either of the chat groups. The Defense Department acting inspector general is reviewing his disclosures.",
      "\"We're focused on recruiting, on rooting out DEI, on securing our southwest border, on the president's agenda, and it's going very well at the Pentagon, and I'm proud of it,\" Hegseth said Tuesday on Fox.",
      "The Pentagon restricted access to its briefing room on Feb. 21, barring reporters unless officials were speaking. Previously, press could use the room, one of the few places they could connect to Wi-Fi in the secure building, to file stories and to conduct on-camera reports.",

      "\"I truly love the job of being a United States senator, but in my heart I know it is time to pass the torch. So, I am announcing today I will not be seeking reelection at the end of my term,\" Durbin said in a video posted to his social media accounts.",
      "When he finishes his current term, Durbin will be tied with former Illinois Sen. Shelby Collum, who served from 1883 to 1913, as the longest-serving U.S. senator in Illinois history.",
      "Durbin, 80, expressed his gratitude to the people of Illinois for electing him to the Senate for so many years, and said he was honored by the responsibility bestowed on him.",
      "\"Right now the challenges facing our country are historic and unprecedented,\" he continued. \"The threats to our democracy and our way of life are very real, and I can assure you, I'll do everything in my power to fight for Illinois and the future of our country every day of my remaining time in the Senate.\"",
      "Durbin called his fellow Illinois senator, Tammy Duckworth, a \"trusted friend and effective leader,\" and said she will be a \"real asset\" to the state and the nation as Illinois' next senior senator.",

      "He is the 5th most senior member of the Senate, and also serves at the Senate Democratic Whip, the second-highest ranking position for the party in the Senate. He was first elected to this leadership post by Senate Democrats in 2005, and has been reelected to it every two years since.",
      "Durbin is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He also serves on the Appropriations Committee and the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. His retirement is expected to serve as the impetus for a broader shakeup of the Democratic Senate leadership.",
      "He introduced the Dream Act, which would give undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and grew up here a path to citizenship, in 2001 alongside Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). He was also a force behind the establishment of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival Program, or DACA, created by President Barack Obama in 2012.",

      "While no one has officially signaled their intentions to toss their names into the ring for Durbin's seat, some of the Illinois politicians most often talked about as a potential replacements include 14th District U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton and 8th District U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi.",
      "Colleagues pay tribute to Durbin's career",
      "A number of legislators took time Wednesday morning to share tributes to Durbin's long career in politics.",

      "\"Known for his legendary work ethic, Senator Durbin has led the fight to expand access to affordable health care, invest in our state's infrastructure, tackle gun violence, defend Dreamers, improve public health, protect working families, and more. His expert leadership on the Senate Judiciary Committee ensured the confirmation of a record 235 federal judges, shaping the courts and securing our most fundamental American rights for many years to come.\"",
      "Speaking at an event in Decatur, Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker honored Durbin, saying, \"Let's all recognize someone serving us for decades in Washington D.C., representing the state of Illinois with enormous integrity and honor, is something we should all appreciate no matter what political party someone belongs to.\"",
      "Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said Durbin \"has given Illinois a lifetime of principled leadership \u2014 grounded in decency, driven by purpose, and always guided by the people he served,\" and added \"Illinois is stronger because of him and the work he's championed will carry on.\"",
      "Rep. Delia Ramirez, a colleague and fellow Democrat, called Durbin a \"trusted leader, a mentor to many, and a champion for working people in Illinois.\"",
      "\"As he announces his much-deserved retirement, I am feeling thankful for his work and service to the people of Illinois and our nation,\" she wrote. \"Thank you, Senator, for the opportunity to learn from you and partner with you on so many important issues. As the proud daughter of immigrants, the spouse of a Dreamer, and the Congresswoman of IL-03, I also extend my deepest gratitude for your unwavering commitment to defending our immigrant communities.\"",

Dick Durbin has always fought the good fight on behalf of working families, and his integrity shines through in everything he does.\"",
      "With Durbin vacating his Senate seat, many prominent Democrats are expected to throw their hat in the ring. CBS News Chicago Political Analyst and former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said it's not impossible that a Republican could win the seat.",
      "\"I think that is a very remote possibility, given the nature of electorate here in Illinois, but I will sound a cautionary note. President Trump did very well not only across Illinois south of I-80, but made inroads in Cook County and DuPage County, and quite frankly did better than expected in the city of Chicago,\" she said.",
      "Lightfoot said she has no plans to run for the seat herself.",
      "\"No, I don't see that happening,\" she said. \"I can tell you private citizen Lightfoot is just fine where I am.\"",
      "Political scientist and professor Stephen Caliendo said there's more than meets the eye behind many of the statements from politicians in response to this announcement today.",
      "\"Part of what you're seeing with the praise for Senator Durbin, not to suggest at all that it's not authentic, but it's also seeking his blessing,\" he said. \"I don't know that he would come forward with a specific endorsement. Certainly not this early in a race, he wouldn't, but anybody who runs would love to have him alongside them on the campaign trail.\"",
      "Caliendo said November 2026 really isn't far away, and the race for campaign money has really already started. He believes several members of Congress from Illinois could run, with Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi holding a huge fundraising lead, with more than $18 million on hand in his campaign fund.",
      "\"He's been hoarding money for some time, and the others have been in a little bit tighter races for their seats, so they've had to spend a little bit more in recent campaigns, but he's been collecting money and certainly the suggestion would be that he was desiring a higher office,\" Caliendo said.",
      "Rep. Lauren Underwood has more than $1 million available in her campaign fund after raising nearly $400,000 between January and March, mostly from individual contributions. Rep. Robin Kelly has more than $2 million I her campaign fund, after raising more than $185,000 between January and March, also nearly all of it from individual contributions.",
      "Stratton also is considered a likely Senate candidate now that Durbin is retiring. She has less than $100,000 in her campaign fund, but can't use it for a Senate race since the money was raised for a state race, not a federal race.

    "summary": "Gang experts and researchers said that while tattoos could carry gang-related meaning, they aren't enough to prove gang membership.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has repeatedly shared an image of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos in an effort to link the Maryland man, who was mistakenly deported\u00a0to El Salvador on March 15, to the notorious MS-13 gang.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump again shared a photo of Abrego Garcia's left hand on social media, alleging he \"had 'MS-13' tattooed onto his knuckles.\" The image shows the characters \"M,\" \"S,\" \"1\" and \"3\" digitally added above Abrego Garcia's existing tattoos \u2014 a leaf, a smiley face, a cross and a skull \u2014 along with labels describing each symbol beneath.",
      "Many people online recognized the labels as digitally added, but some alleged they were designed to appear as part of Abrego Garcia's actual tattoos and accused the Trump administration of trying to mislead the public. The White House has not responded to multiple requests for comment about the image and who added the labels.",
      "The experts and researchers we spoke with acknowledged the tattoos could carry gang-related symbolism, but they said the markings alone are not reliable indicators of membership. They also cast doubt on Trump's claims that the marijuana leaf represents an \"M,\" the smiley face \"S,\" the cross \"1\" and the skull \"3.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia has no criminal record and his family says he was never involved with a gang.",
      "He was deported and sent to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison, designed to hold the most dangerous gang members, before being moved to another facility as his case attracted widespread attention. As legal efforts to bring him back to the U.S. continue, the Trump administration has cited Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos as evidence of alleged MS-13 affiliation.",
      "Roberto Lovato, an assistant professor at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, whose memoir chronicled growing up in California during MS-13's early years, said although symbols are \"notoriously difficult to interpret,\" he does not believe Abrego Garcia's tattoos are suggestive of MS-13 membership.",
      "Lovato also said current gang members he has spoken to do not believe Abrego Garcia's tattoos represent MS-13.",
      "Maya Barak, an associate professor of criminal justice studies at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, told CBS News that tattoos such as devil horns, the letters \"M\" and \"S\" and the numbers \"1\" and \"3\" have been used by MS-13 members. The National Gang Center and FBI both cited variations of \"MS,\" \"13\" and devil horns as tattoos associated with MS-13.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Sen. Dick Durbin announced Wednesday he won't seek reelection in 2026, kickstarting a race among Democrats in the Senate for his leadership position.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Dick Durbin announced Wednesday he won't seek reelection in 2026, kickstarting a race for his long-held seat representing Illinois \u2014 and a broader shakeup of Democratic leadership in the Senate.",
      "Durbin, 80, has served since 2005 as the Democratic whip, the second-ranking position in Democratic leadership. First under former Democratic leader Harry Reid and now under Chuck Schumer, the Illinois Democrat has shepherded the caucus through votes, while being a prominent voice on the leadership team for two decades.",
      "After the 2026 elections, the whip position will be up for grabs. And the announcement has spurred whispers about a possible successor.",
      "Sen. Brian Schatz's name has been floated as being among the list of Democrats who could take up the mantle. Schatz has represented Hawaii in the Senate since 2012, and currently serves as chief deputy whip. Schatz celebrated Durbin's career in a statement Wednesday, calling the Illinois Democrat a \"mentor and friend.\"",
      "Other members of the Senate Democratic leadership could also vie for the No. 2 post. The caucus elevated Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota to the No. 3 position in Senate leadership in the last internal elections, along with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey to the fourth-ranking post. Both are possible candidates for the whip role, though they each sought the Democratic nomination for the White House in 2020, and could have ambitions beyond the Senate in 2028. The caucus conducts leadership elections behind closed doors before the start of each new Congress.",
      "Durbin's retirement also opens up the coveted top Democratic spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he's been the top Democrat since 2021. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, is widely expected to take his place at the top of the panel.",
      "The Illinois Democrat's announcement of his planned departure comes months after the bruising 2024 election, where Democrats lost power in the White House and the Senate \u2014 leading some members of the party to call for a new generation of leadership to come forward. And a broader shakeup remains possible, especially as questions about Schumer's leadership have continued to swirl, though they've died down considerably in recent weeks.",
      "Facing the threat of a government shutdown in March, Schumer, who's led the caucus since 2017, delivered one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel a GOP-led funding measure to passage after he had initially pledged to oppose it. The move prompted intense frustration among his party, but Schumer has repeatedly defended his decision, arguing that a shutdown would have been worse than the funding measure for the nation, delivering sole power to the executive branch.",
      "Democrats had widely opposed the measure and expressed frustration with its spending reductions, while warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. Some progressives suggested that a shutdown was a better alternative, while others simply took issue with Schumer's changing stance. But in the end, nine Democrats and independents also voted to advance the measure, including Schumer's No. 2, Durbin \u2014 and Schatz.",
      "As attention is now turning to Senate Democratic leadership, Senate Republicans elected a new slate after the 2024 elections, tapping Sen. John Thune to lead the conference after Sen. Mitch McConnell opted to step down after 17 years at the helm.",

    "story": [
      "A 19-year-old U.S. citizen arrested by Customs and Border Protection agents earlier this month in Arizona and briefly prosecuted for illegal entry into the U.S. has intellectual disabilities, his family told CBS News.",
      "Jose Hermosillo was arrested on April 8 by CBP in Tucson and detained for 10 days. His family provided documentation proving his American citizenship, days after being taken into custody, according to court records and Department of Homeland Security assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.",
      "On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security argued his arrest, which has attracted national attention, was a \"direct result of his own actions and statements.\" A DHS spokesperson said Hermosillo approached a Border Patrol agent, said he had entered the U.S. illegally and identified himself as a Mexican citizen.",
      "The department also posted a copy of Hermosillo's sworn statement on X in which Hermosillo responded \"yes\" when asked if he had entered the U.S. illegally. The document shows a child-like signature that reads \"Jose.\"",
      "In a phone interview Tuesday, Hermosillo's parents told CBS News their son suffers from intellectual disabilities, cannot read or write and has trouble speaking. They said he could not have possibly known what he was signing when he was detained.",
      "\"He's never been able to read and was always in special education classes in school,\" Guadalupe Hermosillo, Hermosillo's mother, said in Spanish.",
      "According to his family, Hermosillo lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, but was in Tucson earlier this month visiting his girlfriend's family. He left his girlfriend's relative's home and wandered away during the night, and it was during this walk that Hermosillo was detained by CBP, his parents said.",
      "Details of the arrest remain unclear. The initial April 9 criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Arizona by a Border Patrol agent says Hermosillo was found \"at or near Nogales, Arizona without the proper immigration documents.\" The document referred to Hermosillo as an \"alien\" and charged him with \"improper entry,\" a misdemeanor offense.",
      "But DHS later stated that he was arrested in Tucson. According to court documents, Hermosillo told the judge he was a U.S. citizen during his first appearance. A day later, Hermosillo's U.S. birth certificate was made available to the judge.",
      "When CBS News spoke with Hermosillo, he appeared to be distraught and confused. He said he cried every night at the detention center, describing it as a very cold place filled with sick people who were constantly coughing.",
      "\"When I sleep, I dream that I'm still detained,\" Hermosillo said over the phone in Spanish.",
      "Representatives for DHS did not immediately respond to a CBS News request to comment on the allegations by Hermosillo and his parents, including about his intellectual disabilities.",
      "Hermosillo's mother said she was hospitalized after her son was detained because of the stress it caused.",
      "\"I cried every day,\" she said. \"I just wanted them to let him go.\"",
      "Jesus Hermosillo, Jose's father, told CBS News he received a call from an immigration official asking to confirm whether Jose was a U.S. citizen. He said he told the officials his son was born in Albuquerque.",
      "The Hermosillo family was able to locate their son at a detention center in Florence, Arizona. On April 17, a Tucson magistrate judge dismissed Hermosillo's criminal case. He was released the next day.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the court-appointed lawyer who represented Hermosillo. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said her office is looking into his case.",

    "summary": "Beginning May 7, Americans and permanent residents will only be able to pass through airport security or enter federal government buildings if they have a Real ID.",
    "story": [
      "In less than a month, Americans and permanent residents will only be able to pass through airport security or enter a federal government building if they have a Real ID. Most states are not yet fully compliant, though they've had nearly 20 years to prepare for this deadline.",
      "A CBS News data analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that at least 17 states are less than 50% compliant with the law, which goes into effect May 7. The Transportation Security Administration currently plans to treat that date as an \"all hands on deck\" day because of the looming potential for disruptions at airport checkpoints. The chart below the article lists the states and their compliance so far with the Real ID requirement.",
      "The Real ID is an enhanced ID card issued by state drivers license agencies. To obtain one, people are required to show a valid ID, as well as proof of identity, such as a passport or certified birth certificate, proof of a Social Security number and date of birth, plus two documents showing state residency, including a utility bill, credit card statement or rental agreement.",
      "So far, 30 states are less than 70% compliant. That means that in more than half the country, as many as three in every 10 travelers may not be able to pass through an airport checkpoint in just a few weeks.",
      "As of last week, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation \u2014 just 17% of its state-issued IDs are Real IDs. Pennsylvania reported 26%, while Washington and Maine tell CBS News they are at 27% compliance. New York reports 43% compliance, and California has reached nearly 55% compliance.",
      "CBS News recently traveled to a Real ID Super Center in Chicago with a line extending out the door. In Illinois, two out of three residents lack a Real ID, which prompted the state to open the downtown location in an old Walgreens, aiming to process up to 1,500 new IDs a day as it tries to catch up with surging demand.\u00a0 States mail the new IDs, however, so it can take up to two weeks to receive the new credential (a temporary paper license will not be considered a Real ID).",
      "Twelve states and the District of Columbia reported compliance rates above 90%, with seven states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wyoming and the District of Columbia \u2014 saying they're virtually 100% compliant. Texas reports 98% compliance, Mississippi 97%, Hawaii 96%, Utah 96% and Vermont 92%.",
      "TSA says it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints \u2014 meaning passengers are showing up with either a Real ID-compliant driver's license or state ID, a passport, a valid military ID, an \"enhanced\" ID issued by a handful of states or other valid identification.",
      "Earlier this month, TSA told CBS News that on May 7, when travellers show up at a TSA checkpoint with a non-compliant legacy ID, they will be subject to additional screening. TSA officers will utilize a secondary identity verification process, similar to the one used when someone's ID is stolen or lost while traveling, to verify identity. But this can be a time-consuming process, so legacy ID holders should plan to be at the airport at least three hours before departure, instead of the usual two hours for a domestic flight. If the secondary identification verification fails, the traveler will not be allowed to enter the security checkpoint or the gate area. The agency had previously indicated there would be a phased enforcement policy.",
      "\"People will experience travel delays,\" TSA spokesperson Patricia Mancha told CBS News in a recent interview at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. \"People have had years to really plan for this, so TSA will simply enforce the laws and the rules as they apply.\"",
      "The Real ID law was passed in 2005, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, to try to make state-issued identification more secure and harder to counterfeit. The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, most recently because of the pandemic. Several fully compliant states began issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009, enabling all residents to obtain a compliant ID when they renewed an existing license.",
      "\"Any new issuance of driver's license, you had to prove your identity and lawful presence back in 2009,\" said Electra Bustle, the senior director of the Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles. She says the deadline delays helped the Centennial State to be ready for the May 7 deadline. \"We have a 10-year renewal cycle before you have to get a new photograph. You can see that moving it allowed us to ensure that we're at 100% of those who are eligible to be now \u2014 to have Real IDS.\"",
      "A Real ID can be identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner of the ID. Sometimes the star appears in a circle, while California puts its star symbol inside a golden bear.",
      "Not everyone needs a Real ID. If you don't fly or enter federal government buildings, a legacy ID will continue to be valid until its expiration date.",
      "States continue to process Real ID applications, so compliance numbers will continue to change, and CBS News will update these figures before the May 7 deadline.",

    "story": [
      "The National Institutes of Health is amassing private medical records from a number of federal and commercial databases to give to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new effort to study autism, the NIH's top official said Monday.",
      "The new data will allow external researchers picked for Kennedy's autism studies to study \"comprehensive\" patient data with \"broad coverage\" of the U.S. population for the first time, NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said.",
      "\"The idea of the platform is that the existing data resources are often fragmented and difficult to obtain. The NIH itself will often pay multiple times for the same data resource. Even data resources that are within the federal government are difficult to obtain,\" he said in a presentation to the agency's advisers.",
      "Medication records from pharmacy chains, lab testing and genomics data from patients treated by the Department of Veterans Affairs and Indian Health Service, claims from private insurers and data from smartwatches and fitness trackers will all be linked together, he said.",
      "The NIH is also now in talks with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to broaden agreements governing access to their data, Bhattacharya said.",
      "In addition, a new disease registry is being launched to track Americans with autism, which will be integrated into the data. Advocacy groups and experts have called out Kennedy for describing autism as a \"preventable disease,\" which they say is stigmatizing and unfounded.",
      "Between 10 and 20 outside groups of researchers will be given grant funding and access to the records to produce Kennedy's autism studies. Bhattacharya did not give details on how they would be chosen, but said their selection would be \"run through normal NIH processes.\"",
      "Bhattacharya said the research they will back using the data will be \"the highest quality proposals\" that will range \"from basic science to epidemiological approaches, to other more applied approaches\" to treat and manage autism. He also acknowledged autism's wide variation in how it affects people.",
      "\"I recognize, of course, that autism, there's a range of manifestations ranging from highly functioning children to children that are quite severely disabled. And of course the research will account very carefully for that,\" he said.",
      "While the selected researchers will be able to access and study the private medical data, Bhattacharya said they will not be able to download it. He promised \"state of the art protections\" to protect confidentiality.",
      "By bringing the data into one place, he said it could give health agencies a window into \"real-time health monitoring\" on Americans for studying other health problems too.",
      "\"What we're proposing is a transformative real-world data initiative, which aims to provide a robust and secure computational data platform for chronic disease and autism research,\" he said.",
      "They are planning a \"rapid timeline\" to launch the autism research using this data, he said, but did not give specifics on when it would start or how long the studies would take. Kennedy last week appeared to walk back his earlier prediction that they would have all the answers to autism's causes by September.",
      "Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, Bhattacharya pushed back the timeline, saying that they now hope to have grants going out the door by September for the research.",

    "summary": "A Maryland school board decided to end parental opt-outs for instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation, sparking the dispute that's before the Supreme Court.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A sharply divided Supreme Court appeared likely to require a Maryland school board provide parents with the ability to opt their elementary school-age children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "At issue in the court fight between a group of families and the Montgomery County Board of Education is whether public schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to exercise their religion freely when they require children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality that violate the families' religious beliefs.",
      "After more than two hours of arguments, the court's conservative majority seemed ready to side with the families.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who lives in Montgomery County, Maryland, invoked the state's founding and said the county in particular has been a \"beacon\" of religious liberty and tolerance. He told Alan Schoenfeld, who argued for the school board, he was \"surprised\" given that history that \"this is the hill we're going to die on in terms of not respecting religious liberty.\"",
      "\"What is the big deal about allowing them to opt-out of this?\" Justice Samuel Alito asked, noting that the county allows parents to request their children be excused from other areas of instruction, such as sexual education or Halloween or Valentine's Day celebrations. \"What is infeasible about doing that?\"",
      "Kavanaugh echoed Alito, saying, \"I'm not understanding why it's not feasible\" for schools to excuse children from instruction that violate their families' religious beliefs.",
      "Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia allow for parental opt-outs or require opt-ins before students participate in sex education. Montgomery County, home to Maryland's largest public school system with more than 160,000 students, also had an opt-out policy for parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities so long as the requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court papers.",
      "After Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity,\" the Montgomery County Education Board introduced \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks for elementary school students into its English Language Arts curriculum. The district said it supplemented its language arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" Among the five books incorporated, which are at issue in the case, were \"Born Ready,\" about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" about a prince who falls in with and marries a knight.",
      "Several of the justices acknowledged that they had read the picture books that were included in the curriculum, and Alito at one point even read from one, \"Uncle Bobby's Wedding,\" which discusses gay marriage.",
      "The board adopted the lessons in 2022, but allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction involving the storybooks. But in March 2023, the Montgomery County school board announced that families would no longer receive advanced notice of when the books would be read and would not be able to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "The board said in court filings that the opt-outs had become \"unworkable,\" as some schools had high numbers of absences, and all faced \"substantial hurdles\" in using the books while honoring opt-out requests, as teachers would have to manage the removal of excused students from class and plan alternative activities for them.",
      "That decision, however, sparked backlash within the community \u2014 more than 1,000 parents signed a petition that called on the board to restore the notice and opt-outs, and dozens protested the books at board meetings as violating their religious beliefs. The school board then revised its Religious Diversity Guidelines to limit the circumstances when students can be excused to noncurricular activities or free-time events that conflict with their family's religious practices.",
      "A group of three families filed a lawsuit against the Montgomery County Board of Education, arguing that denial of the notice and opt-outs violated their right to exercise their religion freely under the First Amendment because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children. The families \u2014 who are Muslim, Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox\u00a0 \u2014 sought a preliminary injunction that would've required the school board to provide advance notice and the chance to opt their children out of instruction that involved the books.",
      "But a federal district judge in Maryland denied the request, finding that the no-opt-out policy did not burden the families' religious exercise. The parents' inability to excuse their children from instruction with the storybooks doesn't coerce them into violating their religious beliefs, the court found, as they can still teach their kids about their convictions regarding sexuality, marriage and gender.",
      "A divided panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit also found that there was no burden on the families' free exercise of religion because there was no evidence they were compelled to change their religious beliefs or conduct.",
      "The families asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, and the high court in January agreed to do so. The Trump administration is backing the parents in the case, arguing that the board burdened parents' religious exercise by forcing them to choose between violating their religious beliefs or forgoing public education.",
      "In filings\u00a0with the high court, lawyers for the parents also said that Montgomery County is presenting them with an \"impossible\" choice.",
      "The parents, they said, \"must subject their children to instruction intended to disrupt their religious beliefs or forgo the benefits of a public education at the sizeable cost of either paying for private school, homeschooling, or facing government fines and penalties.\"",
      "Additionally, they argued that suspending the notice and opt-outs created \"topsy-turvy categorizations\" in which a 14-year-old can be excused from instruction on gender and sexuality during sex education, but a 4-year-old has to sit through similar instruction as part of the English Language Arts curriculum.",
      "Eric Baxter, who argued on behalf of the families, told the justices that Montgomery County is an \"extreme outlier\" for declining to allow parents to excuse their children despite their religious objections to the content. He said the instruction featuring the books with LGBTQ-themes was \"clearly indoctrinating\" students.",
      "The families also said that at least one member of the board demonstrated religious hostility toward them, claiming they likened them to \"white supremacists\" and \"xenophobes.\"",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly raised the comments, and asked Shoenfeld if they \"suggest a hostility toward religion.\"",
      "Shoenfeld said the remarks were taken out of context but acknowledged they were \"intemperate.\"",
      "Kavanaugh said that as a lifelong resident of Montgomery County, he was \"mystified\" by what led the county to eventually end the opt-outs, and said it \"stands alone\" both with the types of books added to the curriculum for young students and in not allowing parents to opt their children out of the instruction.",
      "The school system has said that its teachers were expressly forbidden from using the books to pressure students to change their religious beliefs, and argued that while it tried to accommodate parents' requests to opt their children out of the instruction, doing so eventually became \"unworkably disruptive.\"",
      "Lawyers for the school district also argued that exposure to content that parents object to on religious grounds is not the same as impermissibly coercing students to disavow their religious practices.",
      "The parents, they said, didn't put forward any evidence that their children were penalized for their religious beliefs, were asked to affirm views contrary to their faith, or were prohibited from engaging in religious practice. Schoenfeld told the justices that the books sought to \"foster mutual respect in a pluralistic community.\"",
      "It was unclear whether the court would adopt a firm rule that specifies when certain public-school instruction crosses the line from mere exposure to objectionable content into impermissible coercion of students. The justices raised several examples to discern the point at which the right to free exercise of religion would be burdened.",

    "summary": "Shortening permitting procedures for mining and oil drilling could adversely affect the environment, communities and endangered species, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it will accelerate permit approvals for mining, drilling and fossil fuel production and transportation on public land, fast-tracking a review process that would normally take years.",
      "In announcing the emergency procedures Wednesday, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the management of federal lands and natural resources, said the permitting process will now take up to \"28 days at most\" \u2014 a drastic departure from the current one- to two-year timeline.",
      "The government agency said the move is in response to President Trump's January 20 declaration of a national energy emergency. In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail. The new guidelines will apply to a wide range of energy projects, including crude oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The U.S. leads the world in\u00a0oil\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0production, with an output of 20 million barrels of oil a day and accounting for roughly a quarter of global gas production, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "The DOI said it would use emergency authorities under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to expedite the permitting process.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to wait,\" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \"President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security, and these emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.\"",
      "Lawsuits to come, experts say",
      "Environmental advocates rebuked the announcement, saying that in addition to adverse environmental impacts on public land and water sources, the expedited procedures will strip away community members' ability to weigh in on projects happening in their own backyards. Experts say the move is expected to draw legal challenges.",
      "\"What they're proposing to do is basically forgo environmental review or public participation or anything meaningful,\" said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. \"The implications of that are extreme.\"",
      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Section 7 of the Act requires consultation among agencies \"to ensure their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of federally protected species, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",
      "A win for oil and gas industries",
      "The announcement on Wednesday was a win for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, which has\u00a0cheered\u00a0Mr. Trump's energy agenda.",
      "\"Our nation's permitting system is broken, and reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy,\" Holly Hopkins, VP of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Former officials from several different federal agencies who served under Mr. Trump's previous term and the Biden administration have told CBS News on background that looming workforce reductions could throw a wrench in the department's plans to speed up the permitting process. Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon. An internal White House document obtained by The Washington Post indicated that as many as 1 in 4 department employees could be let go as a part of a broader series of staff cuts across government agencies.",
      "\"How can you accomplish so much with fewer and fewer people?\" said Burger of Columbia's Sabin Center. \"The only result is less and less oversight.\"",
      "Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, agreed, adding that gutting the federal agency could hinder the Trump administration's objectives.",
      "\"They just don't seem to understand that these employees run the gamut from wildlife biologists to firefighters, to people who permit oil and gas drilling or permit mines on federal lands,\" he said. \"If it's going to wholesale cut staff, some of the things they care about are going to get caught up in that.\"",
      "The Department of Interior did not respond to request for comment on how layoffs might impact its ability to issue permits on a tighter timetable.",
      "According to the new procedural guidelines issued by the agency this week, companies seeking a permit are required to confirm in writing that they want their project covered by the expedited process \u2014 meaning that not everyone will necessarily opt in. Those that do could stand to lose big, Manuel said.",
      "\"Companies are very cautious before they sink millions of dollars into a well or to a mining project,\" he said. \"So I think they benefit from going slowly because they don't want to be stuck with a stranded asset or literally drill a dry hole here.\"",

      "The insect is only found on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It creeps along spiderwebs, feeding on trapped insects and adorning its silk case with their body parts.",
      "In findings,\u00a0published Thursday in the journal Science, researchers said the caterpillar \"boasts an unprecedented and macabre practice of decorating its portable larval home with the body parts of the spider prey it harvests from the web where it resides.\"",
      "There are other meat-eating caterpillars that \"do lots of crazy things, but this takes the cake,\" said study author Dan Rubinoff with the University of Hawaii at Manoa.",
      "Scientists think the case might act as camouflage, allowing the caterpillar to feast on the spider's ensnared meals without getting caught.",
      "The \"Bone Collector\" was the name of Jeffery Deaver's 1997 crime novel and subsequent 1999 movie starring Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie.",
      "\"I think the term is out there in the ether, and just fit with what these caterpillars are doing. It's a bit tongue in cheek because arthropods don't actually have bones,\" Rubinoff told\u00a0the Reuters news agency.",
      "A host of caterpillars native to Hawaii use silk glands to spin protective cases studded with lichen, sand and other materials. This one is the first to use ant heads and fly wings.",
      "\"It really is an astonishing type of case,\" said Steven Montgomery, an entomology consultant in Hawaii who was not involved with the new study.",
      "Scientists found just 62 of the carnivorous caterpillars in over 20 years of observing.",
      "Predatory caterpillars are extremely rare and the bone collectors found in Hawaii will even eat each other, researchers said.",
      "The bone collector's origins date back at least 6 million years, making the caterpillars more than one million years older than the Hawaiian islands themselves. Today, they dwell on an isolated patch of mountain forest alongside invasive species.",
      "The spider \"is restricted to 15 square kilometers of a single mountain range on the island of O\u02bbahu, meaning that other members of the lineage have disappeared from older islands,\" the scientists wrote.",
      "Scientists urged conservation efforts to save the unique lineage.",

      "Pettit, Soyuz MS-26/72S commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Ivan Vagner undocked from the Russian Rassvet module at 5:57 p.m. EDT, setting up a parachute-assisted landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan near the town of Dzhezkazgan at 9:20 p.m. EDT \u2014 6:20 a.m. local time Sunday, Pettit's birthday, at the landing site.",
      "Russian recovery crews and NASA personnel rushed to the spacecraft, opened the top hatch and helped carry the returning crew members to nearby recliners where flight surgeons carried out initial health checks.",
      "Ovchinin and Vagner appeared to be in good spirits, smiling, chatting with support crews and enjoying drinks and snacks. Pettit, however, looked disoriented as he was carried from the descent module, letting his head fall back and closing his eyes as he was moved to his recliner. He was not seen again on the landing site video.",
      "But there were no indications of any sort of major problem, medical or otherwise. From Kazakhstan, Ovchinin and Vagner will head back to Star City near Moscow, while Pettit will be flown to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for more detailed tests and the start of physical re-habilitation.",
      "In an April 16 interview with KOIN-TV in Portland, Oregon, Pettit said he had more difficulty than most when returning to gravity after a long stay in space.",
      "\"The very first thing I'm going to do when I get to Earth will probably be to empty the contents of my stomach,\" he said, prompting laughter. \"It's a physiological thing, it affects different people different ways. Some people can land and go out and eat pizza and dance. When I land, it takes me about 24 hours to feel like I'm a human being again.\"",
      "With the on-time landing, mission duration stood at 220 days and nearly nine hours, spanning 3,520 orbits and 93.3 million miles since launch last Sept. 11 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Ovchinin has now logged 595 days in space over four flights, followed closely by Pettit, whose total stands at 590 days over four flights of his own. Vagner's total after two station visits stands at 416 days.",
      "The world record for most cumulative time in space is held by cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who spent nearly 1,111 days in orbit over five missions. The U.S. record is held by astronaut Peggy Whitson. She spent 675 days in space over four flights.",
      "As for Pettit's age, John Glenn, the first American in orbit, was 77 when he flew aboard the space shuttle in 1998 as a NASA spaceflight participant. He holds the record as the oldest person to fly in orbit.",
      "The Soyuz crew's return to Earth marked the final chapter in an extended crew rotation that began with launch of SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov on March 14.",
      "Crew 10's arrival at the station cleared the way for Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams to return to Earth four days later.",

      "In a brief ceremony Friday, Ovchinin turned command of the station over to Onishi.",
      "\"It's a great honor for me to accept the command of the ISS,\" Onishi said. \"I feel so special that I am taking over the command from you because it's been almost nine years since we met here in 2016 during Expedition 48. At that time, both of us were rookies and here we are two veterans who are ISS commanders.\"",
      "\"Human space flight is not easy. Only continuous dedication from generation to generation made it possible for human beings to get here. Now today, we have four rookies (on board). I'm sure one day they will come back and become commanders ... that's how we will continue to develop human space flight,\" Onishi said.",
      "The ISS has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since Nov. 2, 2000. Scheduled for retirement in five years, the lab is facing problems on multiple fronts, ranging from air leaks in the Russian segment to uncertain funding, spare parts shortages and resupply delays.",
      "\"Spaceflight is difficult and very risky,\" Rich Williams, a member of NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, told the group in a public meeting Thursday. \"The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence.\"",
      "\"The ISS management, crew and support personnel always make spaceflight look easy. Spaceflight is anything but easy, and the increasing risks attending the ISS program are making it harder,\" Williams said.",
      "The air leaks in the Zvezda module's aft docking compartment are presumably the results of metal fatigue and repeated pressure cycles as visiting Soyuz crew ships and Progress cargo freighters come and go.",
      "\"Primary risk mitigation activities at this point include application and patching materials to known cracks and limiting ... pressurization cycles to try to limit stress and fatigue,\" Williams said. \"The ISS program is monitoring this closely, and the panel considers this one of our highest concerns.\"",
      "NASA has hired SpaceX to build a U.S. deorbit vehicle, or USDV, to drive the million-pound space station back into the atmosphere in 2030 to ensure it breaks up over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from shipping lanes and populated areas. The USDV is expected to arrive at the lab in 2029.",
      "\"Delivering and utilizing this USDV capability is critical to ensuring that the deorbit debris risk meets the established government public safety standards,\" Williams said. \"If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude.\"",
      "He said NASA and Russian space officials are working \"to address the challenges associated with achieving a safe deorbit capability, both for end-of-life as well as a risk-managed deorbit for contingencies.\"",
      "The major problem facing the ISS is what Williams called \"a large ISS budget shortfall.\" NASA's fiscal 2024 budget included nearly $1 billion for station operations and maintenance with another $1.6 billion earmarked for crew launches and resupply missions.",
      "\"It is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle has safely re-entered, not only to assure safety of day-to-day operations in a high-risk environment, but also to ensure controlled, safe deorbit within debris footprint requirements for the sake of public safety,\" Williams said.",
      "In summary, he said, \"the panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risks attending the program over the next several years.\"",

    "summary": "Companies say fake job seekers are using artificial intelligence to get remote jobs, often in an attempt to steal insider secrets.",
    "story": [
      "Scammers are using artificial intelligence to alter their appearance and build fake profiles to apply for remote job postings, research shows.",
      "Already, scammers can use AI at almost every step in the job application process to hide their true identities. They can generate fake resumes, professional headshots, websites and Linkedin profiles. Compiled together, AI can help create what looks like the perfect candidate for an open role.",
      "Once they're in, these fraudsters can steal company secrets or install malware.",
      "While identity theft is not new, AI is helping scammers scale their operations, and the problem is growing. According to research and advisory firm Gartner,\u00a0an estimated one in four job applicants will be fake by 2028.",
      "How to spot a fake",
      "A recording of an interview with what appeared to be an AI-generated job seeker went viral on LinkedIn, posted by Dawid Moczadlo, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Vidoc Security. He told CBS News he was shocked when he realized what was happening.",
      "\"I felt a little bit violated, because we are the security experts,\" Moczadlo said.",
      "Moczadlo said when he suspected the person was using an AI filter, he asked a simple question: \"Can you take your hand and put it in front of your face?\"",
      "When they refused, Moczadlo immediately ended the interview. He explained that the software the scammer was using didn't seem sophisticated, so blocking the person's face with their hand would likely \"break\" the deepfake face filter.",
      "\"Sometimes it takes a hacker to find a hacker,\" Moczadlo said.",
      "This was the second time the company had interviewed someone who turned out to be AI-generated. Moczadlo said it completely changed the company's hiring process. Now, potential employees are flown in for a one-day, in-person interview. The company covers travel and pays for a full day of work. It believes the extra cost is worth the peace of mind.",
      "A pattern of deception",
      "These incidents aren't isolated. The Justice Department has uncovered multiple networks in which North Koreans used fake identities to land remote jobs in the U.S. They often use AI to build fake identities and work U.S.-based IT jobs to funnel U.S. dollars to their home country.",
      "The Justice Department estimates these schemes generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually, with much of those funds going directly to the North Korean Ministry of Defense and the country's nuclear missile program.",
      "Moczadlo said researchers told him Vidoc's fake job seekers followed a similar pattern to several of these North Korean networks, though Vidoc's incident is still under investigation.",
      "\"We are really lucky that we are security experts.\" Moczadlo added, \"but for companies that have regular people like hiring managers or regular startup founders, it's really hard for them to spot something like this.\"",
      "The reaction inspired Vidoc's co-founders to build a guide to help HR professionals across industries spot potentially fraudulent applicants.",
      "If you're wondering if this has ever happened to you, the CBS News Confirmed team has compiled some general best-practices to check that the person you're speaking to is real:",
      "1. Look closer at their LinkedIn profile: While the profile might look legitimate at first glance, check the creation date by clicking on the \"More\" button and then selecting \"About this profile.\" You can also check that the person has connections at the places they say they've worked.",
      "2. Ask cultural questions: If someone says they grew up in a specific country or city, ask about things only a local might know, like their favorite cafes and restaurants.",
      "3. In-person is best: At the end of the day, especially as AI technology advances, the only way to really know that a person is who they say they are, is to meet them face-to-face.",

    "summary": "The EU has hit Apple and Meta with hundreds of millions of euros in fines as it steps up enforcement of the European Union's Digital Markets Act.",
    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc's digital competition rules. The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \"periodic penalty payments,\" the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It's a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do's and don'ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \"gatekeepers\" from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \"that citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\" Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",
      "\"The decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,\" Virkkunen said.",
      "Both companies indicated they would appeal.",
      "\"The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,\" Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement provided by the U.S. tech giant. \"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\"",
      "Apple accused the commission of \"unfairly targeting\" the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\" despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA's provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \"non-compliant\" conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \"spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\"Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "Apple has also faced a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., where the\u00a0Justice Department alleged\u00a0that the California company illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a \"moat around its smartphone monopoly\" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.",
      "The EU's Meta investigation centered on the company's strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union's top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta's model, saying it doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \"freely consent\" to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also include Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \"currently assessing\" this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",
      "The European Commission has also\u00a0slapped Google with antitrust penalties several times, including a record $5 billion fine levied in 2018 over the search engine's abuse of the market dominance of its Android mobile phone operating system.",

    "summary": "U.S. Department of Justice attorneys are seeking to impose sweeping penalties on Google after a court ruled the tech giant is a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "A hearing kicked off today in Washington, D.C., that could determine whether Google remains in its current form, or if it could face penalties such as selling off its popular Chrome web browser.",
      "The so-called remedy hearing is the consequence of a court ruling last August that found Google is operating a monopoly and uses its dominant market position to crush rivals and put a lid on innovation.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is arguing that Google should be forced to divest its Chrome browser, which the agency describes as \"one of the largest entry points that exists for searches.\" By selling Chrome, rivals could have a chance to compete for search queries, the government argues, but such a change would drastically reshape Google's parent, Alphabet, a tech giant with a $1.8 trillion market valuation.",
      "\"Google can compete, but they simply don't want to compete on a level playing field,\" Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist said on Monday during his opening before the court. \"Google is now fearful of competing against rivals who will only get stronger with the proposed remedies in place.\"",
      "The hearing comes just days after Google was branded an abusive monopolist in a separate case that ruled the tech giant had illegally exploited some of its online marketing technology to boost profits. The more recent case focused on Google's online advertising business, which has been built around its search engine and other widely used products, including Chrome and YouTube.",
      "Here's what to know about the current remedy hearing.",
      "What is the Google hearing about?",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that Google has illegally exploited its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.",
      "The current hearing is aimed at addressing potential remedies, with Mehta expected to issue a decision by August 2025, according to a November research note from Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan.",
      "\"We are not here to relitigate the case, we are here to ask the court to fix the harm from Google's unlawful conduct,\" said Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater in a Monday statement before the hearing's opening arguments.",
      "What does the Justice Department want?",
      "The Justice Department is pushing for several changes, Dahlquist said on Monday during the trial.",
      "They include:",
      "Forcing Google to divest the Chrome browser;Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Forcing Google to divest the Chrome browser;",
      "Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;",
      "Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Some of the changes sought by the DOJ would last for years, with Sheridan noting that the requirements would \"include Google enabling ongoing access to its search index, making available user and ads search data (for up to 10 years), syndicating its search text ads data for up to 1 year and syndicating its search results, ranking signals & query understanding information (for queries originated in the U.S.) for up to 10 years.\"",
      "What would happen to Chrome?",
      "Jon Sallet, representing a group of states that joined the Justice Department in the case, said in his opening statements that his first priority is the divestiture of Chrome.",
      "Chrome is a \"massively attractive asset\" with over 4.1 billion global users, he added. \"This kind of asset doesn't come up very often.\"",
      "Divestitures can happen in a number of ways, such as a spinoff or sale of a business unit. In some cases, the existing shareholders of a company \u2014 in this case, Google parent Alphabet \u2014 receive new shares in the divested business.",
      "AT&T may be one of the best-known companies to have been broken apart after being accused of operating a monopoly. The phone giant split into several smaller companies as part of a 1982 settlement with the U.S. government, leading to the creation of several smaller regional phone operators, such as Bell South and Bell Atlantic.",
      "Splitting off Chrome would likely deliver a financial hit to Google's revenue, Goldman's Sheridan added. It would not only limit Google Search revenue, but would also restrict search query volume and access to user data, he noted.",
      "What is Google's response to the DOJ?",
      "Google attacked the government's proposed antitrust remedies, with its lead attorney, John Schmidtlein, calling them \"fundamentally flawed\" and arguing that they would unfairly penalize the company for its innovation.",
      "\"Google earned its market position through hard work and ingenuity,\" Schmidtlein said.",
      "A divestiture of Chrome would be \"far from simple,\" he said, noting that the remedy would go beyond the browser to include the open-source Chromium project Google created and has supported for years.",
      "\"The decree demands not only Chrome but also everything critical to Chromium's functionality,\" Schmidtlein said. \"What does that even mean? They're leaving it up to a technical committee, but there's no clarity on what constitutes necessary assets.\"",
      "He criticized the process, saying it lacks a clear path for evaluating potential buyers, and warned that Google would effectively be barred from the browser market for 10 years. \"I can't think of an antitrust remedy that approaches this,\" he added.",

      "Since the second week in April, sellers on Amazon have raised their prices on nearly 1,000 products, according to data from SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike \u2014 nearly 30%.",
      "Costs rose on a wide range of items, from tech accessories such as phone charges to women's clothing, SmartScout founder and CEO Scott Needham told CBS MoneyWatch. Anker, a top-selling brand on Amazon that sells mobile charging devices, has increased prices on roughly 25% of its products on the site, for example.",
      "\"It's one of first concerted efforts I've seen where nothing explains the price hikes other than tariffs,\" Needham said.",
      "Tariffs are paid by importers, and they typically pass on much or even all of those additional costs to consumers. Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy told CNBC\u00a0earlier this month that he expected U.S. tariffs to boost prices on a host of consumer goods.",
      "The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports, while China has retaliated with levies of 125% on U.S. goods entering the country. Mr. Trump has long accused China of unfair trade practices, saying that tariffs will reinvigorate the domestic manufacturing sector and spur economic growth.",
      "Shein, Temu prices also rising",
      "Other major e-commerce players and retailers have also lifted prices to offset higher import costs, sometime by adding \"tariff surcharges\" to customers' bills. Chinese e-commerce sites Shein and Temu each announced\u00a0last week that they would hike prices after the U.S. closed a loophole that had allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.",
      "Those price hikes took effect today. On Temu's site, a pair of running sneakers that last week cost $14 now runs about $27.",
      "The jump illustrates retailers' struggles to navigate President Trump's tariff agenda. Sky-high tariffs can make manufacturing goods in countries like China uneconomical. But revamping supply chains or moving manufacturing to another country can take years and cost hundreds of millions or even billions dollars, experts say.",
      "Uncertainty over tariff rates and how long such levies could remain in place is also making it difficult for companies to plan.",
      "Mr. Trump said this week that the U.S. and China were actively negotiating over how to resolve their trade differences and that he expected tariffs on Chinese imports to fall \"substantially.\" But officials in Beijing quickly\u00a0denied the sides were in talks, and instead reiterated its demand that the U.S. revoke its tariffs against the nation.",

Its lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., accuses Mr. Trump and other members of his administration of overreaching the president's authority in imposing the broad-based import duties.

      "For now, Woldenberg said he's focused on figuring out how to shift manufacturing out of China, where about 60% of his products are produced. Goods imported from that nation are now facing U.S. tariffs of 145%.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by the companies that import the products, Woldenberg's business \u2014 not China \u2014 is on the hook for paying for Mr. Trump's high import duties.",
      "One question facing Woldenberg is whether he can shift production out of China fast enough to keep ahead of Mr. Trump's tariffs. In recent years, Learning Resources has added factories in India and Vietnam, but that effort has only moved the needle so far, he said.",
      "\"In a two- or three-year period we moved 16% of our product from China to those markets and got things going,\" Woldenberg said. \"That took a lot of effort, cost us a couple million dollars, at least, in out-of-pocket expenses to move it from Point A to Point B, and a huge amount of man hours on our side to essentially redevelop all those products.\"",
      "Despite that effort, however, the company has to date moved only about 16% of its manufacturing capacity out of China to other countries, Woldenberg said.",
      "Reshoring realities",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that tariffs will revive the domestic manufacturing sector because the costs of the import taxes will spur both American and foreign businesses to reshore their factories to the U.S. But economists \u2014 and Woldenberg \u2014 are skeptical, pointing out that such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories.",
      "\"The fact that [Mr. Trump] believes in it is something that I think is irrelevant \u2014 there are people that believe in ghosts, OK?\" Woldenberg said.",
      "Learning Resources' financial resources aren't deep enough to build its own factory, Woldenberg said. He noted that he's also tried to find plants in the U.S. that could make some of his products because he believed toys with a \"Made in USA\" label could appeal to some customers.",
      "\"If we had six to 10 products that were made in America, we could go and say, 'Look! Made in America. You want made in America? Here's Made in America,\" he said. \"We can't even find somebody to make six or 10 products.\"",
      "The reason, he said, is U.S. manufacturers don't have the capability to make the types of products he's selling, while the costs of manufacturing them himself would be prohibitive. \"I cannot produce a factory that can produce our product at a competitive price,\" Woldenberg said.",
      "To be sure, some businesses have announced plans to build new U.S. plants or hire more workers in recent months. They include tech giant Apple, which in February\u00a0said\u00a0that it's committed to spending more than $500 billion on expanding its U.S. manufacturing capabilities over four years.",
      "But Apple \"is in a different stratosphere than me,\" Woldenberg noted. \"They also have like a dozen products. We have 2,000.\"",
      "Skittish workers",
      "Meantime, Woldenberg said he's committed to keeping his 500 workers employed, likening the current challenges to those his business faced during the pandemic. Now, as then, his employees are worried about the impact of Mr. Trump's trade war and whether their jobs might be at risk, he said.",
      "\"Two days before we were kicked out of our office in March of 2020, I had an all-company meeting and I said, 'We define this as a community problem ... the goal is to get everybody across the river.' And we did that,\" he said. \"No one lost an hour of pay.\"",
      "Woldenberg added, \"I have a very strong commitment to getting them through this, and it's unwavering, and I'll do everything that I can.\"",
      "Even so, Woldenberg wants to see the Trump administration drop their tariff plans.",
      "\"They should go back to the way things were on January 19th and figure out another plan. This one is not working,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Avelo Airlines says it's counting on a new federal contract for deportation flights to help the discount carrier grow its regular passenger service.",
    "story": [
      "Avelo Airlines is targeting a new passenger segment: migrants being sent to detention centers across the U.S. The budget carrier will also use its planes to fly migrants out of the country under the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.",
      "Avelo has signed a contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to handle deportation flights for U.S. Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE), the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Avelo, which launched in 2021, said the move is necessary for the Houston-based airline to remain financially stable.",
      "\"We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy said in a statement to CBS News earlier this month after the company struck a deal with ICE. \"After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.\"",
      "The domestic and international flights ferrying migrants will begin May 14 out of a new hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where Avelo will station three Boeing 737-800 planes to handle the transports. Unlike the company's regular commercial flights, the aircraft used for the trips will not bear Avelo's logo, the company said.",
      "Avelo described the agreement with ICE as a \"long-term charter program.\" The exact terms of the deal were not made public.",
      "The airline is now recruiting flight attendants to staff the flights, according to a\u00a0job posting\u00a0for what it calls a \"charter program for the Department of Homeland Security.\" The job pays $28 an hour for the first year of service.",
      "\"We are seeking energetic, highly motivated Flight Attendants who wish to join a committed group of safety and service professionals at Avelo Airlines,\" the listing reads.",
      "\"Flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS's deportation efforts,\" the post adds, although it makes no references to migrants.",
      "Avelo offers flights across the U.S. and to international destinations including the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico. It operates out of eight hubs across the U.S., flying out of the following airports: Concord-Padgett Regional Airport in North Carolina; Hollywood Burbank Airport in California; Lakeland International Airport in Florida; Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina; Sonoma County Airport in California; Tweed-New Haven airport in Connecticut; Wilmington Airport in New Hampshire; and Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina.",
      "The company previously operated charter flights as Casino Express Airlines before rebranding as Avelo in 2021, according to S&P Capital IQ.",
      "Avelo declined to comment further on its contract with the government. DHS confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch that Avelo is contracting with ICE to assist with deportation flights.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has long contracted with CSI Aviation, an aviation broker that provides private air charter services, medical flights for patients in emergencies and government flight services. Under its new contract with ICE, Avelo will operate as a sub-carrier of CSI.",
      "DHS also subcontracts with other air charter companies, which provide planes and operate the flights. One such charter outfit is GlobalX. It handles roughly 70% of DHS' flights, according to immigrant advocate Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an activist group monitoring ICE operations.",
      "GlobalX did not reply to a request for comment on its work with DHS.",
      "Cartwright, who tracks ICE flights through publicly available sources, expressed surprise at Avelo agreeing to shuttle migrants destined for detention centers or deportation.",
      "\"I have never seen a retail airline that sells to consumers being used in this way,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Typically, charter companies that don't fly retail-type flights. They are not selling tickets directly to consumers.\"",
      "According to data on USAspending.gov, a U.S. government website that tracks federal spending, DHS' roughly 6-month contract this year with CSI Aviation is worth at least $78.1 million. Its value could rise to as much as $162.2 million.",
      "The purpose of the agreement, the site states, \"is to provide daily scheduled large aircraft & special high risk charter flights to facilitate ICE's enforcement and removal of operations of illegal aliens.\"",
      "CSI Aviation did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on its contract with the federal government.",
      "Cruising for revenue",
      "Airline industry experts said charter outfits like CSI typically aren't familiar to the general public.",
      "\"Nobody has usually ever heard of the airlines,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals site, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are charter airlines that don't have a set schedule on a website,\" he said.",
      "However, an upstart airline hunting for additional revenue streams outside of selling tickets to members of the flying public is not unusual.",
      "\"It's very difficult to compete with the Deltas and Uniteds of the world, so they try any number of tactics,\" Keyes explained. \"They fly to and from smaller cities, they offer bargain-basement prices. There are all different types of counter-positioning things they do.\"",
      "But Avelo's move is more surprising because most commercial airlines don't have enough spare aircraft and crew for specialized operations like migrant flights, noted Seth Miller, founder and editor in chief of PaxEx Aero, an aviation consulting service. Miller said he opposes Avelo working with U.S. immigration authorities on ethical grounds.",
      "Avelo's contract with DHS is also drawing criticism from an immigrant advocacy group. A petition started by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition urging people to boycott Avelo until it severs ties with ICE has collected more than 34,650 signatures.",
      "\"We reject the Trump Administration's inhumane deportation practices, reject cooperation from the State of Connecticut in support of Avelo as long as they are complicit in these practices and pledge to boycott Avelo as long as they are profiting from ICE flights,\" the petition states.",
      "Although federal contracts can provide steady business for airlines and charter carriers, Avelo's partnership with DHS poses a reputational risk, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I still think it's morally questionable to run these charters for the federal government and think it poses a very real reputational risk for Avelo,\" Miller said, citing protests against the airline at some of Avelo's hubs.",
      "Will Humphries, a traveler at Sonoma County Airport, in Santa Rosa, California, where Avelo operates, is among those members of the flying public who plan to boycott Avelo because of its work with ICE.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 15:18:18 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said that a baby bonus provided to new parents could be a \"good idea.\" Here's how it's worked in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are having fewer babies, with the annual birth rate now standing near a record low. It's a trend that has implications for the nation's long-term outlook \u2014 and has drawn attention from the Trump administration, with the New York Times reporting that a proposal for a $5,000 \"baby bonus\" may be one option for juicing the birth rate.",
      "\"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" President Trump said on Tuesday at a White House event when asked about the possibility of a federal baby bonus.",
      "Yet the idea may be far from becoming a reality, with a White House official telling CBS MoneyWatch that no final decision on such a plan has been made.",
      "A declining birth rate can spell long-term economic problems, including a shrinking labor force that's financially strapped to pay for medical services and retirement benefits for an aging population. But reversing a nation's declining birth rate could take far more than a one-time payment that, for most parents, would be quickly consumed by the costs of diapers, child care and other essentials.",
      "Other countries with similar demographic trends have tried an array of strategies to revive their birth rates, but in most cases with short-lived results or no impact at all.",
      "Some experts point out that by tackling long-standing economic issues \u2014 such as providing affordable day care and paid parental leave after the birth of a child \u2014 the government could provide a more hospitable environment for families. The U.S. is one of a only a handful of nations that doesn't provide paid leave for parents, including countries such as Papua New Guinea and Suriname.",
      "\"President Trump is proudly implementing policies to uplift American families, from securing order [at the] border to keep violent criminals out of our communities, to lowering taxes and the cost of living,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in an email in response to a question about the baby bonus idea. \"The President wants America to be a country where all children can safely grow up and achieve the American dream.\"",
      "Here's what to know about baby bonuses.",
      "How much has the U.S. birth rate declined?",
      "About 3.6 million babies were born in the U.S. last year, according to the most recent CDC data. That's little changed from the prior year, when the number of births hit a new record low.",
      "The fertility rate, or the average number of children born to each woman in the U.S., dropped to about 1.6 in 2023, down from 3.7 in 1960, when the nation was in the midst of the post-war baby boom, according to data from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "What's causing the decline?",
      "That's unclear from an economic or policy standpoint, according to economists Melissa Kearney of University of Maryland, Philip Levine of Wellesley College and Luke Pardue of the Aspen Economic Strategy Group, the authors of a 2022\u00a0analysis of the birth rate decline in the economics publication Econofact.",
      "But, they added, \"Shifting priorities could be the primary driver for the decline in the birth rate since 2007.\"",
      "Survey and anecdotal data suggests that \"young adults have different preferences for having children, aspirations for life and views about parenting norms that are driving the decline in the U.S. birth rates,\" they wrote.",
      "Could financial incentives increase the birth rate?",
      "Other countries that have tried similar monetary incentives have had mixed success.",
      "Australia introduced a baby bonus in 2004, providing $3,000 Australian dollars to parents for each birth, an amount that was eventually hiked to A$5,000.",
      "After an initial bump in births when the policy was introduced, Australia's birth rate has continued to decline, dropping from about 2 children on average for each woman to about 1.5 in 2023, below the U.S. rate, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.",
      "Likewise, Hungary has introduced a number of incentives to convince its citizens to have more children, from providing baby grants to tax breaks for families with three or more children. Its birth rate increased slightly in the 2010s after hitting a record low of about 1.2 in 2011.",
      "But after rising to 1.6 in 2021, Hungary's birth rate is once again dropping, demographic data shows.",
      "\"Baby bonuses have not worked for Hungary. Why would we replicate this here in [the U.S.]?\" wrote Gabriella Hoffman, the director of the Center for Energy and Conservation at Independent Women's Forum, in a social media post.",
      "How much does it cost to raise a child?",
      "Raising a child in the U.S. doesn't come cheap, with one recent analysis finding parents will spend about $300,000 to raise a child to age 18.",
      "How would a U.S. baby bonus work?",
      "Typically such incentives are paid either through a tax credit or a government check, similar to the stimulus checks that were given to millions of households during the pandemic.",
      "Already, the U.S. has a Child Tax Credit of about $2,000 per child, but that is claimed on a parent's annual tax return, which means families must wait until tax season to collect the benefit.",
      "\"Unlike the Child Tax Credit, a baby bonus could come right after a child is born \u2014 there would be no wait until next year's tax season to get the money that parents need for a crib and a car seat today,\" wrote senior policy analyst Leah Sargeant in a recent post at the Niskanen Center, a political think tank. \"It can be more generously structured than the CTC because it is a supplement for a single, critical year, not an ongoing payment.\"",
      "How much would a $5,000 baby bonus cost the U.S.?",
      "If the parent of every child born in the U.S. annually qualified for a $5,000 bonus, the cost could mount to more than $15 billion a year.",
      "That could be tough to pass at a time when Republican lawmakers are seeking to reduce federal spending in order to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's tax cuts, which is currently part of a bill advancing in Congress.",

      "Nearly four months into 2025, the United States recorded the most measles cases in a single year since a 2019 wave, and the number continues to grow, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. The majority of the infections have been reported in an outbreak in West Texas that has led to\u00a0the deaths\u00a0of two children.",
      "The number of cases in Texas alone has grown to\u00a0646, while cases nationwide have hit 884, with infections confirmed in at least 29 states.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",

      "The Texas outbreak is primarily affecting\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or have an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "The highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",

      "Luigi Mangione pleads not guilty in NYC federal murder case",
      "Federal prosecutors\u00a0indicted Mangione last week\u00a0on two counts of stalking, a firearm offense and murder through the use of a firearm in Thompson's 2024 shooting death.",
      "Mangione, 26, stood with his lawyers as he entered his plea Friday. He leaned forward to a microphone as U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett asked him if understood the indictment and the charges against him.",
      "Mangione said, \"yes.\" When asked how he wished to plead, he said, \"not guilty\" and sat down.",
      "The pleas were not unexpected, since Mangione also pleaded not guilty to state charges he's facing in New York and Pennsylvania.",
      "The judge overseeing the case said she hopes to set a trial date during the next federal court conference on Dec. 5.",
      "Pam Bondi, DOJ seeking death penalty against Mangione",
      "Mangione's arraignment came a day after the U.S. Department of Justice formally told the court it intends to seek the death penalty in the case.",
      "Federal prosecutors say Mangione poses a future danger, alleging in the latest court filing that he intended to \"target an entire industry and rally opposition to that industry by engaging in lethal violence.\"",
      "They also say he took steps to dodge law enforcement, flee New York City after the murder and cross state lines while armed with a privately manufactured gun and silencer.",
      "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi previously said prosecutors would seek the death penalty, marking the first time since President Trump vowed to resume federal executions when he took office in January.",
      "Mangione's attorneys have filed motions asking for the death penalty option to be removed, saying the government \"intends to kill Mr. Mangione as a political stunt.\"",

    "summary": "Momentum in the stock market slowed Friday as some CEOs caution about the impact of trade uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. stocks whipsawed on Friday, signaling an end to a three-day rally that was driven by investor hopes of a de-escalation in the trade war.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 76 points, or 0.2%, to 40,017 in early afternoon trading, while the S&P 500 inched higher 24 points, or 0.4%, to 5,509. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9%, thanks to boost from a handful of Big Tech stocks.",
      "Mr. Trump had adopted a softer tune on trade in recent days, allaying investors' concerns and helping trigger a three-day relief rally following a volatile trading day on Monday. Paul Ashworth, a chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research note that negative activity in the market played a \"key role\" in the president's decision reconsider his steep tariffs on imported Chinese goods, which currently total 145%.",
      "Meanwhile, the markets are also reacting to mixed signals from the White House about potential trade deals.",
      "Mr. Trump this week hinted at a possible trade deal with China, but the Chinese government has denied the two countries are in\u00a0active negotiations.\u00a0CNN did report, however, that China was rolling back the 125% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. semiconductors, a sign it could be relaxing its stance.",
      "\"We're in a headline driven market, and we're prone to volatility spikes and outsized trading ranges in both directions,\" said Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment analyst at eToro. \"And you know, it's probably going to remain that type of market until we at least have more clarity on what's going on.\"",
      "In a Time interview released Friday morning, Mr. Trump suggested his administration has struck 200 trade deals with countries, and that those would be announced in the next three to four weeks.",
      "CEOs: \"Elevated uncertainty\"",
      "On Thursday and Friday, several companies cautioned that uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's trade war is making it difficult to give financial forecasts for the upcoming year.",
      "Intel weighed on the market after the chip company said it's seeing \"elevated uncertainty across the industry\" and gave a forecast for upcoming revenue and profit that fell short of analysts' expectations. Its stock fell 6.8% even though its results for the beginning of the year topped expectations.",
      "Eastman Chemical fell 5.9% after it gave a forecast for profit this spring that fell short of analysts' expectations. CEO Mark Costa said that the \"macroeconomic uncertainty that defined the last several years has only increased\" and that future demand for its products \"is unclear given the magnitude and scope of tariffs.\"",
      "Skechers U.S.A., the shoe and apparel company, pulled its financial forecasts for the year due to \"macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies\" even though it just reported a record quarter of revenue at $2.41 billion. Its stock fell 4.3%.",
      "Trade deals",
      "Over the last few weeks, the president and members of his administration have been meeting with different countries to discuss bi-lateral trade deals. This comes after Mr. Trump paused the implementation of so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days \u2014 providing a sigh of relief to markets and consumers alike. This pause, UBS analysts said, demonstrates that the president is aware of how tariffs might be negatively impacting market activity.",
      "\"So, while we expect equity markets to remain choppy, the risk-reward for stocks is looking more appealing, especially now that we know that Trump is attuned to the risks from his tariff policies,\" said David Lefkowitz, head of US equities at UBS Global Wealth Management in a research note.",
      "Lefkowitz said that the tariff-induced slowdown will hinder corporate profit growth, but that projected the economy would rebound next year as businesses and consumers acclimate to tariffs and the Fed introduces rate cuts.",
      "Tariffs on China could be slashed to as low as 50 to 65%, the Wall Street Journal this week\u00a0reported. But even if tariffs do come down as a result of trade negotiations, that doesn't mean the U.S. economy is out of the woods yet. The remaining levies could still stifle economic growth, analysts say.",
      "\"The April 2 rose garden start on tariffs might have been the high water mark, but you're still talking about a significant burden that is being imposed on companies and the economy from tariffs,\" said Adam Crisafulli, an analyst at Vital Knowledge. \"And that's not going away.\"",
      "While the U.S. stock market lost some steam on Friday, an ease in 10-year Treasury yields and a rebound in U.S. dollar index provided welcome signs of relief. The 10-year Treasury fell to 4.28% from 4.32% late Thursday, while value of the U.S. dollar ticked up to throughout the week, strengthening its value against the euro and other rival currencies.",

    "summary": "Shortening permitting procedures for mining and oil drilling could adversely affect the environment, communities and endangered species, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it will accelerate permit approvals for mining, drilling and fossil fuel production and transportation on public land, fast-tracking a review process that would normally take years.",
      "In announcing the emergency procedures Wednesday, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the management of federal lands and natural resources, said the permitting process will now take up to \"28 days at most\" \u2014 a drastic departure from the current one- to two-year timeline.",
      "The government agency said the move is in response to President Trump's January 20 declaration of a national energy emergency. In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail. The new guidelines will apply to a wide range of energy projects, including crude oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The U.S. leads the world in\u00a0oil\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0production, with an output of 20 million barrels of oil a day and accounting for roughly a quarter of global gas production, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "The DOI said it would use emergency authorities under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to expedite the permitting process.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to wait,\" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \"President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security, and these emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.\"",
      "Lawsuits to come, experts say",
      "Environmental advocates rebuked the announcement, saying that in addition to adverse environmental impacts on public land and water sources, the expedited procedures will strip away community members' ability to weigh in on projects happening in their own backyards. Experts say the move is expected to draw legal challenges.",
      "\"What they're proposing to do is basically forgo environmental review or public participation or anything meaningful,\" said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. \"The implications of that are extreme.\"",
      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Section 7 of the Act requires consultation among agencies \"to ensure their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of federally protected species, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",
      "A win for oil and gas industries",
      "The announcement on Wednesday was a win for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, which has\u00a0cheered\u00a0Mr. Trump's energy agenda.",
      "\"Our nation's permitting system is broken, and reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy,\" Holly Hopkins, VP of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Former officials from several different federal agencies who served under Mr. Trump's previous term and the Biden administration have told CBS News on background that looming workforce reductions could throw a wrench in the department's plans to speed up the permitting process. Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon. An internal White House document obtained by The Washington Post indicated that as many as 1 in 4 department employees could be let go as a part of a broader series of staff cuts across government agencies.",
      "\"How can you accomplish so much with fewer and fewer people?\" said Burger of Columbia's Sabin Center. \"The only result is less and less oversight.\"",
      "Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, agreed, adding that gutting the federal agency could hinder the Trump administration's objectives.",
      "\"They just don't seem to understand that these employees run the gamut from wildlife biologists to firefighters, to people who permit oil and gas drilling or permit mines on federal lands,\" he said. \"If it's going to wholesale cut staff, some of the things they care about are going to get caught up in that.\"",
      "The Department of Interior did not respond to request for comment on how layoffs might impact its ability to issue permits on a tighter timetable.",
      "According to the new procedural guidelines issued by the agency this week, companies seeking a permit are required to confirm in writing that they want their project covered by the expedited process \u2014 meaning that not everyone will necessarily opt in. Those that do could stand to lose big, Manuel said.",
      "\"Companies are very cautious before they sink millions of dollars into a well or to a mining project,\" he said. \"So I think they benefit from going slowly because they don't want to be stuck with a stranded asset or literally drill a dry hole here.\"",

    "summary": "Day 1 of the 2025 NFL Draft started with Cam Ward as the first pick, which marked the third straight year a quarterback went No. 1 overall. See the full results from the first round.",
    "story": [
      "The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in Thursday's NFL Draft, a drama-free move that had been predicted for weeks by football pundits, and one of only two quarterbacks taken in the entire first round.",
      "In a sign of the importance of the position, Ward becomes the third straight quarterback to go No. 1 overall, after the Chicago Bears selected USC's Caleb Williams with the first pick in 2024, and the Carolina Panthers selected Alabama's Bryce Young in 2023.",
      "The last non-quarterback to go No. 1 was Georgia defensive end Travon Walker in 2022, picked by the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
      "Although Ward was considered a virtual lock to go to the Titans, the rest of the draft was playing out as one of the most unpredictable in years.",
      "That unpredictability came to fruition almost immediately when, after Ward's selection, the Jacksonville Jaguars traded a haul \u2014 including the No. 5 pick \u2014 to the Cleveland Browns in order to move up to No. 2 and take two-way Colorado star Travis Hunter, who has expressed a desire to play both cornerback and receiver in the NFL as he did in college.",

      "A young woman who says she was raped and threatened by retired NFL player Shannon Sharpe during a \"rocky consensual relationship\" has filed a civil lawsuit against him seeking $50 million in damages.",
      "Attorneys filed the lawsuit Sunday in Clark County, Nevada, for a woman listed in court documents as Jane Doe. The lawsuit also accuses Sharpe of using physical force on her and inflicting emotional distress.",
      "The lawsuit \"lays out a pattern of intimidation, manipulation, and abuse, including allegations that Sharpe repeatedly threatened to choke and slap Jane Doe,\" attorney Tony Buzbee said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The woman first met Sharpe at a gym in Los Angeles in 2023 when she was 20 and a nearly two-year relationship followed, according to court documents. Sharpe, 56, is accused of raping the woman in October 2024 and again in January, court documents said.",

      "Sharpe is accused of becoming increasingly verbally abusive, controlling and violent over time, once threatening to kill her and recording their sexual encounters without consent, according to the complaint.",
      "\"Sharpe flew into fits of anger when Plaintiff noted his infidelity to their relationship, or called him out about his extraneous activities,\" the lawsuit said. \"Sharpe even figured out how to get into Doe's apartment complex without her permission.\"",
      "Sharpe's next steps",
      "Sharpe said Thursday he is stepping away temporarily from his ESPN duties while he deals with what he called false allegations in the lawsuit.",

      "A new carnivorous caterpillar that wears the remains of its prey has been dubbed the \"bone collector.\"",
      "The insect is only found on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It creeps along spiderwebs, feeding on trapped insects and adorning its silk case with their body parts.",
      "In findings,\u00a0published Thursday in the journal Science, researchers said the caterpillar \"boasts an unprecedented and macabre practice of decorating its portable larval home with the body parts of the spider prey it harvests from the web where it resides.\"",
      "There are other meat-eating caterpillars that \"do lots of crazy things, but this takes the cake,\" said study author Dan Rubinoff with the University of Hawaii at Manoa.",
      "Scientists think the case might act as camouflage, allowing the caterpillar to feast on the spider's ensnared meals without getting caught.",

      "\"I think the term is out there in the ether, and just fit with what these caterpillars are doing. It's a bit tongue in cheek because arthropods don't actually have bones,\" Rubinoff told\u00a0the Reuters news agency.",
      "A host of caterpillars native to Hawaii use silk glands to spin protective cases studded with lichen, sand and other materials. This one is the first to use ant heads and fly wings.",
      "\"It really is an astonishing type of case,\" said Steven Montgomery, an entomology consultant in Hawaii who was not involved with the new study.",

      "Predatory caterpillars are extremely rare and the bone collectors found in Hawaii will even eat each other, researchers said.",
      "The bone collector's origins date back at least 6 million years, making the caterpillars more than one million years older than the Hawaiian islands themselves. Today, they dwell on an isolated patch of mountain forest alongside invasive species.",
      "The spider \"is restricted to 15 square kilometers of a single mountain range on the island of O\u02bbahu, meaning that other members of the lineage have disappeared from older islands,\" the scientists wrote.",

    "story": [
      "When the charred remains of prominent commercial real estate attorney Gary Farris were discovered on a burn pile with a bullet lodged in a rib bone, detectives knew they were facing a homicide investigation. The crime scene was on a sprawling 10-acre property in Cherokee County, Georgia, where Gary Farris lived with his wife Melody and their son Scott.",
      "It was July 2018 when detectives found Gary Farris' blood and a second bullet in the basement of the home and questioned how his body could have ended up on the burn pile, about 50 yards away. Soon after their arrival on scene, investigators found themselves entangled in a family drama with mother and son pointing the finger at each other.",
      "\"This is a mother's worst nightmare \u2026 it has been called the Farris wheel, and it was, but it was our Farris wheel,\" Melody Farris tells \"48 Hours\" correspondent Peter Van Sant in an exclusive interview.",
      "Van Sant and \"48 Hours\" investigate the murder of Gary Farris in \"The Farris Wheel\" airing Saturday, April 26, at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Investigators learned Scott Farris was responsible for the day-to-day operations on the farm and that his work and personal expenses were covered by his father. According to Melody Farris, around the time of Gary Farris' death there was tension between him and Scott Farris, mainly about Scott needing to get another job. Scott Farris, however, says that is not true and tension in the home was caused by Melody Farris disappearing for weeks at a time and spending Gary Farris' money.",
      "Gary Farris was the sole bread winner and allowed Melody and Scott Farris access to accounts in his name. Scott Farris said his mother was away for extended periods of time because she was having an affair with her lover who lived in Tennessee.",
      "In June 2019, after an almost 12-month investigation, Melody Farris was arrested for the murder of Gary Farris.",
      "When her trial began in October 2024, her defense team said she was innocent and pointed the finger at Scott Farris. They said at his size, about 6 feet 8 inches, 280 pounds, he was more capable of moving Gary's 6-foot-4-inch, 300-pound body than his much smaller mother.",
      "But police and prosecutors believed Melody Farris was the murderer. Prosecutors argued, among other things, that Melody Farris was the only one home at the time they believe Gary Farris was killed. And at trial they called a witness from the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office Intelligence Division who analyzed phone records and discovered that Gary Farris' cellphone moved from the house to the burn pile and back to the house after investigators believe his body was already on the burn pile. Melody Farris was the only one home at that time as well.",
      "On Nov. 4, 2024, Melody Farris was found guilty of murdering her husband. She had not spoken publicly until her sentencing hearing a month later when she shocked the courtroom, saying, \"Not only did I not do this, I know who did. I know Scott killed his father.\"",
      "Immediately after Melody Farris was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 30 years, she walked into an exclusive interview with Van Sant, where she continued to profess her innocence.",
      "Melody Farris told Van Sant she saw Scott Farris near the burn pile the morning before Gary Farris' body was discovered. She said she believes Scott Farris used his pickup truck to get Gary Farris' body to the burn pile. And she went as far as saying Scott Farris planted the bullet that was found in the basement to frame her. Melody Farris says she believes Scott Farris killed his father because he wanted the farm to be his and would refer to it as his property in conversation.",
      "Melody Farris told Van Sant, \"\u2026 it's the perfect murder. You kill your daddy. You set your mother up. She goes to prison. You get everything.\"",
      "Scott Farris also sat down with Van Sant and told him, \"I absolutely had nothing to do with my father's death. And it was 100% Melody Farris who murdered my father. That is the truth.\"",
      "Scott Farris says Melody Farris is the only one who wanted Gary Farris dead, and he never drove his truck near the burn pile. As for the bullet being planted, Scott Farris said, \"I didn't even know there was a bullet found in the basement until after she was arrested.\"",
      "Scott Farris says he was an easy target because he lived on the property with his parents and was former military. Investigators were able to rule him out as a suspect and he was not charged with anything relating to the death of his father.",
      "When asked if she was willing to sacrifice one of her children's lives to save herself, Melody Farris said, \"absolutely not.\" But Scott Farris says Melody Farris needs to stop with the lies and just come clean: \"she knows she did it.\"",

      "Hemphill, who remains jailed after his arrest last month, pleaded not guilty to a 116-count indictment charging him with predatory sexual assault and other crimes dating to last October. The 43-year-old, who is also a lawyer, threatened to have victims arrested or disappeared in a bid to keep them silent, prosecutors said.",

      "In a news release, prosecutors posted images of other items they said were recovered from his apartment, including a cattle prod, handcuffs and fake cash. They also posted threatening text messages that Hemphill allegedly sent to victims.",
      "Hemphill met the six women through websites, including some that specialize in \"sugar daddy\" arrangements for women seeking wealthy romantic partners, Curzer said.",
      "He told the women he was into role play and dominance and offered them large sums of money in exchange for sex and companionship, though he ended up not paying some of the women or giving them fake cash instead, Curzer said.",
      "As Hemphill got to know the women, he convinced them to confide their past sexual traumas, which he then deliberately reenacted as he assaulted them, Curzer said. He took advantage of some victims' inexperience, the prosecutor said, or crossed boundaries that victims had clearly articulated.",
      "Hemphill is accused of tricking victims into ingesting substances that rendered them unable to fight back, using handcuffs and other restraints on them, wrapping their heads and faces with duct tape, slapping and punching them, and torturing them with a cattle prod and shock collar.",
      "Hemphill kept one victim shackled to a bed for hours while she begged him to let her go, Curzer said.",
      "Hemphill's alleged conduct is \"truly shocking to the conscience,\" and he \"has made clear that he has no regard for the law or the courts,\" Curzer said.",
      "To keep women quiet, Hemphill boasted about connections to law enforcement and organized crime, prosecutors said, and claimed that because the women had accepted offers of money, it was them who would be arrested.",
      "Hemphill is charged with bribing a witness and, according to prosecutors, drew up a contract in which he agreed to pay a woman $2,000 in exchange for dropping a complaint she filed with police. He is also accused of forcing some victims to record videos in which they stated that they had consented to being abused.",
      "\"The power imbalance in his predatory acts could not be more clear,\" Bragg told reporters. \"He wielded his law degree and money as both sword and shield, coercing and silencing survivors.\"",
      "The arraignment happened down the hall from disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein's rape retrial.",
      "Scherzer ordered Hemphill to remain jailed without bail after prosecutors raised concerns that his predicament, combined with his wealth and connections - including a history of philanthropy and family real estate holdings \u2014 could give him the means and incentive to flee the country.",
      "Hemphill's lawyer, a public defender assigned to represent him at least through his arraignment, had urged Scherzer to move him to a rehabilitation facility to deal with substance abuse issues.",
      "Scherzer ruled that, given the fact pattern laid out by prosecutors, \"including efforts to dissuade by force and threats to witnesses from testifying against him,\" jailing him was the only way to ensure Hemphill would return to court.",
      "Hemphill's alleged behavior, the judge said, \"shows his extent to which he's willing to go to protect himself from facing these charges.\"",
      "\"The details in this case are beyond disturbing \u2014 a sustained, calculated campaign of violence and cruelty that targeted vulnerable women,\" NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said in a\u00a0statement. \"This kind of predatory abuse has no place in our city and will be met with the full force of the law.\"",

      "The Trump administration conceded on Thursday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents did not have a warrant when they detained Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil in March, acknowledging it was a \"warrantless arrest.\"",
      "Khalil's attorneys are asking an immigration judge in Louisiana, where their client has been detained by ICE for weeks, to terminate his deportation case based on the fact that he was arrested without a warrant.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, admitted in a court filing that immigration agents typically need warrants before arresting individuals. But it argued that Khalil was arrested without a warrant due to \"exigent circumstances,\" alleging that agents believed the Columbia activist would \"escape before they could obtain a warrant.\"",
      "Khalil's lawyers denied that he had any plans to flee, saying in their own court filing that their client \"fully complied\" with the ICE agents' demands.",
      "\"Tellingly, no agent present at the scene has ever submitted sworn or unsworn testimony that Mr. Khalil attempted to flee or otherwise posed a flight risk,\" Khalil's lawyers wrote in a court document.",
      "A vocal member of the protests at Columbia University last year over the war in Gaza, Khalil is a Syrian-born immigrant with legal U.S. permanent residency \u2014 also known as a green card. He was arrested in early March by ICE, outside of his New York City apartment, where he lived with his U.S. citizen wife, who was pregnant at the time.",
      "Khalil was not able to witness the birth of his son\u00a0earlier this week, after ICE denied a request for him to be temporarily released.",
      "One of several foreign-born students arrested by ICE in recent months, Khalil has become one of the most high-profile faces of the Trump administration's efforts to go after those on college campuses who have participated in pro-Palestinian protests.",
      "The Trump administration has argued its efforts are designed to curb anti-semitism and pro-Hamas views at universities, but civil rights groups have accused the government of punishing students purely for their political beliefs, in violation of the First Amendment.",
      "While it has not accused Khalil of any criminal wrongdoing, the Trump administration has cited two legal grounds to argue the Columbia University activist should nonetheless be deported from the U.S.",
      "The administration has accused Khalil of committing immigration fraud by withholding certain information on his green card application and argued he's also deportable due to a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that his presence and activities pose \"adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S. Khalil's lawyers have refuted both accusations.",
      "Earlier this month, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled the administration could continue its bid to deport Khalil, saying she could not second-guess Rubio's determination, which cites a rarely used law. She held in abeyance the immigration fraud accusation.",
      "This week, Khalil formally submitted an application in immigration court to request asylum and withholding of removal, another legal protection from deportation, according to his attorneys.",
      "That immigration court case in Louisiana is progressing alongside a lawsuit in federal district court in New Jersey challenging the legality of Khalil's detention. Lawyers in that case have asked the federal judge overseeing it to order Khalil's release, revoke Rubio's determination and bar the government from targeting noncitizens \"who engage in constitutionally protected expressive activity in the United States in support of Palestinian rights or critical of Israel.\"",

I think he's an amazing young leader who's done so much already to help move our movement forward,\" Martin continued. \"If you want to challenge incumbents, you're more than free to do that, but just not as an officer of the DNC, because our job is to be neutral arbiters.\"",
      "Hogg co-founded Leaders We Deserve in 2020, a grassroots organization that just launched a $20 million initiative to primary \"out of touch\" House Democrats who are \"unable or unwilling to meet the moment.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 16:26:03 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's executive order would require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship in order to register to vote in federal elections.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday agreed to block portions of President Trump's executive order that seeks to overhaul U.S. elections, including a provision that would require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship in order to register to vote in federal elections.",
      "U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly agreed to partially grant a preliminary injunction sought by three different groups of plaintiffs, including voting rights groups and the Democratic Party, finding that they are likely to prevail in their challenge.",
      "The judge blocked the Trump administration from implementing two provisions of the executive order signed by the president last month: the first orders the Election Assistance Commission, a federal independent regulatory commission, to add a \"documentary proof of U.S. citizenship\" requirement to the standardized national voter registration form; and the second ordered federal voter registration agencies to \"assess\" citizenship before providing a federal voter registration form to people who receive public assistance.",
      "Kollar-Kotelly, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, said that the president generally does not have the power to regulate federal elections.",
      "\"Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the states \u2014not the president \u2014 with the authority to regulate federal elections,\" Kollar-Kotelly wrote in a 120-page opinion. \"Consistent with that allocation of power, Congress is currently debating legislation that would effect many of the changes the president purports to order. And no statutory delegation of authority to the executive branch permits the president to short-circuit Congress's deliberative process by executive order.\"",
      "In response to the decision, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, said, \"President Trump will keep fighting for election integrity, despite Democrat objections that reveal their disdain for commonsense safeguards like verifying citizenship. Free and fair elections are the bedrock of our Constitutional Republic, and we're confident in securing an ultimate victory in the courtroom.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's directive follows years of unfounded claims raised by him and his allies that the 2020 election was rigged against him, allegations the president has continued to amplify during his second term in the White House. The order claims that the U.S. \"now fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections employed by modern, developed nations, as well as those still developing.\"",
      "\"Free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional Republic. The right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election,\" the executive order states.",
      "While Congress has the power to decide how federal elections are run, and has done so through laws like the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act, the Constitution gives state legislatures the authority to set the \"times, places and manner\" of holding elections.",
      "In addition to the now-blocked citizenship-related requirements, the president's executive order seeks to give the White House's Department of Government Efficiency and states access to certain databases to identify any noncitizens who are registered to vote; orders the attorney general to enforce two laws against states that include absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day in the final tally of votes for president and Congress; and orders the Election Assistance Commission to condition federal funds on states adopting Election Day as the deadline for receiving ballots.",
      "Those provisions were at the center of the lawsuits filed by a slew of voting rights groups and arms of the Democratic Party, including the Democratic National Committee and the party's congressional leaders. They argued that the president did not have the power to issue those changes and could not make them unilaterally.",
      "Kollar-Kotelly agreed that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their challenge to two sections of the order, requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the federal voter registration form and requiring people enrolled in public assistance programs to have their citizenship assessed before getting the federal voter registration form.",
      "But she declined to stop the Trump administration from implementing the other parts of the president's order as the litigation moves forward.",
      "The Justice Department will likely appeal the decision.",
      "As to the proof-of-citizenship requirement, Kollar-Kotelly wrote neither the Constitution nor federal voter registration law gives the president the authority to direct the Election Assistance Commission to change what is on the federal registration form.",
      "\"The president is free to state his views about what policies he believes that Congress, the EAC, or other federal agencies should consider or adopt. But in this case, the president has done much more than state his views: He has issued an 'order' directing that an independent commission 'shall' act to 'require' changes to an important document, the contents of which Congress has tightly regulated,\" the judge wrote. \"That command exceeds the president's authority.\"",
      "On the second provision that Kollar-Kotelly blocked, she said people applying for public assistance programs are entitled to the federal voter registration form, not recipients who have complied with the identification requirements imposed by the programs.",
      "She said provisions of the National Voter Registration Act \"make clear that voter registration agencies' only role in enforcing states' citizenship requirement for voting is to provide the federal form to the applicant, who must then self-certify citizenship by signing the application 'under penalty of perjury.' The statute leaves no role for agencies to 'assess citizenship,' and the president lacks any lawful authority to contravene the NVRA by requiring agencies to do so.\"",
      "Roman Palomares, national president of the voting rights group LULAC, cheered Kollar-Kotelly's decision as a victory for voters and democracy.",
      "\"Efforts to silence the voice and votes of the U.S. electorate must not stand because our democracy depends on all voters feeling confident that they can vote freely and that their vote will be counted accurately,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and co-counsel partners, which are representing the League of Women Voters, said in a joint statement that the judge's decision provides protections for eligible voters, many of which do not have easy access to a passport or other citizenship documents.",
      "\"The president's attempted takeover of federal elections is a blatant overreach to seize power that doesn't belong to him. Under the Constitution, that power belongs to the U.S. Congress and states,\" they said. \"The president lacks authority to rewrite the country's election rules on his own by weaponizing an independent, bipartisan commission to harm eligible voters. The order should ultimately be struck down.\"",

      "As the late pontiff lies in state in St. Peter's Basilica\u00a0before his funeral at St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday, April 26, Americans are searching for flights to pay their respects in person. Flight searches to Rome surged 250% in the three days following Pope Francis' death on Monday, compared with searches over the same period in 2024, according to travel booking site Expedia.com.",
      "Searches for lodging in Rome through the fare aggregator have also shot up 35% for the same dates, compared to the same period a year ago. While U.S. residents largely account for the burst in demand for travel to Rome, global searches from other countries are also up 125% for the week, according to Expedia.",
      "\"I can't think of any other event that has caused a sudden spike in travel searches like this,\" Expedia travel expert Melanie Fish told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And it's not only flight searches. It's accommodation searches, too, and it's clear why because of the travel dates.\"",
      "Scott Keyes, founder and CEO of flight deals website Going.com, said search interest in travel to Rome for April 21-23 has nearly tripled since the pope's death, compared with the three previous days.",
      "For tourists thinking of booking a jaunt to Italy, the bad news is that the surge in demand for fights to Rome is driving up airfares, according to Going.com. For flights from the U.S. to Rome departing between April 22-25 and returning April 27-30, airfares are up about 33% compared to flight prices in the days leading up to Pope Francis' death.",
      "Fish noted that ticket prices typically rise closest to the travel date, and Expedia is expecting prices for flights to Rome to rise as Friday approaches. That's in part because airlines can't immediately add more capacity despite increased demand, she noted. \"So what you'll likely see is crowded flights and prices spiking today and tomorrow.\"",

      "California is providing the gift cards at the clinics, which are run by the state's vendor. The CDC also has a testing van from the agency's Avian Flu Influenza Area Surveillance Testing, or AFAST project, offering testing at some of the sites.",
      "\"Funding for the gift cards comes out of California's bird flu state emergency declaration funds. CDC does testing only and offers no incentives of any kind,\" a spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health said in an email.",
      "The effort runs contrary to rumors on social media that states have stopped testing symptomatic farmworkers for bird flu, at the behest of the CDC under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "\"There has been no change to our guidance for testing suspect cases, we are not aware of any symptomatic workers not being referred or tested for H5N1, and it is very unlikely that testing would be declined if H5N1 was suspected,\" the California spokesperson said.",
      "A CDC spokesperson also said their guidance had not changed. The agency continues to recommend people with symptoms seek testing from their doctor or local health department.",
      "Authorities in neighboring Nevada told CBS News they are also continuing to offer testing and treatment to farm workers exposed to bird flu infections in their animals.

    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order that directed the Pentagon to develop a policy that would bar transgender people from serving in the military.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to allow his administration's policy prohibiting transgender people from serving in the military to take effect while legal challenges to the ban move forward.",
      "The request for the Supreme Court's intervention comes after a federal appeals court left in place a lower court order that prevents the Trump administration from enforcing the ban nationwide. The administration has attacked these broad orders, known as nationwide or universal injunctions, issued by federal district court judges as improperly setting policy for the country.",
      "Mr. Trump banned transgender people from serving in the military during his first term in office, which the Supreme Court in 2019 allowed to take effect,\u00a0but the policy was rescinded by former President Joe Biden. When Mr. Trump returned to office in January for his second term, he issued a new executive order that declared it to be U.S. government policy to \"establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity,\" and said that policy is \"inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria.\"",
      "The president's directive said that \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life. A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\"",
      "On the heels of the president's order, the Defense Department issued a new policy in February that generally disqualifies from military service people with gender dysphoria or who have undergone medical interventions for gender dysphoria. The plan from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth required all military branches to start identifying transgender service members and begin the process of separating them from service on March 26 unless they obtained a waiver.",
      "Roughly 1,892 active-duty members of the military received gender-affirming care from the Defense Department between January 2016 and May 2021, according to a\u00a0January report\u00a0from the Congressional Research Service. The Justice Department has said that the Pentagon does not have data on service members by gender identity, but a defense official said that as of Dec. 9, there were about 4,200 troops who had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. There are more than 1.2 million active-duty members of the military, according to the Defense Department.",
      "Between 2015 and 2024, the Defense Department spent $52 million for care to active-duty service members to treat gender dysphoria, according to a\u00a0Feb. 26 memo\u00a0from the Pentagon.",
      "The case before the Supreme Court arose out a challenge to the ban filed in Washington state, which was brought by seven transgender service members, one transgender person who wants to join the military and an advocacy group. They argued that the president's ban violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and the First Amendment.",
      "A federal district court in March agreed to block implementation of the executive order and required the Trump administration to maintain the policy put in place by its predecessor.",
      "In his opinion granting a preliminary injunction, U.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle said the Trump administration did not put forth any evidence that allowing transgender people to serve openly harmed military readiness, unit cohesion or lethality.",
      "\"The government's unrelenting reliance on deference to military judgment is unjustified in the absence of any evidence supporting 'the military's' new judgment reflected in the Military Ban \u2014 in its equally considered and unquestionable judgment, that very same military had only the week before permitted active-duty plaintiffs (and some thousands of others) to serve openly,\" he wrote.",
      "Settle was appointed to the district court in Tacoma by President George W. Bush and was a captain in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps, serving as a prosecutor in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and defense counsel in Fort Lewis, Washington.",
      "Settle wrote in his opinion that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, and said they raised \"serious and important questions.\"",
      "\"Because the military has operated smoothly for four years under the Austin Policy, any claimed hardship it may face in the meantime pales in comparison to the hardships imposed on transgender service members and otherwise qualified transgender accession candidates, tipping the balance of hardships sharply toward plaintiffs,\" he said, referencing former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who led the Pentagon under Biden. \"There can be few matters of greater public interest in this country than protecting the constitutional rights of its citizens.\"",
      "The Justice Department then asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to pause that decision, allowing it the ban to take effect, but it denied the request.",
      "A similar challenge to Mr. Trump's ban was filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., where it, too, was blocked from taking effect. But the federal appeals court in Washington agreed to temporarily halt that order and heard arguments Tuesday on whether to keep its block in place while the appeal continues.",

      "\"Absent a stay, the district court's universal injunction will remain in place for the duration of further review in the Ninth Circuit and in this court \u2014 a period far too long for the military to be forced to maintain a policy that it has determined, in its professional judgment, to be contrary to military readiness and the nation's interests,\" he wrote.",
      "Sauer rejected the claim that the administration's rules discriminate based on transgender status and sex and said the policy draws classifications based on a medical condition \u2014 gender dysphoria \u2014 and related medical interventions, which means it satisfies the lowest, most deferential standard of judicial review.",
      "\"The Constitution entrusts to the political branches the authority to determine the composition of the armed forces.

      "\"I walk around with the right dress, I travel with clothes just in case something pops off,\" she explained. \"So I was like, if I'm not going to do this thing, I gotta tell my team, I don't even want to have a dress ready, right? Because it's so easy to just say, 'let me do the right thing.'\"",
      "Henson commended Obama for her choice, saying if she doesn't make choices for herself, she becomes \"a shock absorber.\"",
      "\"And that's what women are. We're shock absorbers, and that's exhausting and it's not healthy,\" Henson said. \"You've had to be shock absorbers for your husband, for your children, for your mom, for your family, your loved ones because of where you were sitting in the public eye. That's not fair to you. When do you ever get to live for you?\"",

      "Security camera footage posted by the Izvestia newspaper showed a massive explosion, sending fragments flying into the air. The blast happens just as someone can be seen walking towards the car.",
      "The \"blast was caused by the triggering of an improvised explosive device\" packed with metal fragments designed to cause maximum harm, investigators said.",

      "A Russian drone struck an apartment building in a city in southeastern Ukraine, killing three people and injuring 10 others, officials said Friday, a day after President Trump rebuked Russia's leader for a deadly missile and drone attack on Kyiv while Washington endeavors to stop the more than three-year war.",
      "Among the civilians killed in the nighttime drone strike in Pavlohrad, in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, were a child and a 76-year-old woman, the head of the regional administration, Serhii Lysak, wrote on Telegram.",
      "Russian forces fired 103 Shahed and decoy drones at five Ukrainian regions overnight, Ukraine's air force reported. Authorities in the northeastern Sumy and Kharkiv regions reported damage to civilian infrastructure but no casualties.",
      "Russia pounded Kyiv in an hourslong barrage Thursday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 87 in its deadliest assault on the Ukrainian capital since July. The attack drew a rare rebuke of Russian President Vladimir Putin from Mr. Trump, who has said that efforts to end the war are coming to a head.",
      "\"I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. \"Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!\"",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told CBS News on Thursday that the Kremlin was \"ready to reach a deal\" with the U.S. on Ukraine, though he also said some elements need to be \"fine tuned.\"",

      "Russian forces used Thursday's Kyiv attack as cover to launch almost 150 assaults on Ukrainian positions along the roughly 620-mile front line, Zelenskyy said late Thursday.",
      "\"When the maximum of our forces was focused on defense against missiles and drones, the Russians went on to significantly intensify their ground attacks,\" he wrote on Telegram.",
      "Western European leaders have accused Putin of dragging his feet in the negotiations and seeking to grab more Ukrainian territory while his army has battlefield momentum.",
      "Mr. Trump accused Zelenskyy of prolonging the \"killing field\" by refusing to surrender the Russia-occupied Crimea Peninsula as part of a possible deal.

      "\"One of the scenarios is ... to give up territory. It's not fair. But for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution, temporary,\" Klitschko told the BBC. He said, however, that Ukraine would \"never accept occupation\" by Russia.",

His body has been lying in state for three days in St. Peter's Basilica, where members of the public have been filing past to pay their respects.",
      "Unlike his predecessors, who were buried in three nested coffins \u2014 one made of cypress, one made of lead, and one made of elm \u2014 the famously humble Francis chose to be buried in a simple wooden coffin.",
      "That change came as part of recently updated funeral planning for pontiffs, published late last year and approved by Francis.",
      "The updated Ordo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis, as it's called in Latin, also says that the public will be able to view the pope's body in an open coffin.",
      "Another break from tradition is its direction that the ascertainment of the pope's death should take place in a chapel, not his room.",
      "\"A second edition [of the official funeral rites for pontiffs] became necessary, first of all because Pope Francis has requested it, as he himself has stated on several occasions of the need to simplify and adapt certain rites so that the celebration of the funeral of the Bishop of Rome may better expresses [sic] the faith of the Church in the Risen Christ,\" Archbishop Diego Ravelli, Master of Apostolic Ceremonies, said in a statement released by the Vatican at the time of the update.",
      "Archbishop Ravelli also said \"the renewed rite also needed to emphasise even more that the funeral of the Roman Pontiff is that of a pastor and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful person of this world.\"",
      "The other major break from papal funeral tradition is the place where Francis has chosen to be buried.",
      "In his last will and testament, published shortly after his death, Francis requested that he be laid to rest outside the Vatican, in the Papal Basilica of St. Mary Major (Santa Maria Maggiore, in Italian). He often visited that ancient church in Rome to pray before and after his travels.",
      "Many popes are laid to rest inside the Vatican, in the Vatican grottoes, a system of vaults on the lower level of St. Peter's Basilica, but the basilica says seven popes over the centuries have been buried at St. Mary Major.",
      "\"I wish that my last earthly journey conclude precisely in this ancient Marian sanctuary where I went for prayer at the beginning and end of each Apostolic journey to confidently entrust my intentions to the Immaculate Mother and thank Her for her docile and maternal care,\" Francis said in his will.",

    "story": [
      "Vatican City \u2014 So many mourners lined up to see Pope Francis lying in state in a simple wooden coffin inside St. Peter's Basilica that the Vatican kept the doors open all night due to higher-than-expected turnout, closing the basilica for just an hour Thursday morning for cleaning.",
      "The basilica closed from 6 a.m. until 7 a.m., the planned opening time and, according to French news agency AFP, thousands lined up early Thursday to pay their respects.",
      "The Vatican said some 48,600 people filed past Francis' coffin from 11 a.m. Wednesday, when public tributes began, through 8:30 a.m. Thursday, AFP reported. Later Thursday, the Vatican put the number at 61,000, AFP said.",
      "The Vatican also announced that the pontiff's tomb can be visited starting Sunday morning, AFP reported.",
      "The basilica is bathed in a hushed silence as mourners from across the globe make a slow, shuffling procession up the main aisle to pay their last respects to Francis, who died Monday after a stroke and heart failure.",
      "The hours spent on line up the stately via della Conciliazione through St. Peter's Square and through the Holy Door into the basilica enabled mourners to find community around the Argentine pontiff's legacy of inclusion and humble persona.",
      "Emiliano Fernandez, a Catholic from Mexico, was waiting in line around midnight, and after two hours still hadn't reached the basilica.",
      "\"I don't even care how much time I wait here. It's just the opportunity to (show) how I admired Francisco in his life,'' said Fernandez, whose admiration for the pope grew during his 2016 visit to Mexico. \"I think because of the respect that I have for him and the great person he was, it's worth the wait.\"",
      "Among the first-day mourners was a church group of 14-year-olds from near Milan who arrived for the now-suspended canonization of the first millennial saint, as well as a woman who prayed to the pope for a successful operation and an Italian family who brought their small children to see the pope's body.",
      "\"We came because we didn't bring them when he was alive, so we thought we would bring them for a final farewell,'' said Rosa Scorpati, who was exiting the basilica Wednesday with her three children in strollers. \"They were good, but I don't think they really understood because they haven't yet had to deal with death.\"",
      "Like many others, the Scorpati family from Calabria was in Rome on an Easter vacation, only to be met with the news of Francis' death on Easter Monday.",
      "Out of devotion to the pope and his message of inclusion, the grieving faithful joined the procession of mourners that wended from St. Peter's Square through the basilica's Holy Door, with the repentant among them winning an indulgence, a form of atonement granted during the Jubilee Holy Year. From there, the line extended down the basilica's central aisle to the pope's simple wooden casket.",
      "After three days of public viewing, a funeral Mass including heads of state will be held Saturday in St. Peter's Square. The pope will then be buried in a niche within the St. Mary Major Basilica, near his favorite Madonna icon.",
      "The death of Francis, who was 88, capped a 12-year pontificate characterized by his concern for the poor and his message of inclusion, but he was also criticized by some conservatives who felt alienated by his progressive outlook.",
      "A procession of priests, bishops and cardinals accompanied Francis' body Wednesday on its journey from a private viewing inside the Vatican to St. Peter's Square. The pageantry contrasted with the human interactions of rank-and-file mourners at the public viewing.",
      "Francis lay in state in an open casket, perched on a ramp facing mourners, with four Swiss Guards standing at attention. As the crowd reached the casket, many lifted their smartphones to snap a photo.",
      "One nun accompanying an elderly woman with a cane walked away sobbing, \"My pope is gone.''",
      "Such despair was rare. The mood was more one of gratitude for a pope who had, by example, taught many people to open their minds.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eu-fine-apple-meta-breach-digital-markets-act-dma/",
    "published": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 17:07:10 -0400",
    "summary": "The EU has hit Apple and Meta with hundreds of millions of euros in fines as it steps up enforcement of the European Union's Digital Markets Act.",
    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc's digital competition rules. The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \"periodic penalty payments,\" the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It's a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do's and don'ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \"gatekeepers\" from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \"that citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\" Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",
      "\"The decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,\" Virkkunen said.",
      "Both companies indicated they would appeal.",
      "\"The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,\" Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement provided by the U.S. tech giant. \"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\"",
      "Apple accused the commission of \"unfairly targeting\" the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\" despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA's provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \"non-compliant\" conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \"spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\"Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "Apple has also faced a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., where the\u00a0Justice Department alleged\u00a0that the California company illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a \"moat around its smartphone monopoly\" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.",
      "The EU's Meta investigation centered on the company's strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union's top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta's model, saying it doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \"freely consent\" to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also include Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \"currently assessing\" this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",
      "The European Commission has also\u00a0slapped Google with antitrust penalties several times, including a record $5 billion fine levied in 2018 over the search engine's abuse of the market dominance of its Android mobile phone operating system.",

      "Viewership of the movie \"Conclave,\" which depicts the choosing of a new pope, has spiked in the days since Pope Francis died. But how much of the Academy Award winner is accurate to the real event about to take place?",
      "The Rev. Bryan Pham, a Jesuit priest and associate director for Catholic Studies at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, told Fox News Digital he believes the movie was accurate according to the \"timeline and sequence of events of how to handle the death of a pope, the relaying of information, the gathering of the cardinals, and general procedures of getting the new pope elected.\"",
      "Pham, who was a graduate student in Rome during the last conclave that elected Pope Francis in 2013, also said the \"side conversations among the cardinals as they try to identify the challenges and the needs of the church when considering the qualities of the next pope\" rang true.",

      "Pham said the real conclave was an \"extraordinary experience,\" adding that some parts of the movie sensationalized the centuries-old ritual.",
      "\"Where \u2018Conclave\u2019 was clearly a Hollywood movie that wants to be sensational, create potential scandals for shock value in order to make money and perhaps perpetuate the anti-Catholic sentiment (especially in the United States)\" was \"everything else that played into the negative aspect of the Catholic mystique that perpetuate the Catholic Church as primitive and byzantine,\" he said.",

      "Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo, who has personally witnessed three conclaves and is heading back to Rome for this one, said viewership of the movie spiked because it\u2019s \"in the zeitgeist.

      "He noted that \"the writing of the ballot, the going up and swearing before Michelangelo's last judgment,\" raising their ballots and making an oath to the last judgment, placing the ballots in a vessel and having them counted by counters was all accurate.",
      "\"Conclave\" won the Oscar this year for best adapted screenplay. (Alamy)",
      "\"They count votes, and then they run a needle and string through them,\" he continued. \"So, all of that is correct. What's wrong is kind of the surrounds of the thing. The politics, the conversations playing out. It was very cartoonish, melodramatic dialogue.\"",
      "\"None of that happens in that way,\" he said, \"and the intrigue, I wish it were that interesting and fascinating, all the intrigues and people dying, having kids out of wedlock and all that, that's not happening.",

      "Arroyo said the concept \"runs counter to everything the church has ever taught. You know, Jesus didn't say follow me in doubt. He said follow me and believe. So that's what you're called to do. And no, doubt is not part of that.\"",
      "He continued, \"The wonder of miracles is that, you know, they defy reality, they defy natural law. That's the wonder of it: it shatters reality in some ways. But there's no doubt involved in that. It either happened or didn't happen. But if it happens, it wakes a lot of people up, and that's what happened initially. And that's why these people gave their lives for what Jesus said and for Christ himself. They gave their life because he rose again.\"",
      "\"That idea of doubt being at the heart of faith and at the heart of the church is a stupid one,\" he said, \"and one that people, I think a certain cast of mind, would like the church to pursue that path.\"",

      "What happened at Hertz?",
      "Hertz, the global car rental company that also operates Dollar and Thrifty, has\u00a0disclosed a data breach affecting thousands of its customers. The incident stems from a cyberattack on one of its third-party vendors, software provider Cleo, between October and December 2024. The breach did not compromise Hertz\u2019s internal systems directly but involved data that had been shared with the vendor as part of its operational workflow.",
      "The compromised data varies by region but includes sensitive personal information such as names, dates of birth, contact details, driver\u2019s license numbers and, in some cases, Social Security numbers and other government-issued IDs. Certain financial information, including payment card details and workers\u2019 compensation claims, was also among the stolen records.",
      "In the U.S., disclosures were filed with regulatory bodies in California, Texas and Maine. Specifically, 3,457 individuals were affected in Maine and 96,665 in Texas. The total global impact, however, is believed to be far greater. Customers in Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand and the U.K. were also notified via breach notices on Hertz\u2019s regional websites.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The breach is believed to be the work of the Clop ransomware gang, a well-known Russia-linked hacking group. Clop exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Cleo\u2019s enterprise file transfer software, technology used by many large organizations to securely transmit sensitive business data. In 2024, the gang launched a mass-hacking campaign targeting Cleo users, ultimately stealing data from more than 60 companies, including Hertz.",
      "Interestingly, while Hertz was named on Clop\u2019s dark web leak site in 2024, the company initially stated it had \"no evidence\" its systems or data had been compromised.",
      "When contacted by CyberGuy, a Hertz spokesperson said, \"At Hertz, we take the privacy and security of personal information seriously. This vendor event involves Cleo, a file transfer platform used by Hertz for limited purposes. Importantly, to date, our forensic investigation has found no evidence that Hertz's own network was affected by this event. However, among many other companies affected by this event, we have confirmed that Hertz data was acquired by an unauthorized third party that we understand exploited zero-day vulnerabilities within Cleo's platform in October 2024 and December 2024.\"",

      "What does this mean for customers?",
      "While Hertz\u2019s internal systems were not breached, the exposure of personal data, including driver\u2019s license numbers, contact details and government-issued IDs, poses serious risks. Affected individuals may be vulnerable to identity theft, fraudulent account openings and targeted\u00a0phishing attempts. If Social Security numbers were involved, the potential for harm increases significantly. Anyone who rented from Hertz, Dollar or Thrifty between October and December 2024 should be on high alert.",

      "1. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Hertz breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Hertz breach, including Social Security numbers, driver's license and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",

      "Cyber risk doesn\u2019t always come from a company\u2019s own network. It often originates in unseen corners of the digital supply chain. Even as companies double down on internal cybersecurity, they must be equally rigorous in how they vet and monitor third-party vendors. For consumers, it\u2019s no longer enough to trust the big brand on the label. The data trail is wider, the attack surface larger and the consequences far more opaque.",

      "Many of these sketchy extensions presented themselves as tools for search assistance, ad-blocking, security monitoring or extension scanning but shared a connection to a single, unused domain, suggesting coordinated behavior.

      "These extensions are not simply misconfigured tools. They appear to be intentionally designed with surveillance in mind. Many store their configuration data locally, which allows remote servers to update their behavior at any time. This setup is commonly seen in spyware, where changes can be made after installation without alerting the user. The code is heavily obfuscated, making it difficult for researchers to understand what the extensions are actually doing.",
      "In some cases, the extensions appear to do nothing at all when clicked. However, they continue to send data in the background. For instance, the Fire Shield Extension Protection remained inactive until the researcher manually triggered it with a specific extension ID.

      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "5 ways to stay safe from sketchy extensions",
      "If you\u2019re worried about the above extensions, here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy.",
      "1)\u00a0Keep your browser up to date: Chrome gets regular updates that get rid of most security issues. Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2) Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",
      "3) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0A good antivirus can warn you before you install malicious software, such as sketchy browser extensions. It can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping keep your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask, \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5) Change your passwords and do it safely: If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via Chrome\u2019s built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer, where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then consider switching to a\u00a0password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward. I\u2019ve reviewed the top options in my\u00a0best password managers of 2025 guide. See which one fits your needs best.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The fact that several of these extensions carried Google\u2019s own \"Featured\" badge should serve as a wake-up call. It points to a serious lapse in oversight and raises concerns about how thorough Chrome\u2019s extension review process actually is. When millions of users unknowingly install spyware under the impression that it has been vetted and approved, the issue is no longer just about bad actors. It reflects a deeper failure within the platform itself. Google needs to take stronger responsibility by improving transparency and tightening its review standards.",

It\u2019s one of the first truly autonomous AI agents, able to do its own research, make decisions and even carry out plans, all with barely any human oversight.",
      "Sounds impressive, right? But here\u2019s the thing: While all this innovation opens up exciting possibilities, it also brings some serious privacy and security questions.

      "Your data could be used to train AI, even if you go nowhere near it",
      "This has already been happening for a while with other AI models. There have been\u00a0several class-action lawsuits against tech companies for scraping personal data for\u00a0use in AI training, with one lawsuit claiming that OpenAI uses \"stolen private information, including personally identifiable information, from hundreds of millions of internet users, including children of all ages, without their informed knowledge or consent.\"",
      "Many companies also sell or share data with third parties, including for the purposes of AI training. For example, X has been using personal data to train its AI, Grok, and is also sharing user data with third parties to train AI models. So whether you use AI (including\u00a0Manus AI when it\u2019s released to the public) or not, there\u2019s still a good chance that they have your personal information.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "GOOGLE'S NEW AI TECH MAY KNOW WHEN YOUR HOUSE WILL BURN DOWN",
      "Why should you care if AI has your data?",
      "It boils down to data privacy and security. When AI companies collect personal information \u2013 things like your name, email address, home location, social media posts and even photos \u2013 they often store it in large databases to train their models. If those databases aren\u2019t properly secured, they can become gold mines for hackers. Think of them as digital \"honey pots\": sweet and tempting to cybercriminals because of all the personal data inside.",
      "This isn\u2019t just a theoretical risk. Just this year, another AI company,\u00a0DeepSeek, experienced a major leak that exposed more than a million sensitive records. When this kind of information gets out, it can end up on the dark web where scammers and identity thieves are more than happy to scoop it up. That\u2019s how people end up dealing with everything from identity theft and impersonation to tons of spam calls, phishing emails and targeted scams.",
      "But data leaks aren\u2019t the only danger. Even when the information is secure, it can be misused or manipulated in ways that are hard to detect. One of the biggest new threats is something called a prompt injection attack.",
      "In simple terms, prompt injection is a way for attackers to trick an AI into doing something it wasn\u2019t supposed to. Researchers recently found that attackers can embed hidden commands in seemingly harmless text, like a website bio, email signature or even a social media post. When the AI reads that text during training or browsing, it can accidentally follow the hidden instructions, which might tell it to leak information, change how it behaves or give unauthorized access to private data.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DANGERS OF OVER-SHARING WITH AI TOOLS",
      "Manus AI poses even bigger risks",
      "Unlike most AI tools that respond to commands you give them directly, Manus is autonomous, meaning it can act on its own, follow links, read content and make decisions without human approval. While that sounds pretty cool, it\u2019s also what makes it a lot harder to spot when something goes wrong.",
      "If Manus encounters malicious content, it could unknowingly follow a hidden prompt, compromise your data or alter its behavior, and there may be no obvious sign that anything has happened until it\u2019s too late. There are also some concerns about where Manus sends and stores data. Security researchers have traced data back to servers in Shenzhen, China, raising red flags about surveillance, jurisdiction and who might ultimately have access to your information.",
      "So even if Manus isn\u2019t scraping anything too sensitive today, the combination of weak oversight, powerful automation and questionable data practices makes it far riskier than your average AI assistant.",

      "So, how can you protect yourself?",
      "As I\u2019ve mentioned, whether you use Manus AI or not, your personal information will still likely end up in its datasets, so the best way to protect yourself is to make your information difficult to find. Here are some things you can do.",
      "1) Be cautious about using Manus: With that level of autonomy, especially since it\u2019s a very new AI (not to mention the inconsistency in its privacy policy regarding governance), I wouldn\u2019t recommend using it quite yet. There\u2019s just too much damage it can do if it malfunctions or is subject to a prompt injection attack.",
      "2) Keep your personal information under wraps: With so many companies selling and trading personal information, many of them to tech companies to train AI, it\u2019s a good idea to withhold your data unless you absolutely can\u2019t avoid sharing it.",
      "3) Actively remove your personal information from the internet so your data can\u2019t be scraped by AI models like Manus: Set your social media to private, limit data collection through privacy settings and remove your information from data brokers and people-search sites. Autonomous cloud-based agents such as Manus are designed to extract and analyze vast amounts of online data, and your publicly available information can be swept into their training datasets without your knowledge or consent.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "4) Use strong antivirus software to help defend against the broader attack surface created by autonomous AI systems: Manus\u2019 ability to act independently and interact with external systems increases the risk of adversarial attacks and malware transmission, so robust endpoint security is essential to protect your devices and data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Use privacy-focused products and services: Whenever you cannot avoid sharing personal information, opt for companies that prioritize your privacy. For example, use the DuckDuckGo browser instead of Chrome and Brave or Proton Mail instead of Gmail.\u00a0Check out the best private and safe browser alternatives to Google.",
      "6) Keep all software updated, including your operating system, browsers and security tools, to patch vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit: As AI agents like Manus operate in the cloud and may interact with your systems, unpatched software can become an easy target for exploitation or unauthorized access. Therefore, it's always a good idea to keep software, operating systems, browsers and security tools\u00a0updated at all times.",
      "7) Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) on all your accounts: As AI-driven attacks and automated data extraction become more common,\u00a0MFA adds a crucial layer of defense, making it much harder for attackers to compromise your accounts, even if an AI system leaks or scrapes your credentials.",
      "8) Use strong, unique passwords for every account: As cloud-based AI agents like Manus can interact with external systems and potentially access sensitive data, unique passwords help prevent a breach of one account from leading to a broader compromise.

      "Flying robots bring precision and efficiency to harvesting",
      "Tevel\u2019s Flying Autonomous Robots (FARs) are redefining fruit harvesting by combining artificial intelligence with advanced computer vision. These drones navigate through orchards, identifying and picking only the fruit that has reached peak ripeness. Their ability to maneuver carefully around branches allows them to harvest without bruising or harming the trees. Unlike human pickers, these drones can operate continuously, working day and night to get the job done faster and more consistently.",
      "Farmers benefit from detailed, real-time information about the harvest, including the size, color and ripeness of each fruit, all accessible through a mobile app. This data helps optimize harvesting schedules and reduce waste. FARs have already been deployed in orchards across the United States, Italy, Chile and Israel, where they have helped reduce labor costs by up to 30% while improving harvest accuracy. Multiple drones work together from a mobile platform, covering large orchard areas efficiently.",

      "If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from covering data breaches over the years, it\u2019s that you should never take a company\u2019s initial numbers at face value. When a breach becomes public, most companies try to minimize the damage by reporting fewer victims or staying vague about what kind of data was exposed.",
      "Sometimes, to be fair, they genuinely don\u2019t have the full picture yet. But that rarely gets communicated clearly. The same thing just happened again with an insurtech company that has now doubled the number of people affected by a breach it disclosed last year.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Texas-based insurance administrative services provider Landmark Admin has revised the scope of its May 2024 cyberattack, revealing that nearly twice as many people were impacted as initially reported. Back in October 2024, Landmark disclosed that suspicious activity was detected in its network on May 13, prompting an investigation. At the time,\u00a0it was estimated that the breach affected 806,519 individuals. But in a recent update filed with the Maine Attorney General\u2019s office, that number has now jumped to 1,613,773.",
      "Landmark serves as a third-party administrator offering backend support to major insurers like Liberty Bankers Life and American Benefit Life. This means millions of sensitive insurance policy records flow through its systems, making it a tempting target for cybercriminals.",
      "The compromised information varies for each individual but may include a wide range of sensitive personal data. This includes full names, home addresses, Social Security numbers, tax identification numbers, driver's license or state-issued identification numbers, passport numbers and bank account details. In some cases, medical information, dates of birth, health insurance policy numbers and details related to life and annuity policies may also have been exposed.",

      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from insurance data breach",
      "If your information was part of the Landmark breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1) Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Landmark data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised. They often include up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team in which a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2) Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Landmark data breach revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud.",
      "3) Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Landmark hackers obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",
      "4) Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.\u00a0One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Landmark hackers have people's email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you're not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The real risk with breaches like this isn't just the initial leak. It's the slow drip of consequences that follow. As more names and numbers surface, the fallout becomes harder to contain, and the people impacted are left scrambling to protect themselves. Landmark\u2019s delayed clarity is a reminder that in the world of cyberattacks, timelines rarely work in the public\u2019s favor. By the time the full picture emerges, the damage may already be done.",

      "\u200b\u200bImagine powering your boat not with gasoline but with clean hydrogen fuel. That\u2019s exactly what Yamaha, together with Roush Industries and Regulator Marine, is working on right now. They\u2019re developing the world\u2019s first hydrogen-combustion outboard engine, aiming to make boating greener and more sustainable.",

      "Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The big, big moment: First hydrogen fill-up",
      "To reach their goal, a specially modified Regulator Marine 26XO boat was taken to a hydrogen fueling station. The team filled its tanks with hydrogen for the very first time, which was a huge milestone. This 26-foot boat runs on a tweaked version of Yamaha\u2019s powerful 450hp XTO outboard engine, but instead of gasoline, it\u2019s fueled by gaseous hydrogen.",
      "Matt Van Benschoten from Roush, who\u2019s been deeply involved in the project, called it\u00a0\"a big moment.\" He handled the tricky job of designing and integrating the hydrogen fuel system, making sure everything was safe and worked smoothly.",

      "RIDE THE WAVES WITH THE MOST ADVANCED WAKE BOAT EVER",
      "What\u2019s different about this hydrogen outboard?",
      "Yamaha started with their largest offshore outboard, the XTO 450, and made some smart changes to handle hydrogen. They adjusted parts like the cylinder heads, fuel lines and injectors to work with hydrogen\u2019s unique properties. But most of the engine is still the same as the gasoline version.",
      "The boat itself was modified to fit three high-pressure hydrogen tanks, each holding fuel at 700 bar (that\u2019s super-high pressure). These tanks are designed to expand as they fill up, so Yamaha\u2019s engineers had to come up with clever mounting solutions that let the tanks move a bit without causing problems. Though Yamaha hasn't disclosed the gasoline equivalency of the hydrogen tanks, they are striving to achieve optimal capacity for marine industry applications.",

      "4-LEGGED HYDROGEN-POWERED ROBOT YOU CAN ACTUALLY RIDE",
      "Safety first: Smart systems on board",
      "Safety is a huge focus here. The boat uses a standard hydrogen refueling connector and follows strict protocols to make sure filling up is safe and efficient. There\u2019s even tank monitoring feedback between the boat and the fueling station that monitors tank conditions and can stop refueling if things get too hot.",
      "Inside the boat, multiple hydrogen detectors keep an eye on gas levels. If hydrogen starts to build up, the system alerts the captain. If it gets too high, the engine shuts down and vents the gas safely. Plus, Roush designed a special ventilation system to make sure any leaked hydrogen escapes from the highest points on the boat, since hydrogen is lighter than air and rises.",

They\u2019ve built two boats so far: one for display and one for real-world testing. Now, the team is focused on fine-tuning the system, running safety tests and figuring out how far the boat can go on a tank of hydrogen. They\u2019re also working on making refueling faster and more convenient.",
      "Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Challenges and possibilities of hydrogen technology",
      "Right now, the tanks are cylindrical and take up a lot of space, limiting how much hydrogen the boat can carry. However, in the future, Yamaha hopes to use other tank alternatives to integrate more efficiently and fit better inside the boat hull. Finding the right parts for these super-high-pressure hydrogen systems isn\u2019t easy either; the supply chain is still catching up. However, with partners like Roush and Regulator Marine, Yamaha is pushing through these challenges.",
      "And it\u2019s not stopping there. Yamaha recently acquired electric outboard maker Torqeedo, showing they\u2019re serious about exploring all kinds of clean marine propulsion technologies.",
      "Ben Speciale, president of Yamaha's U.S. Marine Business Unit, tells Cyberguy, \"Our hydrogen outboard concept is on the water now, and we\u2019re learning more about how to optimize its performance every day. We believe a multiple-technology solution is the best way to achieve cleaner products on the water, and hydrogen represents one of those pathways within our product line. We\u2019re optimistic about the future of hydrogen in the marine industry, and we look forward to sharing specific performance data as it becomes available.\"",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says an Apple Watch saved psychiatrist Amanda Faulkner by detecting deadly leukemia early.",
      "In recent years, smartwatches have gone far beyond just telling the time or tracking steps. These little gadgets on our wrists are becoming powerful health tools, quietly monitoring our bodies and sometimes even alerting us to serious medical issues before we realize something\u2019s wrong. From tracking heart rate and sleep patterns to measuring blood oxygen levels, smartwatches are helping people stay more in tune with their health than ever before.",

      "The life-saving power of wearable technology",
      "Take Amanda Faulkner\u2019s story, for example. Amanda, a consultant psychiatrist from New Zealand, was feeling unusually tired and hot one summer, but she just put it down to the heat or maybe perimenopause. She was busy with over 60 patients and didn\u2019t think much of it. But her new\u00a0Apple Watch kept sending alerts that her resting heart rate was way higher than normal, jumping from her usual 55 beats per minute up into the 90s.",
      "At first, she thought the watch was wrong. She was fit and healthy, after all, and she had even recently been hiking. However, the notifications kept coming every morning, and eventually Amanda decided to see her GP. That decision probably saved her life.",
      "Within hours of tests, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, a rare and aggressive blood cancer. Doctors told her that if she had waited another 48 hours, she might not have survived.",

      "HOW TO CHECK YOUR HEARTBEAT WITH THE EKG APP ON YOUR APPLE WATCH",
      "The wider impact of Amanda\u2019s story",
      "Amanda\u2019s experience shows just how powerful these wearable devices can be, not as medical diagnosis tools but as early warning systems that encourage people to seek help sooner. Apple, for instance, is clear that its heart monitoring features aren\u2019t meant to replace doctors but to provide useful information that can prompt users to get checked out. Elevated heart rates can signal many things, from infections to allergic reactions, and catching these signs early can make all the difference.",
      "Amanda's husband, Mike, told us, \"The positive press from this story has also led to many friends and family members deciding to act on health concerns and/or buy an\u00a0Apple Watch, and I have seen many similar comments on social media where the post has been replicated. She has also had complete strangers come to see her in the hospital to discuss their own cancer journeys, and as Amanda cannot work in her role as a psychiatrist, these interactions have been great, allowing Amanda to \u2018help\u2019 people again, which, after all, is her vocation in life.\"",
      "Amanda remains in treatment, including chemotherapy and an upcoming stem cell transplant, but she remains optimistic and grateful for the smartwatch that gave her a fighting chance. She urges others, especially women who often have their symptoms dismissed, to trust their instincts and advocate for their health.",

      "HOW TO MONITOR BLOOD PRESSURE WITH YOUR APPLE WATCH",
      "Limitations and risks of smartwatch health monitoring",
      "While smartwatches offer incredible benefits, it\u2019s important to recognize their limitations. These devices are not medical-grade tools and can sometimes produce false positives or miss critical health issues. Overreliance on smartwatch data may lead to unnecessary anxiety or, conversely, false reassurance. Additionally, not everyone\u2019s body responds the same way, and factors like skin tone, movement or device placement can affect accuracy. Privacy and data security are also concerns, as sensitive health information is transmitted and stored digitally. It\u2019s essential to view smartwatches as supplementary tools that can prompt users to seek professional medical advice rather than definitive diagnoses.",

      "Smartwatches are more than just tech accessories; they\u2019re becoming essential health companions. While they don\u2019t replace professional medical advice, their ability to monitor vital signs continuously and alert users to potential problems is transforming how we approach health. Amanda Faulkner\u2019s story is a powerful reminder that sometimes the smallest devices can make the biggest difference, literally saving lives by catching warning signs early. So, if your smartwatch starts \"nagging\" you about your health, it might just be worth paying attention to it.",

This often involves selling stolen information to scammers or hackers who use it for fraudulent activities, such as running credit fraud schemes. Since many forms of identity theft revolve around credit accounts, it\u2019s crucial to take action if your or a loved one\u2019s personal data has been exposed.",
      "One of the most effective ways to prevent credit fraud is by placing a security freeze on your credit accounts. A security freeze stops anyone from opening new accounts, issuing new cards or conducting any credit-related activities in your name while the freeze is in place.",
      "If managing this process feels overwhelming, consider using an identity theft protection service. These services can handle placing and managing security freezes on your behalf, saving you time and ensuring the process is done correctly. Many of these services also offer additional features, such as credit monitoring and alerts, to help you stay on top of potential threats to your personal information. Taking this step can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind that your financial information is secure.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "A fraud alert is an extra layer of protection for your credit accounts. Like a credit freeze, you can set it up with all three credit bureaus.",

      "Cybercriminals are constantly finding new ways to steal your data. As people become more aware of common threats like phishing links, fake websites, fraudulent emails and impersonation scams, attackers are becoming more creative in their approach.",
      "One of the newer methods they are using involves targeting USB flash drives. It may seem surprising that they would focus on something as simple as a flash drive, but the data it holds can be valuable.",
      "Plus, flash drives can be used to spread malware to other devices.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "Person plugging USB flash drive into laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why target USB flash drives?",
      "USB drives are ubiquitous in workplaces, especially in environments with air-gapped systems or restricted internet access, such as those in government and energy sectors. This makes them an easy target for data theft and malware propagation. Often, these drives store sensitive files that are not available on networked systems.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "When infected, USB drives can spread\u00a0malware not just within a single organization but also across multiple entities if shared. These attacks don\u2019t rely on network vulnerabilities, allowing them to bypass traditional security tools.",
      "USB flash drive plugged into laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "How hackers are targeting your USB drives",
      "As reported by\u00a0Kaspersky's Securelist, a cybersecurity research platform, hackers are using USB drives to spread malware in ways that can easily bypass traditional security systems. One group, known as GOFFEE, kicks off its attacks with targeted phishing emails. These emails often carry infected RAR files or Office documents with harmful macros. Once opened, they install sneaky programs like PowerModul and PowerTaskel on the victim\u2019s system.",
      "These tools don\u2019t just sit around. They lay the groundwork for more attacks. PowerModul, in particular, plays a big role. It\u2019s a PowerShell script introduced in 2024 that talks to a command-and-control server. From there, it can download and run other tools, including two especially dangerous ones, FlashFileGrabber and USB Worm.",
      "FlashFileGrabber is made to steal data from USB drives. It can either save stolen files locally or send them back to the hacker's server. Then there\u2019s USB Worm, which infects any USB drive it finds with PowerModul, turning that drive into a tool for spreading malware to other systems.",
      "What makes this method effective is that USB drives are often shared between people and offices. That physical movement allows the malware to spread even without an internet connection. The malware hides original files on the USB and replaces them with malicious scripts disguised as normal-looking shortcuts. When someone clicks one of these, they unknowingly trigger the infection.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "A hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "4 practical ways to stay safe from USB-targeted attacks",
      "1. Don\u2019t plug in unknown USB drives:\u00a0It might sound obvious, but this is one of the most common ways malware spreads. If you find a USB drive lying around or someone gives you one you weren\u2019t expecting, avoid plugging it into your system. Attackers often rely on human curiosity to get the malware onto your machine.",
      "2.\u00a0Be extra cautious with email attachments:\u00a0GOFFEE\u2019s campaigns often begin with phishing emails carrying malicious RAR files or Office documents with macros. Always double-check the sender\u2019s address and never open unexpected attachments, especially if they ask you to \"enable macros\" or come from unknown contacts. When in doubt, confirm through a different channel.",
      "3. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many attacks like GOFFEE\u2019s start with emails that look legitimate but contain malicious links. These links might lead you to fake login pages or silently download malware that sets the stage for USB-targeting tools like PowerModul.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Scan USB drives before use:\u00a0The USB Worm infects USB drives by hiding original files and planting malicious scripts disguised as shortcuts, which trigger PowerModul when clicked. FlashFileGrabber also steals files silently from USBs, often going unnoticed. Always scan USB drives with updated antivirus software before opening any files. Use a reputable security tool to check for hidden scripts, unusual shortcuts or unexpected executables. If files appear renamed or hidden, don\u2019t click them until verified safe.",
      "How to scan a USB flash drive for malware (PC & Mac)",
      "No matter which antivirus tool you use, it\u2019s essential to scan USB flash drives as soon as you plug them in. Here\u2019s how to do it on both platforms:",
      "For Windows PC",
      "Insert your USB flash drive into your computer",
      "Open your installed antivirus software",
      "Look for a\u00a0Custom Scan or\u00a0Scan Specific Drive option",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Cybercriminals thrive where convenience meets oversight. However, it\u2019s worth considering why USBs remain such a soft target. They\u2019re not just storage but a cultural artifact of workplaces, especially in high-stakes sectors like energy or government, where offline data transfer feels safer than the cloud. But that trust is a blind spot. Attackers like GOFFEE don\u2019t need zero days because they can exploit human habits such as sharing drives, skipping scans and clicking without thinking.",

    "story": [
      "Catholic Connection radio show host Teresa Tomeo describes the emotional reaction to Pope Francis' procession moving his casket to St. Peter's Basilica.",
      "Cardinal Robert Sarah \u2013 championed by conservatives as reflecting the doctrinaire and liturgically minded papacies of Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI \u2013 is among those being considered to replace Pope Francis.",
      "An African cardinal from Guinea, Sarah, 79, is viewed as a spiritual and theological standard-bearer for conservative Catholics, as critics of Francis have argued the late pope was too heavily influenced by modern secularism.",
      "Sarah previously headed the Vatican\u2019s charity office Cor Unum and clashed with Francis on many occasions.",
      "Their ideological divide most seriously came to a head when Sarah and Benedict \u2013 who retired as acting pope in 2013 \u2013 co-authored a book titled \"From the Depths of Our Hearts: Priesthood, Celibacy and the Crisis of the Catholic Church.\" The 2020 book advocated the \"necessity\" of continued celibacy for Latin Rite priests and came out as Francis was weighing whether to allow married priests in the Amazon to address a priest shortage there.",

      "As a result, Francis dismissed Benedict\u2019s secretary, Archbishop Georg Gaenswein, from his papal household job, and several months later retired Sarah after he turned 75. The prospect of a retired pope trying to influence a reigning one created the scenario that canon lawyers and theologians had warned of when Benedict decided to retain the white cassock of the papacy in retirement as \"pope emeritus.\" The scandal died down after Benedict removed himself as a co-author.",
      "It's actually Sarah's 2019 book that's causing more of a stir with conservative Christians in the wake of Francis' passing.",
      "Sarah has described \"The Day Is Now Far Spent\" as his most significant book. In it, the cardinal decries how Europe and Western civilization have turned away from Christianity and suffer from ideological challenges brought by mass migration.",
      "By contrast, Francis had openly contradicted the Trump administration and Vice President JD Vance \u2013 a Catholic convert \u2013 over their crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Vance, one of the last dignitaries to meet with Francis on Easter Sunday before his passing, has referenced Pope John Paul II \u2013 ideologically more similar to Sarah \u2013 in recent public addresses. At the Munich Security Conference, Vance praised John Paul II as \"one of the most extraordinary champions of democracy\" when emphasizing the importance of Western values. The vice president also celebrated John Paul II's call for new evangelization at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C.",
      "Sarah co-authored two other books \u2013 \"God or Nothing: A Conversation on Faith\" in 2015 and The Power of Silence: Against the Dictatorship of Noise in 2017 \u2013 both with French journalist Nicolas Diat.",
      "Here are some key quotes by Sarah being highlighted ahead of Francis' funeral later this week. The papal conclave will convene in the coming weeks to choose a new leader of the Catholic Church.",
      "1. The West cut itself off from its 'Christian roots\u2019",
      "Sarah argued that the West has cut itself off from its Christian heritage in \"The Day is Now Far Spent.\"",

      "\"The West no longer knows who it is, because it no longer knows and does not want to know who made it, who established it, as it was and as it is. The West refuses to acknowledge its Christian roots.\"",
      "\"By losing its faith, Europe has also lost its reason to be. It is experiencing a lethal decline and is becoming a new civilization, one that is cut off from its Christian roots.\"\u200b",
      "VANCE WAS ONE OF POPE FRANCIS' LAST VISITORS",
      "2. Gender ideology is \u2018Luciferian\u2019",
      "Sarah argued that gender ideology is an affront to God's creation and cannot fundamentally change whether a person is male or female in \"The Day is Now Far Spent.\"",
      "\"Gender ideology is a Luciferian refusal to receive a sexual nature from God.\"",
      "3. Called mass migration a \u2018new form of slavery\u2019",
      "In a March 2019 interview with the French publication \"Valeurs Actuelles,\" Sarah reportedly criticized the role of the Catholic Church in supporting mass migration policies in Europe, noting the harm caused to the migrants themselves.",
      "\"All migrants who arrive in Europe are penniless, without work, without dignity,\" Sarah reportedly said. \"This is what the Church wants? The Church cannot cooperate with this new form of slavery that has become mass migration.\"\u200b",

      "5. Calls Christians to refuse loyalty to popularity or politics",
      "In \"God or Nothing: A Conversation on Faith,\" Sarah asserts that one's loyalty must be to Christ \u2013 rather than to popularity or politics \u2013 and repeatedly argues against moral relativism in family and societal norms.",

      "\"Simply because Trump hasn\u2019t announced any consequences yet does not mean that he doesn\u2019t plan on taking some anti-Russia measures,\" former DIA intelligence officer and Russia expert Rebekah Koffler told Fox News Digital. \"Trump almost certainly intends for his economic warfare against China to serve as an example to Putin how far Trump is willing to go to compel his adversaries to his will.\"",
      "\"But unlike the China case, there\u2019s no similar dependence between the U.S. and Russia. Trump\u2019s decision on Russia is much more complicated, more risky and requires more thought,\" she added. \"He may or may not take draconian economic steps against Russia, as Putin may take devastating, non-kinetic actions against the U.S.",
      "\"It\u2019s Trump\u2019s risk tolerance vs. Putin\u2019s now,\" Koffler said. \"And both like to win and both have risk tolerance way above average.\"",

      "\"If we want to be a global superpower, and we want to deter aggression, not with U.S. troops on the ground, but in general, to deter aggression \u2013 including potentially with China against Taiwan \u2013 because it is good for our national security, then we should think about good options to continue to support Ukraine,\" former CIA Moscow Station Chief Dan Hoffman told Fox News Digital. \"It's a tiny percentage of the Department of Defense budget.\"",

      "\"Its Ukraine's war of self-defense but its in our interest to deter Putin just as we did with his Soviet predecessors,\" Hoffman said. \"If our goal is to break Putin's alliance with Iran, North Korea and China, then the best way to do it is to prove that Putin's war on Ukraine is a loser for him.\"",

      "The Kremlin\u2019s position has given credence to repeated warnings from security experts that Putin is not interested in securing a peace deal with Ukraine.",
      "\"There's no indication that Putin wants to stop the war,\" Hoffman said. \"That isn't surprising. Because for a war to end, somebody has to win or both sides have to be so tired they can't continue to fight.",
      "\"Russia is the invader, so you have to stop them in order to have an end of the war,\" he added. \"The one consistent thing here is Putin is continuing to fight. His objective is to overthrow the government in Ukraine. He\u2019s going to keep fighting until he feels like he has accomplished that goal or he can't fight anymore.\"",

      "\"He could promise Trump not to share certain sensitive technologies to these two [nations],\" Koffler said. \"And he could convince Iran not to operationalize and weaponize its nuclear program in exchange for Trump\u2019s promise not to target Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in a kinetic strike and to lift sanctions from Russia.",
      "\"The important aspect of all of this is to give these adversaries face-saving opportunities, which is not a strong point for the U.S. style of diplomacy,\" Koffler said. \"But Putin\u2019s ability to convince Trump and Trump\u2019s decision calculus are two different things.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 20:09:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been focusing more on public and television appearances so he can speak directly to President Trump through the appearances.",
    "story": [
      "Pete Hegseth wants\u00a0Donald Trump to see him as a fighter amid the negative stories swirling around the defense secretary, two U.S. officials told NBC News, and has been focusing more on public and television appearances\u00a0\u2014 including on his old network, Fox News \u2014 in which\u00a0he can\u00a0speak directly\u00a0to\u00a0the president.",
      "Trump had told Hegseth during a recent phone call that he did not approve of his texting information about airstrikes in Yemen to a Signal group that included Hegseth\u2019s wife, his brother and his personal attorney, describing what the defense secretary had done as childish, one U.S. official and another person familiar with the conversation said. The call ended with Trump telling Hegseth to keep fighting, however.",
      "As he battles to keep his job amid a flood of reports about his behavior and infighting in his Pentagon, Hegseth\u2019s behavior has\u00a0become\u00a0\u201cerratic,\u201d\u00a0and he\u00a0seems increasingly\u00a0\u201cinsecure\u201d\u00a0about his job and standing in the administration, leading him to frequently reinforce to staff that he can\u2019t allow himself to be fired, according to  two officials familiar with the situation.",
      "Officials who operate in Hegseth\u2019s vicinity describe him as difficult and prickly, and said that he berates and yells at the staff. The officials described a tense environment with fighting, even yelling, among Hegseth\u2019s senior staff.",
      "Last month, Hegseth was furious about leaks of his having approved a military briefing for Elon Musk on China, according to multiple defense officials. When officials found out The New York Times was preparing to report the meeting, Hegseth screamed at\u00a0Adm. Chris Grady, the\u00a0acting chairman\u00a0of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, saying he\u00a0would \u201cf---ing\u00a0polygraph\u201d him to find out if he leaked the information about the meeting, according to three U.S. officials familiar with the meeting. Hegseth staffers also threatened to polygraph\u00a0Adm. Sam Paparo, the commander of U.S. IndoPacific Command, and Lt. Gen D.A. Sims, the director of the Joint Staff, the officials said, and told the Joint Chiefs who had access to information\u00a0about the Musk briefing and the agenda that they would be subject to polygraphs, the officials said.",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report that Hegseth yelled at Grady and threatened him with a polygraph.",
      "As he deals with questions about his job performance, his handling of sensitive information and how long he\u2019ll be able to hold on, Hegseth has had a significantly diminished staff around him.",
      "Last week,\u00a0three officials\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Hegseth; Darin Selnick, Hegseth\u2019s deputy chief of staff; and Colin Carroll, chief of staff to Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg \u2014 were all told they were implicated in a leak investigation, placed on administrative leave and escorted from the Pentagon. They were not given specifics about the allegations against them but all were terminated last Friday.",
      "They released a joint statement the next day\u00a0in which they said,\u00a0\u201cWe are incredibly disappointed by the manner in which our service at the Department of Defense ended. Unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door.\u201d They went on to call the experience \u201cunconscionable,\u201d but said they continue to support the Trump-Vance administration, without referencing any support for Hegseth.",
      "Days after being fired,\u00a0Selnick and Caldwell\u00a0were both exonerated. It\u2019s not clear if Carroll was, as well.",
      "In another sudden staff shake-up, Hegseth\u2019s chief of staff, Joe Kasper, also left his role last week. On Monday, a senior defense official provided this statement to NBC News: \u201cJoe\u00a0Kasper\u00a0will continue to serve President Trump as a Special Government Employee (SGE) handling special projects at the Department of Defense. Secretary Hegseth is thankful for his continued leadership and work to advance the America First agenda.\u201d",
      "During a Fox News interview Tuesday, Hegseth was asked whether Kasper has a new role. \u201cHe\u2019s staying with us, going to be in a slightly different role, but he\u2019s not going anywhere, certainly not fired. You make changes over time, and we\u2019re grateful for everything Joe\u2019s done.\u201d",
      "On Friday, the Pentagon announced that Hegseth had tapped four officials who'd already been working in the building to support him in what\u2019s known as the front office. That includes Justin Fulcher, Patrick Weaver and Ricky Buria as senior advisers. Sean Parnell, who has been serving as the assistant to the defense secretary for public affairs and chief Pentagon spokesman, is now also a senior adviser. No individual had been identified as Hegseth\u2019s chief of staff.",
      "\u201cRegular workforce adjustments are a feature of any highly efficient organization,\u201d the Pentagon\u2019s acting press secretary, Kingsley Wilson, said in a statement. \u201cSecretary Hegseth will continue to be proactive with personnel decisions and will work hard to ensure the Department of Defense has the right people in the right positions to execute President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, revelations about Hegseth\u2019s use of Signal and potential security risks he\u2019s creating with it have not stopped coming. The latest is that Hegseth had a special internet line installed in his Pentagon office in defiance of the Defense Department\u2019s normal security protocols so that he could use the Signal app on a personal computer there, according to two officials\u00a0familiar with the matter.",
      "The so-called \u201cdirty\u201d line, referred to that way because it\u2019s not secured, increases the likelihood of the office being hacked or surveilled by a foreign adversary or another entity because it doesn\u2019t have the same security filters as other, highly secure lines in and out of the office. Hegseth\u2019s office is considered a SCIF, or sensitive, compartmentalized information facility, which is specially designed to protect communications.\u00a0\u00a0The existence of the line was first reported by The Associated Press on Thursday."

    "story": [
      "Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student\u00a0who faces deportation, was detained without an arrest warrant last month, according to court documents released Thursday.",
      "Khalil, a Syrian-born legal resident and green card holder, was arrested on March 8 after returning from an Iftar meal during Ramadan. In court documents, Department of Homeland Security attorneys state that the immigration officers \"had exigent circumstances to conduct the warrantless arrest\" and that Khalil said he would not cooperate and intended to leave the scene.",
      "Federal immigration authorities said they \"believed there was a flight risk and arrest was necessary,\u201d according to the court documents.",
      "Video footage of the arrest\u00a0shows Khalil cooperating with officers and telling them, \"Yes, I'm coming with you.\"",
      "He remains in custody at an immigration detention facility in Louisiana.",
      "Khalil's wife, Noor Abdalla, who\u00a0announced the birth\u00a0of the couple\u2019s first child on Monday, said in a statement three days after the arrest that ICE agents told her they had a warrant to revoke his student visa. When informed he didn't need one, they replied that they were there to revoke his green card, Khalil's attorneys previously said.",
      "DHS argued in court documents submitted to the court on Thursday that it did not need to obtain a warrant before the arrest because immigration officers have the power to detain people where there is suspicion of \u201can offense against the United States.\u201d",
      "\"The HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] supervisory agent believed there was a flight risk and arrest was necessary,\" the DHS wrote. \"The agents had reason to believe that the respondent was likely to escape before a warrant could be obtained,\" it continued.",
      "Previously, DHS attorneys filed Khalil\u2019s arrest report in immigration court, which stated that federal immigration authorities informed Khalil that they had a warrant for his arrest. At that time, he asked if he could contact his lawyer when they approached him in March.",
      "Khalil\u2019s attorneys, however, argue DHS did need a warrant to enter their client's apartment building. Khalil's legal team is calling for the case against him to be dismissed, claiming that he cooperated with authorities throughout the arrest and that no evidence has been presented to prove he was a flight risk.",
      "\"We learned for the first time that the DHS agents who arrested Mahmoud lied to him:\u00a0they wrote in their arrest report that the agents told him that they had an arrest warrant, but DHS has now admitted in their filing that that was a lie and that there was no warrant at all at the time\u00a0of the arrest,\" Marc Van Der Hout,\u00a0one of Khalil\u2019s attorneys, said in a statement.",
      "The Department of Justice and ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Friday in an emailed statement: \"Khalil was encountered by ICE officers and identified as a removable alien. When he tried to walk away, he was arrested. An administrative arrest warrant was executed at the time of his booking as is the custom.\"",
      "Khalil\u2019s case has gained international attention as the Trump administration seeks to deport several students accused of jeopardizing their immigration status by supporting groups designated as foreign terrorist entities, such as Hamas, in some instances without providing evidence.",
      "Documents released Thursday also show that Khalil has submitted an asylum application after an immigration judge ruled this month that he could be deported.",
      "The Trump administration has advanced two grounds for Khalil\u2019s removal from the U.S. since his arrest on March 8 in New York City. Khalil is currently detained in a Louisiana detention facility.",
      "The government first cited a provision in immigration law that gives the secretary of state the authority to deport someone if it is determined that the person \"would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "The most recent argument, which the government made public on March 23, alleges that Khalil withheld information about his membership in certain organizations and failed to disclose his employment at the Syria Office in the British Embassy in Beirut in his permanent residency application.",
      "Khalil\u2019s attorneys also submitted additional evidence to the court countering allegations of antisemitism, including letters from multiple Jewish classmates and professors at Columbia University who said Khalil condemned Hamas, de-escalated tense situations on campus and supported Jewish students.",
      "The graduate student's attorneys also denied allegations that\u00a0Khalil\u00a0failed to disclose his employment history and involvement in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest on his permanent residency application.",
      "NBC News previously reported that these allegations against Khalil were partially based on unverified tabloid news reports.",
      "Thursday's filings were in response to a deadline the day before set by the immigration judge in Khalil\u2019s removal case in Louisiana.",
      "In his separate federal case, which challenges his detention, the judge requested that copies of the filings be submitted to the court, where they were made public. Khalil's asylum application is sealed \"due to the sensitive nature of the information that could affect his safety in the future,\" his legal team said.",
      "In federal court, Khalil is still seeking bail and a preliminary injunction that would release him from custody while his immigration case proceeds."

      "President Donald Trump said in a new interview that he was joking when he promised to end the Russia-Ukraine war in the first 24 hours of his second term.",
      "Trump also said Chinese President Xi Jinping has called him about tariffs, and he addressed the Supreme Court's order that his administration work to facilitate the release of Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia from an El Salvador prison.",
      "Those were just some of the areas the president touched upon in a wide-ranging interview with Time magazine to mark his first 100 days in office, which has been consumed by efforts to reshape the federal government, push the limits of presidential power and bring about an economic sea change through sweeping tariffs. A transcript of the interview was published Friday.",
      "Ending the war in Ukraine",
      "Trump told Time that he was speaking \"figuratively\" when he promised to end the Ukraine-Russia war on the first day of his second term.",
      "\"Well, I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point,\" Trump said.",
      "\"Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended,\" he added.",
      "Trump said repeatedly on the campaign trail that he would end the war within his first 24 hours in office. But that promise never came to fruition, and he has conveyed that negotiations have been more difficult than expected.",
      "\"The war has been raging for three years,\" he told Time. \"I just got here, and you say, what\u2019s taken so long?\"",
      "The president also said he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin would \"rather go and take the whole thing\" when it comes to Ukraine's territory, although he said Thursday that Russia has conceded that it cannot do so.",
      "In the interview with Time, which took place Tuesday, Trump said, \"Crimea will stay with Russia. And Zelensky understands that, and everybody understands that it\u2019s been with them for a long time. It\u2019s been with them long before Trump came along.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters on Thursday, however, Trump stopped short of saying Russia would keep control of Crimea, saying only that it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d for Ukraine to get the peninsula back.  Russia took control of Crimea during the Obama administration, which Trump has falsely claimed President Barack Obama gave to Russia.",
      "Trump also told Time that he doesn't think Ukraine will ever be able to join NATO and that its government's aspirations to join the alliance provoked Russia. \"That\u2019s, I think, what caused the war to start was when they started talking about joining NATO. If that weren\u2019t brought up, there would have been a much better chance that it wouldn\u2019t have started.\"",
      "Phone call with Xi",
      "Trump said in the interview that China's Xi called him about tariffs, though he didn't provide any details about when their conversation took place. NBC News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "\"He's called,\" Trump said, \"And I don't think that's a sign of weakness on his behalf.\"",
      "Asked what Xi said to him, Trump said, \"We all want to make deals. But I am this giant store. It\u2019s a giant, beautiful store, and everybody wants to go shopping there. And on behalf of the American people, I own the store, and I set prices, and I\u2019ll say, if you want to shop here, this is what you have to pay.\"",
      "The Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C.,\u00a0declined Friday to comment on any call between Xi and Trump.",
      "As part of his new tariff policy, Trump has imposed duties of 145% on Chinese imports. Trump said earlier this week that the U.S. is \"actively\" speaking to China about the trade war, but Beijing on Thursday denied that there have been talks. \u201cChina and the U.S. have not engaged in any consultations or negotiations regarding tariffs, let alone reached an agreement,\" a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said.",
      "Trade deals?",
      "Trump claimed in the Time interview that he has \"made 200 deals\" when it comes to tariffs, but there's no evidence that any agreement has been presented so far. His goal has been to broker trade agreements with 75 countries in less than 90 days.",
      "Asked to clarify his comment that he has made 200 deals, Trump said, \u201c100%.\u201d The president was then asked to share with whom these deals have been made and gave a long answer about his tariff plans without naming any country.",
      "Trump said that the deals would be announced \"over the next three to four weeks, and we\u2019re finished, by the way.\u201d",
      "\"I'll be finished,\" the president added when asked again to clarify what he meant. \"Now, some countries may come back and ask for an adjustment, and I\u2019ll consider that. We\u2019re a department store, a giant department store, the biggest department store in history. Everybody wants to come in and take from us. They\u2019re going to come in and they\u2019re going to pay a price for taking our treasure, for taking our jobs, for doing all of these things. But what I\u2019m doing with the tariffs is people are coming in, and they\u2019re building at levels you\u2019ve never seen before.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia case",
      "Trump suggested in the interview that he hasn't been involved in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man whom his administration mistakenly deported to El Salvador, despite the Supreme Court's order that the administration must help \"facilitate\" his return to the U.S.",
      "\"I leave that to my lawyers,\" Trump said when asked if he was helping with Abrego Garcia's release. \"I give them no instructions. They feel that the order said something very much different from what you\u2019re saying. But I leave that to my lawyers. If they want \u2014 and that would be the attorney general of the United States and the people that represent the country. I don\u2019t make that decision.\"",
      "Trump said he hasn't asked El Salvador President Nayib Bukele to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. \"I haven\u2019t been asked to ask him by my attorneys. Nobody asked me to ask him that question, except you,\" Trump said to Time.",
      "The White House has said that Abrego Garcia will \"never\" come back to the U.S., and officials have maintained that he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyers and family have denied.",
      "Asked if he's violating his oath by not obeying a Supreme Court order, Trump said, \"I\u2019m not defying the Supreme Court. I never defy the Supreme Court. I wouldn\u2019t do that. I\u2019m a big believer in the Supreme Court, and have a lot of respect for the Justices.\"",
      "Third term as president",
      "In the Time interview, Trump again discussed the idea of serving a third term as president, which he cannot do under the Constitution.",
      "Trump claimed he hasn't \"looked at even the possibility\" when questioned about his past comments that he might seek another term. But when asked about methods he's previously referred to that could make it possible, he said, \u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss that now, but as you know, there are some loopholes that have been discussed that are well known. But I don\u2019t believe in loopholes. I don\u2019t believe in using loopholes.\u201d",

      "Cuba says it will continue receiving deportation flights from the U.S. based on a previous accord between the two countries, even though the State Department says it has no plans to hold migration talks with the island\u2019s government.",
      "But the suspension of migration talks comes as President Donald Trump continues to crack down on immigrants and carry out what he calls the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history. It's not clear how the Trump administration plans larger scale repatriations of Cubans without legal immigration status.",
      "A State Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement to NBC News that \u201cthe Trump Administration will no longer engage the Cuban regime for the sole sake of engagement and endless dialogue.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have nothing to preview at this time,\u201d the statement said.",
      "When asked about the Trump administration\u2019s comments, the Cuban government told NBC News it will continue to abide by 2017 migration accords it negotiated with\u00a0then-President Barack Obama. At the time, the Cuban government agreed to accept deportations on a case-by-case basis.",
      "But the monthly flights usually have less than 100 people, far below the mass deportations Trump has vowed to carry out. Deportations on a larger scale would have to be negotiated between the two countries.",
      "\u201cBilateral migration talks are not part of the agreements, and they can be carried out even without talks. In fact, they have been a convenient vehicle to aid their implementation, and both governments have determined for most of the past few years that they are useful for mutually defined objectives,\u201d Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez de Cossio told NBC News in an emailed response to questions.",
      "\u201cIt is known that, despite the persistent unilateral hostility of the United States, Cuba is willing to meet to ensure the objectives that both countries have defined regarding migration,\" de Cossio said.",
      "Migration meetings between the two counties have taken place since the 1990s, though they were suspended under the George W. Bush administration and under the first Trump administration. The countries resumed migration talks in 2022 under the Biden administration amid a historic wave of Cuban migrants entering the U.S.",
      "Cubans were among the largest groups of migrants in recent years. U.S. Customs and Border Protection registered over 600,000 encounters with Cubans from fiscal years 2022 to 2024. That number has now dropped dramatically.",
      "As part of the 2017 accords, Obama agreed to end the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy that allowed Cubans who arrived on United States soil without visas to remain in the country legally and gain residency. The Obama administration also eliminated the Cuban Medical Parole program under which Cuban medical professionals on missions overseas could defect and get fast-tracked visas to the United States.",
      "The Trump administration ended a Biden-era parole program that gave temporary legal status to hundreds of thousands of applicants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, though it's been temporarily blocked by a judge.",
      "Trump terminated the Biden-era CBP One app that allowed migrants to remain in the U.S. for two years, and this month told them to leave the country immediately. Over 900,000 people were allowed in the country using the app from January 2023 until Trump closed it down on his first day in office. It\u2019s not clear how many were Cuban.",
      "Cuba has long said the U.S. incentivizes migration from the island by devastating its economy through heavy economic sanctions while making it easier for Cubans, in comparison to other groups, to gain residency and then citizenship.",
      "De Cossio stressed that Cuba is \u201ccommitted\u201d to complying with the 2017 agreements.",
      "But he added that \u201cthe strict implementation of the economic blockade remains in place,\" referring to the decades-old U.S. embargo against Cuba, \u201cwhich is recognized as an important factor in encouraging Cuban emigration, both regular and irregular, and explains the large presence of our nationals in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt applies a policy of economic warfare that depresses Cubans\u2019 standard of living and drives them to emigrate,\u201d de Cossio said.",
      "He said the U.S. has used migration \u201cfor destabilization purposes against Cuba.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is why we say it is neither fair nor realistic to propose a mass deportation of Cubans in the United States, who have been pushed by U.S. policy and also admitted and protected by U.S. policies. Most have made a life there, have jobs, properties, and family members, and it is not fair to deport them for a change of heart,\u201d de Cossio said.",
      "Official exchanges between the United States and Cuba under the Trump administration have been limited to contact between the two embassies as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Cuba and the State Department to discuss specific issues, according to de Cossio.",
      "He said Cuba had summoned the charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires in Cuba, Mike Hammer, \u201cto warn him about his conduct that is not what is expected of a diplomat.\u201d",
      "In the last months, Hammer has engaged with prominent political dissidents on the communist island, an issue that also came up during Trump\u2019s first presidency as well.",
      "\u201cOn the part of Cuba, there is a willingness to develop respectful and constructive relations with the United States, regardless of who is president, as long as the standards that should prevail in bilateral ties between sovereign countries are respected,\u201d said de Cossio. \u201cToday, that willingness does not appear to exist in Washington. The narrow and hostile priorities of anti-Cuban sectors incapable of accepting Cuba\u2019s right to full sovereignty and self-determination prevail.\u201d",
      "De Cossio said he didn't see a reason why it's impossible to move toward a \"civilized\" relationship between the two countries and end what he categorized as \"a long-standing, unjust, and highly asymmetrical conflict.\""

      "A Texas mother who officials say took alcoholic Jell-O shots to her child\u2019s elementary school Christmas party has been arrested.",
      "Teresa Isabel Bernal, 33, was charged with injury to a child in connection to a party Dec. 20 at  Jones Elementary School in Tyler Texas.",
      "Bernal purchased the Jell-O shots from a home business she found on Facebook, according to the arrest affidavit.",
      "The shots were laid out on a table along with treats students had brought to share in a cafeteria where fifth-grade classes gathered, officials said.",
      "Fifteen students consumed the shots, and nearly all reported \u201chaving stomach aches and headaches,\u201d the affidavit said.",
      "One student told police he vomited twice at school that day, and another student said he \u201cpassed out\u201d at school after consuming the Jell-O shot, according to the affidavit.",
      "One student reported that he had six Jell-O shots and got dizzy. When he returned to his classroom, he \u201cgot dizzy and fell and felt like he could not get back on his feet,\u201d the affidavit said.",
      "When questioned by a Tyler Independent School District police officer, Bernal said she did not know the shots contained alcohol, but conceded \u201cthey do taste different,\u201d the arrest affidavit said. She said she discovered the shots had alcohol only after the children had consumed some of them, according to officials.",
      "Bernal did not immediately respond to a message left on a phone number listed under her name.",
      "A teacher told police that two other teachers tried the shots and said they believed the shots contained alcohol. The teacher tried one herself but couldn't tell because of the flavor, police said.",
      "The teacher took the kids back to her class and sent those who consumed a Jell-O shot to the nurse's office. After that, just four children remained in her class, officials said.",
      "The party took place just before holiday break, and the investigating officer interviewed teachers when they returned to work Jan. 6.",
      "\u201cDuring the interviews I was told, while some of the teachers found it odd that Bernal would bring Jell-O shots to an elementary school party, they were trusting Bernal to not bring anything harmful to the school party. Bernal was an involved parent and was present at many functions at the school,\u201d the file said.",
      "The Facebook sweets business Bernal had purchased the shots from had a clear disclaimer on its website stating the shots were made with Smirnoff vodka, the affidavit said.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, there is no way Bernal could have missed the fact that the Jell-O shots she purchased \u2026 and brought to her daughter\u2019s 5th grade Christmas party contained drinking alcohol,\u201d the officer wrote in the affidavit.",
      "Testing of the shots also indicated the shots did contain ethanol.",
      "Bernal was arrested and booked into the Smith County Jail on Monday and posted $75,000 bond the same day.\u00a0It's not immediately clear if she's retained an attorney.",
      "The Tyler Independent School District said it was aware of Bernal's arrest.",
      "\"At the time, a parent volunteer brought homemade\u00a0Jello\u00a0to the celebration, which was later found to contain alcohol. Unfortunately, some students consumed the\u00a0Jello\u00a0before the situation was discovered.\u00a0Staff acted immediately to address the situation, informing parents and working with law enforcement,\" the district said.",
      "The district said Bernal has not been allowed back to campus.",

    "story": [
      "Pete Hegseth wants\u00a0Donald Trump to see him as a fighter amid the negative stories swirling around the defense secretary, two U.S. officials told NBC News, and has been focusing more on public and television appearances\u00a0\u2014 including on his old network, Fox News \u2014 in which\u00a0he can\u00a0speak directly\u00a0to\u00a0the president.",
      "Trump had told Hegseth during a recent phone call that he did not approve of his texting information about airstrikes in Yemen to a Signal group that included Hegseth\u2019s wife, his brother and his personal attorney, describing what the defense secretary had done as childish, one U.S. official and another person familiar with the conversation said. The call ended with Trump telling Hegseth to keep fighting, however.",
      "As he battles to keep his job amid a flood of reports about his behavior and infighting in his Pentagon, Hegseth\u2019s behavior has\u00a0become\u00a0\u201cerratic,\u201d\u00a0and he\u00a0seems increasingly\u00a0\u201cinsecure\u201d\u00a0about his job and standing in the administration, leading him to frequently reinforce to staff that he can\u2019t allow himself to be fired, according to  two officials familiar with the situation.",
      "Officials who operate in Hegseth\u2019s vicinity describe him as difficult and prickly, and said that he berates and yells at the staff. The officials described a tense environment with fighting, even yelling, among Hegseth\u2019s senior staff.",
      "Last month, Hegseth was furious about leaks of his having approved a military briefing for Elon Musk on China, according to multiple defense officials. When officials found out The New York Times was preparing to report the meeting, Hegseth screamed at\u00a0Adm. Chris Grady, the\u00a0acting chairman\u00a0of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, saying he\u00a0would \u201cf---ing\u00a0polygraph\u201d him to find out if he leaked the information about the meeting, according to three U.S. officials familiar with the meeting. Hegseth staffers also threatened to polygraph\u00a0Adm. Sam Paparo, the commander of U.S. IndoPacific Command, and Lt. Gen D.A. Sims, the director of the Joint Staff, the officials said, and told the Joint Chiefs who had access to information\u00a0about the Musk briefing and the agenda that they would be subject to polygraphs, the officials said.",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report that Hegseth yelled at Grady and threatened him with a polygraph.",
      "As he deals with questions about his job performance, his handling of sensitive information and how long he\u2019ll be able to hold on, Hegseth has had a significantly diminished staff around him.",
      "Last week,\u00a0three officials\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Hegseth; Darin Selnick, Hegseth\u2019s deputy chief of staff; and Colin Carroll, chief of staff to Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg \u2014 were all told they were implicated in a leak investigation, placed on administrative leave and escorted from the Pentagon. They were not given specifics about the allegations against them but all were terminated last Friday.",
      "They released a joint statement the next day\u00a0in which they said,\u00a0\u201cWe are incredibly disappointed by the manner in which our service at the Department of Defense ended. Unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door.\u201d They went on to call the experience \u201cunconscionable,\u201d but said they continue to support the Trump-Vance administration, without referencing any support for Hegseth.",
      "Days after being fired,\u00a0Selnick and Caldwell\u00a0were both exonerated. It\u2019s not clear if Carroll was, as well.",
      "In another sudden staff shake-up, Hegseth\u2019s chief of staff, Joe Kasper, also left his role last week. On Monday, a senior defense official provided this statement to NBC News: \u201cJoe\u00a0Kasper\u00a0will continue to serve President Trump as a Special Government Employee (SGE) handling special projects at the Department of Defense. Secretary Hegseth is thankful for his continued leadership and work to advance the America First agenda.\u201d",
      "During a Fox News interview Tuesday, Hegseth was asked whether Kasper has a new role. \u201cHe\u2019s staying with us, going to be in a slightly different role, but he\u2019s not going anywhere, certainly not fired. You make changes over time, and we\u2019re grateful for everything Joe\u2019s done.\u201d",
      "On Friday, the Pentagon announced that Hegseth had tapped four officials who'd already been working in the building to support him in what\u2019s known as the front office. That includes Justin Fulcher, Patrick Weaver and Ricky Buria as senior advisers. Sean Parnell, who has been serving as the assistant to the defense secretary for public affairs and chief Pentagon spokesman, is now also a senior adviser. No individual had been identified as Hegseth\u2019s chief of staff.",
      "\u201cRegular workforce adjustments are a feature of any highly efficient organization,\u201d the Pentagon\u2019s acting press secretary, Kingsley Wilson, said in a statement. \u201cSecretary Hegseth will continue to be proactive with personnel decisions and will work hard to ensure the Department of Defense has the right people in the right positions to execute President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, revelations about Hegseth\u2019s use of Signal and potential security risks he\u2019s creating with it have not stopped coming. The latest is that Hegseth had a special internet line installed in his Pentagon office in defiance of the Defense Department\u2019s normal security protocols so that he could use the Signal app on a personal computer there, according to two officials\u00a0familiar with the matter.",
      "The so-called \u201cdirty\u201d line, referred to that way because it\u2019s not secured, increases the likelihood of the office being hacked or surveilled by a foreign adversary or another entity because it doesn\u2019t have the same security filters as other, highly secure lines in and out of the office. Hegseth\u2019s office is considered a SCIF, or sensitive, compartmentalized information facility, which is specially designed to protect communications.\u00a0\u00a0The existence of the line was first reported by The Associated Press on Thursday."

    "story": [
      "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell believes owners will come to a consensus in May on whether rule changes will be needed to eliminate the tush push play that\u2019s helped the Philadelphia Eagles win one Super Bowl and reach another.",
      "A proposal by the Green Bay Packers to eliminate the play was tabled at the league meetings this month but will be brought back up for a vote when the owners meet again in May.",
      "Some proponents of eliminating the play point to player safety even though there\u2019s no evidence of an increased injury risk, as well as the fact that the NFL prohibited pushing a ball carrier until a rule change that was put in place in 2005.",
      "The original proposal by the Packers would have only banned pushing a player who was lined up directly behind the snapper and receives the snap, immediately at the snap. There also has been discussion about banning pushing a ball carrier at any spot on the field.",
      "\u201cA lot of coaches would tell you that\u2019s not part of football, right. It may be rugby but it\u2019s not us,\u201d Goodell said Friday on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d at the NFL draft in Green Bay, Wisconsin.",
      "\u201cThe second thing is really the safety of the game. And that\u2019s of primary importance to us. Is it a play that\u2019s unsafe when you\u2019re in those positions where you\u2019re getting pushed or pulled and you can\u2019t control where you\u2019re going. Those are the two factors. On the other side, there\u2019s a legitimate argument that everyone can do it, and you know, if somebody does it better than the others, that\u2019s the way the game is played.\u201d",
      "It takes 24 of 32 votes to approve rule changes and neither side of the argument had clear support at the league meetings earlier this month.",
      "\u201cThere were different concepts that were discussed. I would say there was a split,\u201d Goodell said on McAfee\u2019s show. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an overwhelming push either way, but I think as people see the different things the committee has been considering and hear the conversation, I think that they\u2019ll actually develop a consensus.\u201d",
      "Goodell touched on several other topics in the interview:",
      "Playoff seeding",
      "Goodell touched on another potential rule change that was tabled until May, saying he believes there could be a modification to the proposal from Detroit to seed the playoffs by record instead of guaranteeing the division winners a top-four seed and at least one home game. The Lions made the proposal after Minnesota was forced to go on the road as a wild-card despite winning four more games than the Rams last season.",
      "Goodell said he believes the owners could approve a smaller move to deny division winners a home game if they finish with a losing record.",
      "\u201cThe question is at some point, if you\u2019re not .500 or better, do you deserve the ability to have a home game, too?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty hard to argue.\u201d",
      "There have been four division winners in a non-strike shortened season who hosted a playoff game despite having a losing record, with Tampa Bay the last to do it in 2022.",
      "18th game",
      "Goodell remains committed to adding an 18th regular-season game to the schedule in the future. The NFL went from 16 games to 17 in 2021, reducing the preseason to three games, and would like to get to a model of 18 regular-season and two preseason games.",
      "Goodell said he believes changes in equipment, practice rules and the offseason program have improved safety enough to add another week of games and the revenue that comes with it. But the league needs approval from the NFLPA to do it.",
      "\u201cThey have a right to approve it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s going to be really important for us, in having that conversation, say yes, we can grow the pie and they get a percentage of it. Is it the right step? I think we feel strongly that it is, but that may be something that will have to happen over a longer term. It may not be a shorter-term thing.\u201d",
      "International play",
      "The NFL will be playing games in Ireland and Spain for the first time this season and are set for the first game in Australia in 2026, expanding the number of countries to host a regular-season game to eight outside the United States. Goodell said the long-term plan is to get to 16 international games a year, up from seven scheduled for this season.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ll get to Asia pretty soon,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we can be worldwide with our game.\u201d",
      "Holiday play",
      "Goodell said he was pleased with the league\u2019s two Christmas games on Netflix last season and said the NFL will be a staple on the holiday going forward. There will be three games on Christmas this year, when it falls on a Thursday, and he said the league plans to play at least three Christmas games every year going forward.",
      "He also said there will be a small tweak to the Thanksgiving schedule with the Detroit Lions\u2019 annual home game moving from 12:30 p.m. ET to 1 p.m. ET."

      "During Antarctica\u2019s warm season, the sleek Norwegian passenger ship known as the MS Fridtjof Nansen departs regularly from Argentina for its journey south across the turbulent Drake Passage, down to the Antarctic Peninsula. The cruise carries wealthy adventurers, bucket listers and, increasingly, polar scientists looking to gather data as public funding for Antarctic research vanishes under the Trump administration.",
      "The National Science Foundation is one of the largest funders of scientific research in the world, with an annual budget of roughly $9 billion that supports the bulk of U.S. Antarctic research. Over the last few months, the Trump administration has ordered deep cuts to the agency, leaving scientists to wonder how they\u2019ll study everything from melting glaciers and ice sheets to the impact of pollution from power plants and wildfires.",
      "On Thursday, Sethuraman Panchanathan, the director of the National Science Foundation, resigned after the White House directed him to slash the agency\u2019s budget and staff by more than half, according to exclusive reporting from Science.",
      "Panchanathan\u2019s resignation follows an earlier order from Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to freeze funds for all new research grants at the National Science Foundation, and last week\u2019s announcement that DOGE will be terminating over $200 million in \u201cwasteful\u201d research grants awarded by the agency.",
      "Some experts are concerned that the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing cuts to the National Science Foundation may signal the end for American research in Antarctica.",
      "James Barnes, the co-founder of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, an international alliance for environmental nongovernmental organizations focusing on Antarctic conservation and research, says that the National Science Foundation has become an \u201cevil word\u201d among many in the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tragic to me having the National Science Foundation\u2019s budget cut,\u201d he said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cFor what reason? It\u2019s not good for us on lots of levels, because there\u2019s lots to be learned in Antarctica.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s directives specifically targeting Antarctic research include high-profile firings of several National Science Foundation staffers working on Antarctic projects and cuts to essential construction funding for McMurdo Station, the biggest U.S. research base on the continent.",
      "Research operations based in Antarctica had already been dwindling for several years \u2014 decades of robust field work were disrupted and never recovered from Covid-19 restrictions. Now, research on the world\u2019s southernmost continent is facing several years under Trump\u2019s slash-and-burn policies.",
      "But aboard the MS Fridtjof Nansen and its sister ship, the MS Roald Amundsen, polar scientists have reliable funding for their research. HX Expeditions, which operates the two Antarctic ships, hosts researchers from institutions like Western Washington University; the University of California, Santa Cruz; and the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Their room and board is covered by ticket purchases from tourists sailing to Antarctica for their once-in-a-lifetime trips.",
      "\u201cWe would not be able to support the research that we are supporting if we did not have paying customers that would allow our ships to go down south,\u201d Verena Meraldi, chief scientist of HX Expeditions, said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not easy [to get there]. There are not many flights going down here and there are fewer and fewer research vessels.\u201d",
      "The tourists traveling with HX Expeditions are part of the exploding ecotourism industry, which centers on experiencing nature while supporting local conservation. The number of visitors to Antarctica has increased from around 8,000 every year in the 1990s to more than 120,000 annually, according to the latest data from the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators. By 2035, the ecotourism market is projected to grow to over $550 billion.",
      "On its late March expedition to the Antarctic Peninsula, the MS Fridtjof Nansen was home to more than 400 ecotourists and several researchers, including Freya Alldred, a doctoral student from Durham University in England who says that without this cruise, it\u2019s unlikely she would have been able to get to Antarctica.",
      "Alldred traveled with sterilized bags to collect samples of seaweed growing in Antarctic waters and snow algae, which blooms on the continent\u2019s vast expanse of snow. She is studying how climate change affects the carbon content of these Antarctic species, and the cruise offered a unique opportunity to collect new samples.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve not been to anywhere with a research base,\u201d Alldred said. \u201cIf instead, I\u2019d gone to the British Antarctic base, I could only sample within my area. Whereas here, we\u2019ve been to five different sites across the peninsula that have potentially not been studied before.\u201d",
      "The boat housed scientists and ecotourists in close quarters, giving scientists the rare opportunity to explain their work directly to nonscientists through interactive sessions in the onboard lab. For 10 days, eager passengers attended lectures from resident researchers, ate with them in the ship\u2019s restaurants and shared their first steps on the vast polar desert that is Antarctica.",
      "\u201cTo share these experiences with people and then explain why we do the research, what types of questions we\u2019re answering with it, and for them to see it firsthand is incredible,\u201d said Chloe Lew, a researcher working with California Ocean Alliance to capture the impact of tourist boats on humpback whales in the Antarctic. \u201cIt kind of fires me up at my passion for the work.\u201d"

      "Harvard last week received almost 4,000 gifts online totaling more than $1.1 million in the wake of its battle with the Trump administration, according to\u00a0reporting from The Harvard Crimson.\u00a0The gifts came after the White House froze more than $2 billion in federal funding when Harvard rebuffed its demands, which included an audit of the school\u2019s student body for \u201cviewpoint diversity.\u201d",
      "Along with cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development and other federal funding sources for nonprofits, reports suggest the Trump administration is also considering broader scrutiny of the nonprofit sector, potentially targeting organizations with causes or positions that contradict the administration or are viewed as overly partisan.",
      "In response, nonprofits have launched their most aggressive fundraising efforts since the Covid pandemic, arguing that the very future of the nonprofit sector and free speech is under attack. So far, however, major donors haven\u2019t responded with large public gifts the way they did in 2020 and 2021.",
      "Harvard President Alan Garber and other leaders have been reaching out to the school\u2019s roster of mega-donors \u2014 including Michael Bloomberg, Ken Griffin and others \u2014 but none have so far announced major gifts. Advisors to some large donors say their clients don\u2019t agree with Harvard\u2019s positions or the school\u2019s progress on antisemitism and other issues. Other clients don\u2019t want to be seen publicly opposing the administration.",
      "Philanthropy experts and advisors say some of today\u2019s wealthy donors and foundations don\u2019t want to be seen as taking sides for fear of public criticism. Some are giving \u2014 but doing so quietly and privately.",
      "Other donors agree with Trump administration criticisms that many nonprofits or institutions have become too ideologically one-sided and political and should be seeking to reform or compromise.",
      "The\u00a0recent trend\u00a0of nonprofits relying on larger gifts from a smaller pool of ultra-wealthy donors has made the problem worse, since they can no longer rely on large numbers of small donations from grassroots fundraising. A report from Altrata found that ultra-high-net-worth individuals \u2014 those worth $30 million or more \u2014 now account for 38% of all charitable giving worldwide. The world\u2019s 3,200 billionaires account for 8% of all individual philanthropy.",
      "For most of today\u2019s big donors, the nonprofit turmoil erupted so quickly that they\u2019re still processing and assessing the best response. Nicholas Tedesco, CEO of the National Center for Family Philanthropy, said members are asking how to navigate the political climate and how to best protect their grantees.",
      "\u201cThe questions they\u2019re asking first and foremost are, what is the risk to philanthropic individuals and families to move resources, and how can we protect our grantee partners, and how do we, the philanthropic individuals and families, navigate an environment of risk that allows us to have fidelity to our mission and be responsive to the needs of our constituents?\u201d Tedesco said.",
      "BJ Goergen Maloney, head of private advisory at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, said clients have gotten the message that nonprofits feel in crisis.",
      "\u201cDonors are feeling funding urgency, similar to the early Covid-19 crisis for nonprofits, especially those reliant on federal funding,\u201d she said. She added that many nonprofits are merging or closing for economies of scale, especially overseas.",
      "Ed Chaney, a lawyer who advises tax-exempt organizations, said some of his private foundation clients have even stopped giving to causes singled out by the Trump organization.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m seeing some folks kind of sanitize things a bit. I see some folks who are ready to brawl,\u201d he said. \u201cIt ultimately comes down to the individual circumstances of the philanthropic entity.\u201d",
      "Chaney noted that wealthy donors tend to move slower than small-dollar donors as they rarely make major donations for general operating support.",
      "\u201cThey have to negotiate a gift agreement and all that sort of stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that bigger donors responded but they started a conversation that\u2019s not going to end for a while.\u201d",
      "Some philanthropists are trying to show resolve, even if they haven\u2019t committed to a specific dollar gift this year. In late March, the Trust-Based Philanthropy Project launched its\u00a0\u201cMeet the Moment\u201d\u00a0pledge. So far, 118 signatories representing $23.7 billion in assets have committed to support nonprofits in their time of need, namely through unrestricted and multiyear funding.",
      "Another\u00a0public statement, which says charitable giving is a First Amendment right, has been signed by more than 500 foundations as of Thursday morning.",
      "The Kenneth Rainin Foundation has signed both pledges and said it will distribute an extra $4 million this year. Shelley Trott, the family foundation\u2019s executive director, said many funders are stepping up their support but doing it quietly to avoid government scrutiny.",
      "\u201cThe work has unfortunately been politicized,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all trying to find our footing because this is unprecedented.\u201d",
      "She added that the threat to Harvard\u2019s tax exemption and broader attacks on academia have \u201cgalvanized\u201d some philanthropists and emboldened them to speak out.",
      "\u201cWe must stand together to protect the freedom to direct private resources to the issues people care about,\u201d Trott said, \u201cregardless of politics or who is in power.\u201d",
      "Jordana Barrack, executive director of Mighty Arrow Family Foundation, said many funders are moving slowly, as they aren\u2019t sure how to prioritize their giving in the face of dire need.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough resources to save everyone and keep all these organizations open,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do we decide what does get Band-Aids and what doesn\u2019t? That\u2019s the tough part that a lot of funders are overwhelmed by, and it\u2019s slowing down their decision-making process.\u201d",
      "Mighty Arrow, created by New Belgium Brewing co-founder Kim Jordan, has a mandate to spend down its assets by 2040. But family foundations designed to exist in perpetuity have to consider how increased spending during a depressed market will deplete their endowments.",
      "Priscilla Kersten, president of Square One Foundation, said her top priority isn\u2019t the longevity of the foundation, which her parents started in 1957 with their manufacturing fortune. Square One recently launched a rapid response fund and hosted a six-hour conference for grantees so they could coordinate resources.",
      "\u201cThe market is just the market, and it will come back,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t meet the moment during our lifetimes, I honestly don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve established this foundation and grown it for.\u201d",

Online scammers are increasingly turned to \u201cwrong number\u201d message tactics, aided by AI, to trick phone users into providing access to personal information and financial accounts.",
      "Ann Nagel, who works at a college in suburban Chicago, received a text that was convincing enough to make her think she should respond.",
      "\u201cI had actually thought it was from one of my members from an organization I run in town. It had me going for a few seconds,\u201d\u00a0Nagel said.",
      "But she quickly realized it was a scam when the texter asked Nagel to send a Vanilla Visa gift card and scratch off the back numbers. Nagel quickly ended the text exchange.",
      "\u201cThey are a tricky bunch of thieves, no doubt,\u201d Nagel said.",
      "Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at McAfee, says there is usually much more going on than just an innocent wrong number. The texters have multiple objectives by sending seemingly harmless missives to your phone.\u00a0First, he says, the scammers \u2014 most often based overseas \u2014 are validating that the mobile number is active and the person is willing to engage and respond.",
      "\u201cThey are adding the number to their database so they can target it surgically for future scams,\u201d Grobman said. They can note in their files that this person could be a potential future victim even if the initial exchange doesn\u2019t bear fruit.\u00a0And if a person, phone company, or wireless carrier blocks a number, the scammers will move onto the next one, as has been happening during the\u00a0recent wave of toll fine scams.",
      "\u201cOnce the first objective is met, what they are trying to do is build some sort of relationships,\u201d Grobman said, and he added that these criminals are often working as part of well-funded, well-organized criminal enterprises.",
      "Scammers are willing to put in the work to reach their ultimate aim, which is parting you from your money, and Grobman says the highest yield scams are ones that involve forging a personal relationship that can be turned into a form of what is known as a \u201cpig butchering scam.",
      "\u201cIt is slow; you feed the victim and slowly gain trust and move it forward,\u201d Grobman said.",
      "In 2024,\u00a0consumers lost $470 million to scams\u00a0that started with text messages, according to the Federal Trade Commission, five times higher than what was reported in 2020.",
      "Life savings, retirement accounts are the ultimate target",
      "Long, draw-out, text scams \u2014 sometimes including a romantic element \u2014 are chasing someone\u2019s life savings or retirement account. \u201cBecause there is such a large payoff, it is worth the extra time required to grow it,\u201d Grobman said.",
      "McAfee\u2019s research shows that 1 in 4 Americans have received these wrong number texts, although email still leads the way in overall online scam attempts, at 47 percent, followed by 24 percent via text, and 24 by social media.",
      "AI is making these once time-consuming, laborious scams more efficient and easier to target people. AI can help criminals zero in on area codes for tailored texts, comb through social media profiles, and build out family networks.",
      "\u201cWrong number\u201d texts, in particular, are increasing because of the confluence of data dumps over the past few years combined with AI\u2019s availability.",
      "\u201cThis allows scammers to create highly believable scams, higher levels of engagement, and higher levels of victims falling for scams,\u201d Grobman said. \u201cConsumers need to be very careful.\u00a0You really shouldn\u2019t engage,\u201d he added.",
      "But that can be difficult for some because psychology is as much a part of the text scammer\u2019s toolkit as AI and software. \u201cTheir effectiveness taps into something much deeper: our human need for connection,\u201d said Malka Shaw, a New Jersey-based psychotherapist in private practice who has seen a rise in text scam victims in her practice.",
      "Shaw says the long shadow of Covid continues to casts its darkness over this problem. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a time where loneliness has reached epidemic levels. Especially in the wake of the pandemic, so many people feel disconnected and unseen,\u201d Shaw said.\u00a0People who have endured trauma in their past or are lonely can find themselves more drawn into connections that can come via text.",
      "\u201cTheir cognitive biases will be down, and they\u2019ll say, \u2018I need that contact.\u2019 That is how they get you in,\u201d Shaw said.",

      "'Mini-ransoms' for locked social media accounts",

Eder Ribeiro, director of global incident response at TransUnion, says emptying someone\u2019s life savings is the primary goal, but hackers can still derive secondary value from the texting.",
      "\u201cData is money,\u201d Ribeiro said, adding that even if they only get a name and phone number, such info can be sold on the dark web, or perhaps they\u2019ll get enough data to sell on the dark web and crack your email.\u00a0In some cases, a text scammer will be able to extract enough of a response to track down the person\u2019s social media accounts and lock them out and people are willing to pay to reclaim their accounts.",
      "\u201cWe see people pay smaller amounts of money to gain access to their social media,\u201d Riberio said, adding that those \u201cmini-ransoms\u201d can be between $200-$800, not the huge payday the hacker was seeking, but still something.",
      "\u201cThey can find out stuff about most people and use it for extortion, fraud, or the information can be aggregated for the data and sold,\u201d Ribiero said.",
      "Dustin Brewer, senior director of proactive cybersecurity services at BlueVoyant, says the best advice for recipients of unwanted texts is to ignore the messages. Do not initiate a response and mark them as spam. These simple steps empower people by making a firm decision while removing the text from their inbox.",
      "\u201cAnd doing so makes me an undesirable target for the scammer, and no follow-up messages occur for the most part,\u201d Brewer said. Marking it spam could help others by alerting your messaging app that this message is potential bait for a scammer. Some messaging apps use this type of reporting to detect future scams and protect other users, Brewer said.",
      "But TransUnion\u2019s Ribiero says, for now, expect the texts to continue. \u201cThe frequency is increasing because it works, and if you get results, you keep doing it,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried,\u201d Trump said in\u00a0a Time magazine interview\u00a0during which he was asked about financial market tumult after his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement.",
      "In the decree, Trump slapped 10% across-the-board duties against all U.S. imports and released a list of tariffs against dozens of other nations. The extra levies were based on trade deficits the U.S. had against the respective countries and raised fears about inflation,\u00a0a potential recession\u00a0and disruption of long-held trade agreements.",
      "Markets recoiled following the release. Treasury yields initially headed lower but quickly snapped higher. The 10-year yield rose half a percentage point in just a few days, one of its quickest moves ever, as investors also ditched stocks and the U.S. dollar.",
      "Ultimately, Trump\u00a0issued a 90-day stay\u00a0on the reciprocal tariffs to allow time for negotiation. But he said it wasn\u2019t because of the market tumult.",
      "\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t for that reason,\u201d Trump told Time in the interview from Tuesday that was published Friday. \u201cI\u2019m doing that until we come up with the numbers that I want to come up with. I\u2019ve met with a lot of countries. I\u2019ve talked on the telephone. I don\u2019t even want them to come in.\u201d",
      "Yields have since moved lower, with the 10-year most recently around 4.28%, about a quarter percentage point higher than its recent low. Trump had said when he made the decision to hold off that the bond market had gotten the \u201cyips.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe bond market was getting the yips, but I wasn\u2019t. Because I know what we have,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what we have, but I also know we won\u2019t have it for long if we allowed four more years of the gross incompetence. This thing was just running \u2014 it was running as a free spirit. This was \u2014 this was the most incompetent president in history.\u201d",
      "Though\u00a0negotiations over tariffs\u00a0are ongoing, Trump added that he would consider it a \u201ctotal victory\u201d even if the U.S. has levies as high as 50% still in place a year from now.",

      "At car dealerships across the country, consumers are rushing to buy new vehicles ahead of\u00a0tariff-related price hikes. Some shoppers have also replaced iPhones early.",
      "Yet when it comes to other items, retailers aren\u2019t seeing widespread stock-ups or huge waves of early purchases due to tariffs \u2014 or at least not yet. Instead,\u00a0U.S. shoppers seem hesitant to spend and inclined to delay purchases rather than speed them up, according to consumer surveys by market researchers and early reads from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Consumer spending, excluding autos, was lower overall across the country, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest\u00a0Beige Book report\u00a0on economic conditions released on Wednesday. Five of the Fed\u2019s districts saw slight growth in economic activity, four districts had slight to modest declines and three reported relatively unchanged trends since the central bank\u2019s previous release in early March.",
      "Most districts saw moderate to robust sales of vehicles and some nondurable items, which the report attributed to \u201ca rush to purchase ahead of tariff-related price increases.\u201d Yet both leisure and business travel were down, and the report noted that \u201cuncertainty around international trade policy was pervasive across [district] reports.\u201d",
      "Beyond some of the pricier purchases that stand to cost a lot more even under a 10% tariff on imports, early data suggests the duties have intensified consumers\u2019 desire to watch their wallets closely as they wait to see how Trump\u2019s trade policy unfolds. Companies from\u00a0Chipotle\u00a0to\u00a0PepsiCo\u00a0and\u00a0American Airlines\u00a0said this week that\u00a0they\u2019re seeing pockets of slower spending.",
      "U.S. shoppers have adopted \u201ca conservation mentality\u201d for their cash as they follow fast-changing headlines and see wild swings in the stock market \u2014 and their savings and retirement accounts, said Steve Zurek, vice president of thought leadership at NielsenIQ.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much uncertainty right now that shoppers just don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to hide here \u2014 all they can do is control the household economics they have.\u201d",
      "Some survey results have backed up a theory that shoppers are kicking the can rather than accelerating purchases: about 35% of U.S. consumers said they planned to put off a major purchase, such as a home, car, appliance or furniture because of tariffs, according to a NielsenIQ survey. That compares with just 7% who said they anticipated making a major purchase now to avoid the possibility of a higher price later. The market researcher conducted the survey in late March, days before Trump unveiled steep tariffs on dozens of countries, almost all of which\u00a0he later lowered\u00a0for 90 days.",
      "In another reflection of consumer caution, along with higher mortgage rates, home sales in March\u00a0fell to the slowest pace since 2009, according to the National Association of Realtors.",
      "Retailers, airlines, car manufacturers and more will be watching consumer behavior closely as they try to predict demand and buy inventory. Some of those companies have\u00a0accelerated their own orders\u00a0of longer-lasting and pricier durable goods, such as equipment, to beat tariff-related price hikes.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what we know so far about consumers\u2019 early response to tariffs.",
      "Early buying",
      "In tariff fear-buying, one category stands out: cars.",
      "The auto sector outperformed the rest of the retail market in March, as sales excluding motor vehicles and parts increased 0.5%, while sales in the auto sector jumped 5.3%, the\u00a0Commerce Department\u00a0reported last week.",
      "While Trump eased additional tariffs on many countries that export goods to the U.S., he has kept a 25% levy on all imported vehicles.",
      "Consumers are rushing to showrooms to try to save thousands of dollars on a new vehicle.",
      "Cox Automotive estimates the 25% tariff on non-U.S. assembled vehicles will increase the average cost of imported vehicles by $6,000, while the cost of vehicles assembled in the U.S. will rise by $3,600 due to upcoming 25% tariffs on automotive parts. Those are in addition to $300 to $500 hikes as a result of previously announced tariffs on steel and aluminum.",
      "Automotive executives and dealers reported significant gains in showroom traffic and sales once Trump confirmed the tariffs late last month and into April.",
      "\u201cConcerns about potential future vehicle prices due to tariffs led to a surge in March sales, and April began with similar robustness,\u201d said Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox Automotive.",
      "New vehicle sales were running 22% above the\u00a0seasonally adjusted pace of last year\u00a0and were up more than 8% through early April on a volume basis, according to Cox.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been busy. Everybody\u2019s buying now because they\u2019re afraid the prices are going up,\u201d said Craig DeSerf, executive manager of Gulf Coast Chevrolet Buick GMC in Texas. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of been a little bit of a buying frenzy, like almost a replay of Covid.\u201d",
      "Michael Bettenhausen, a dealer in Illinois and chair of the\u00a0Stellantis\u00a0dealer council, said there\u2019s \u201cno doubt\u201d there has been a big pull ahead in sales due to the tariffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s taken a little bit extra effort ... to get the consumer to understand that the tariffs haven\u2019t impacted us yet,\u201d he said. \u201cOur inventory on the ground is tariff-free. Obviously if you\u2019re in the market and you\u2019re looking to buy in the next 30 to 60 days, you\u2019ll probably want to be doing it sooner rather than later.\u201d",
      "Higher sales are good for the automotive industry, after many analysts expected them to be roughly flat heading into the year. But there\u2019s concern that sales could come to a grinding halt once automakers and dealers sell out of their tariff-free inventories.",
      "\u201cInventory levels have declined substantially over recent weeks, likely pushing vehicle prices higher, so the end of April may not be as strong,\u201d Chesbrough said. \u201cWith economic concerns rising and consumer confidence declining, the outlook for new auto sales from here is more troubling.\u201d",
      "Automotive vehicles topped the list of purchases that U.S. consumers reported that they made earlier than they otherwise would have because of tariffs, according to a survey by GlobalData of nearly 5,800 adults across the country in late March and early April.",
      "Nearly 12% said tariffs had sped up their car purchase, followed by close to 10% of people who reported buying furniture earlier than planned and nearly 9% who reported purchasing large electronics.",
      "Stockpiling",
      "Yet when it comes to a wider range of merchandise like paper towels, clothing and more, there hasn\u2019t been a meaningful rush to stock up.",
      "Walmart\u00a0Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told reporters earlier this month at an investor day in Dallas that the nation\u2019s largest retailer hasn\u2019t seen \u201cpandemic-like buying from our customers.\u201d",
      "He said the company saw consumers bulk ordering in some stores ahead of the port strike last fall, but hasn\u2019t seen that now. But he did tell investors that the big-box retailer\u2019s sales patterns have become less predictable week to week and even day to day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just more volatility than what we typically see in our business,\u201d he said, adding that bumpier consumer spending continued into April.",
      "He attributed that to a mix of factors, including\u00a0weaker consumer sentiment\u00a0in February, poor weather in March and delayed timing of tax refunds.",
      "Chris Nicholas, CEO of Walmart-owned Sam\u2019s Club, told CNBC in an interview earlier this month that the warehouse club has not seen \u201cany material change\u201d when it comes to early purchases of items like appliances and consumer electronics.",
      "A later Easter than a year ago has muddled sales results, too. Total spending rose to 3.8% for April through April 15 compared with about 2.7% in March, according to data from JPMorgan. A note from the bank attributed that to the \u201cEaster effect,\u201d since the holiday fell on March 31 a year ago.",
      "That made the sales jumps look bigger leading up to this year\u2019s Easter on\u00a0April 20, since consumers tend to shop more ahead of the holiday.",
      "Walmart\u2019s Rainey said at the investor day that the discounter anticipated April would be its strongest month of the quarter because of the timing of Easter.",
      "Even so, tariffs may have fueled some early purchases in April. Along with Easter\u2019s timing shift, JPMorgan\u2019s note credited \u201cpossible \u2018binge\u2019 purchases in anticipation of tariffs.\u201d",
      "Store visits increased year over year the first two full weeks in April at superstores, grocers and clothing retailers, according to Placer.ai, which tracks retail foot traffic. Yet store visits declined year over year at home improvement and furniture stores, the company found.",
      "Delaying purchases and seeking deals",
      "Whether consumers are shopping for everyday items like laundry detergent or booking an airline ticket, tariffs have made them reluctant to spend and more likely to hunt for deals, executives have said.",
      "Procter & Gamble CFO Andre Schulten on Thursday said on a call with reporters that tariffs have led to \u201ca more nervous consumer\u201d who pulled back on spending in the last two months of the quarter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not illogical to see the consumer adopt the \u2018wait and see\u2019 attitude, and we saw traffic down at retailers,\u201d Schulten said. \u201cWe saw consumers basically looking for value, migrating into online, bigger box retail, into club [retailers].\u201d",
      "Outside of retailers\u2019 aisles, more price-sensitive customers are pulling back on domestic airline bookings, industry executives said this\u00a0month. Carriers are turning to fare sales to fill seats on domestic flights and trimming their schedules to shed excess capacity, though some warn revenue could fall this quarter from last year.",
      "Airfare fell 5.3% in March after a 4% decline in February, according to the latest federal data.",

Executives say economic uncertainty is keeping some customers on the sidelines.",
      "Some industry executives noticed the weakening of business travel demand in recent months amid the trade war, volatile markets and mass government layoffs.\u00a0Delta Air Lines\u00a0CEO Ed Bastian said on April 9 that in addition to weaker domestic leisure bookings, corporate travel demand \u2014 which started the year up 10% from 2024 \u2014 had turned flat.",
      "At the same time,\u00a0high-end travel demand\u00a0from first class to premium economy, and outbound\u00a0international demand\u00a0have proven more resilient, airlines executives say.",
      "Delta reported earlier this month that its domestic unit revenue fell 3% in the first quarter from a year earlier, while trans-Atlantic unit sales rose 8%. International flights\u00a0make up\u00a0a smaller share of the carrier\u2019s overall ticket sales than\u00a0domestic trips,\u00a0however.",
      "American Airlines\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0joined\u00a0Alaska Airlines,\u00a0Southwest Airlines\u00a0and Delta in pulling its 2025\u00a0financial outlook. United Airlines took the unusual step of offering two forecasts, one\u00a0if\u00a0things are stable and one if the economy shrinks.\u00a0But\u00a0either way, it expects to make money this year.",
      "American\u2019s vice chair and chief strategy officer, Steve Johnson, said Thursday on an earnings call that the carrier has logged \u201csignificant weakness in the part of our business that\u2019s very sensitive to economic conditions ... for whom travel is really discretionary.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn those circumstances, you do see prices that are lower,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to continue to be the case until we understand ... which direction the economy is going.\u201d",
      "Alaska Airlines warned Wednesday that weaker demand will eat into second-quarter earnings.",

    "story": [
      "Many student loan borrowers recently got some\u00a0unwelcome news: The U.S. Department of Education\u00a0will restart the process of involuntary collections, including wage garnishments, as early as May 5.",
      "\u201cAmerican taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,\u201d\u00a0said U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon in a statement.",
      "For five years, collection activity on federal student loans has mostly been paused. The Biden administration took a less aggressive approach than the Trump administration, focusing on extending relief measures to struggling borrowers in the wake of the Covid pandemic and helping them to get current.",
      "\u201cPeople who default on loans typically truly cannot afford to pay them,\u201d said James Kvaal, who served as U.S. undersecretary of education for former President Joe Biden.",
      "Outstanding federal education debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, with more than\u00a042 million Americans holding the loans. There could be roughly 10 million borrowers in default within a few months, according to the\u00a0Trump administration.",
      "Here are answers to questions borrowers may have about the upcoming collection activity.",
      "What payments can be garnished?",
      "The U.S. government has extraordinary collection powers on federal debts and it can seize borrowers\u2019\u00a0federal\u00a0tax refunds,\u00a0wages, and\u00a0Social Security retirement\u00a0and disability benefits, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.",
      "The federal government can intercept other funds such as state income tax refunds and lottery winnings, Kantrowitz said.",
      "In some cases, federal student loan borrowers can also be sued by the U.S. Department of Justice, and face a levy on the funds in their bank accounts, he said.",
      "How much money can be taken?",
      "Social Security recipients can typically see up to 15% of their monthly benefit reduced to pay back their defaulted student debt, but beneficiaries need to be left with at least $750 a month, experts said.",
      "Carolina Rodriguez, director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York, said she was especially concerned about the consequences of resumed collections on retirees.",
      "\u201cLosing a portion of their Social Security benefits to repay student loans could mean not having enough for food, transportation to medical appointments, or other basic necessities,\u201d Rodriguez said.",
      "Meanwhile, your entire federal tax refund can be seized, including any refundable credits, Kantrowitz said. Fortunately, if you\u2019ve already received your 2024 federal income tax refund, \u201cthe government cannot claw it back,\u201d Kantrowitz said.",
      "As for your wages, the federal government can garnish up to 15% of your disposable pay without a court order, Kantrowitz said. Wages of federal workers may be easier to seize, he added.",
      "How can I avoid collection activity?",
      "Take steps to get out of default and to try to avoid the start of any garnishments, experts said.",
      "Borrowers\u00a0in default will receive an email over the next two weeks making them aware of the new policy, the Education Department said. You can contact the government\u2019s\u00a0Default Resolution Group\u00a0and pursue a number of different avenues to get current on your loans, including enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan or signing up for\u00a0loan rehabilitation.",
      "Some borrowers may also be eligible for\u00a0deferments\u00a0or a forbearance, which are different ways to pause your payments, Rodriguez said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re advising clients to request a retroactive forbearance to cover missed payments, and a temporary forbearance until they can get enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan,\u201d she said.",
      "If you do end up facing the garnishment of your Social Security benefits or wages, the government is required to provide you with notice before it starts its collection activity, Kantrowitz said. For your wages, a 30-day warning is required, while 65 days\u2019 notice must be given before the seizure of Social Security benefits, he said.",
      "You may have the option to have a hearing before an administrative law judge within 30 days of receiving a wage garnishment order, Kantrowitz said. Your wages may be protected if your employment has been spotty, or if you\u2019ve filed for bankruptcy, he said.",
      "\u201cBorrowers can also challenge the wage garnishment if it will result in financial hardship,\u201d Kantrowitz said.",
      "You can dispute the offsets to your Social Security benefits, too, he said, by contacting the Education Department. The notice you receive should provide information on whom to contact.",

      "Almost nine years after Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris, the suspects accused of stealing $9 million of jewelry will head to court Monday for the start of a high-profile trial that will feature testimony from the reality star.",
      "A total of 10 people, nicknamed the \u201cgrandpa robbers\u201d by French media because of their ages, face charges in connection with the\u00a0break-in at the reality star\u2019s luxury suite\u00a0at the H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s, an anonymous-looking building known as \u201cNo Address\u201d frequented by A-list celebrities. The suspects allegedly wore ski masks and clothes with police markings, tied Kardashian up in the bedroom of the luxury suite and robbed her. They are accused of armed robbery, kidnapping or other criminal charges.",
      "All eyes will be on Kardashian when she takes the stand May 13 in the trial which is expected to last a month.",
      "Michael Rhodes, Kardashian\u2019s attorney, said that his client has \u201ctremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system\u201d and that she \u201chas been treated with great respect by the French authorities.\u201d",
      "Kardashian wants the trial to proceed \u201cwith respect for all parties to the case,\u201d he said, and is \u201creserving her testimony for the court and jury.\u201dMonths after the robbery made headlines, Kardashian talked about the incident in an emotional conversation with her sisters, Khloe Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian, that aired in March 2017 during a season 13 episode of E!\u2019s \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy door was open like this, and then I saw two guys holding another guy down in police uniforms, but right outside of my bedroom, 5 feet away,\u201d an emotional Kardashian said in the scene, a clip of which has been viewed 3.8 million times on E!\u2019s YouTube channel. \u201cSo I slid off my bed and picked up my phone and I\u2019m like I don\u2019t know how to call 911 in a different country, so I call Pascal \u2026 and then the guy came and grabbed the phone from me, threw me on the bed, and I was like, \u2018this is it.\u2019\u201d",
      "She said she saw the two men holding down the concierge, who was handcuffed and had a key to her room. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard from talking to him afterward is, they said, you know, \u2018Where\u2019s the rapper\u2019s wife? Let us up to her room!\u2019 in French,\u201d she said, referring to her then-husband, the artist Ye, formerly Kanye West.",
      "Most of the defendants were arrested three months after the incident occurred as part of a huge police operation that involved piecing together security camera footage and DNA evidence.",
      "But the legal process has been beset by years of delays, with many of the aging defendants now suffering from illnesses such as cancer and heart problems. One of them has since died and another is too unwell to stand trial.",
      "The defendants include: Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, known as \u201cOld Omar,\u201d accused of being the plot\u2019s mastermind; his son and alleged getaway driver, Harminy, 37; Didier \u201cBlue Eyes\u201d Dubreucq, 69; and the brother of Kardashian\u2019s driver in Paris, Gary Madar, 35, accused of providing the alleged gang members with information about her whereabouts. One of the accused is a woman, 78-year-old Christiane Glotin, who is accused of being an accomplice in planning the heist.",
      "Under France\u2019s judicial system, defendants in criminal cases do not enter formal pleas. They can admit or deny their guilt, but the trial proceeds regardless. Most cases in France are decided by judges, but as the maximum sentence of this trial is more than 20 years, it will be heard by a jury. There are no television cameras in French courts, so the proceedings will be documented by journalists and sketch artists recounting what happens in the room.",
      "At least one defendant has admitted to his part in the robbery. Yunice Abbas, now 72, wrote the 2021 book \u201cI Kidnapped Kim Kardashian,\u201d in which he detailed his life story and provided an account of the robbery itself. In the text, he describes being recruited months beforehand for a team to rob an unnamed \u201cwife of an American rapper\u201d \u2014 whose identity he only learned after committing the crime against her.",
      "\u201cA robbery! In the heart of Paris. Just like in the old days. Excitement prickles down my spine,\u201d he wrote of the moment he was hired for the job. However, he said he did not know the target was Kardashian until after the stickup took place.",
      "He described how he and his fellow thieves traveled to her apartments by foot and bicycle \u2014 his own ride suffering a flat tire, he wrote. Their police uniforms meant gaining entry was \u201clike a breeze,\u201d allowed in by the concierge who they then \u201cgently restrained\u201d and used to find Kardashian\u2019s room. He said he stayed on the ground floor while his accomplices robbed Kardashian \u201cwithout violence \u2014 a crucial aspect of the contract.\u201d",
      "But Kardashian has shared a different recollection of the incident, telling comedian David Letterman in a 2021 interview that one of her assailants \u201cgrabbed\u201d her that night.",
      "\u201cI was wearing a robe, and I wasn\u2019t wearing anything under it,\u201d she said on an episode of Netflix\u2019s \u201cMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman.\u201d \u201cI was like, \u2018OK, this is the time I\u2019m going to get raped. Just deal, it\u2019s going to happen. Just prepare yourself.\u2019\u201d",
      "In the years since the robbery, Kardashian has remained in the public eye and has continued to bolster her brand. With 357 million Instagram followers, she is among the most-followed people online. Skims, the shapewear brand she launched in 2023, is valued at $4 billion, according to Forbes. Kardashian, who in 2019 said she was studying to obtain her law degree, has also been a vocal advocate for justice reform.",
      "She and West, who separated in 2021 and settled their divorce in 2022, share four children together.",
      "The star has returned to Paris since the robbery. However, she has said that the 2016 experience rattled her.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s crazy is, meeting with my attorneys and knowing the information that I know now, [the robbers] had been following me for two years,\u201d she told Ellen DeGeneres on \u201cThe Ellen Show\u201d in April 2017. \u201cThey had been hearing interviews that I did getting excited about this jewelry or this jewelry \u2026 and it\u2019s not to say that I\u2019ll never wear jewelry again or anything like that. I truly don\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever feel comfortable, I truly don\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever wear real jewelry again.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy whole life has changed in terms of how I travel,\u201d she added. \u201cI never thought I needed security staying outside my door, even though I had a lot of jewelry and if you think about it, yeah, I should have had a security guard outside my door 24/7 when I\u2019m traveling \u2014 and I didn\u2019t. Now I have several just for me to be able to sleep at night.\u201d"

      "The nonprofit organization, which represents people convicted of crimes who want to prove their innocence, said it has uncovered new scientific evidence and witness statements\u00a0that prove Peterson did not kill Laci and their unborn son, Conner.",
      "\"I have steadfastly maintained my innocence from the moment my wife went missing on December 24, 2002, throughout my trial, appeal, and post-conviction proceedings, and to this day. I had absolutely nothing to do with the disappearance and deaths of my wife and son,\" Peterson wrote in his declaration. \"I am not a violent person.\"",
      "The Stanislaus County District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment on Friday.",
      "Peterson, 52, is serving life in prison without the possibility of parole after he was convicted of killing Laci, who was eight months pregnant.",
      "Prosecutors said he dumped his wife's body in the Berkeley Marina in California on Christmas Eve 2002 and tried to cover up the crime by making it appear as if she were missing. The bodies of her and her unborn son washed ashore in San Francisco Bay four months after she vanished.",
      "Peterson was initially sentenced to death in 2005, but the California Supreme Court\u00a0overturned his sentence\u00a0in 2020. The following year, he was\u00a0resentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.",
      "In his declaration, Peterson said authorities \"targeted\" him from day one and immediately labeled him as a suspect. He accused police of either misrepresenting his statements or failing to record or document them.",
      "Peterson wrote that the \"already biased investigation\" was \"irretrievably derailed\" when news of his affair with Amber Frey surfaced.",
      "\"Despite the disgraceful and immature behavior I exhibited when I was unfaithful to my wife and despite the poor judgment I exercised when I compounded the error by not being forthcoming with the police about it, I loved my wife very much,\" he wrote.",
      "\"I have lived with the pain of my poor judgment and character flaws inflicted on others for the last 23 years, and I will continue to live with that shame for the rest of my life. All of that being said, I was in no way responsible for Laci\u2019s disappearance or her death or that of our son, Conner,\" he continued. \"I do not expect forgiveness for my poor judgment or my hurtful transgressions. But I will never stop doing everything I can to learn who took my family from me. And, in the process, I will hopefully be able to prove that I had no role whatsoever in their deaths.\"",
      "The Los Angeles Innocence Project, which took on Peterson's case in 2023, detailed what it says is evidence that proves Peterson is innocent, including evidence showing that a home across the street from the Petersons' was burglarized on the day Laci went missing and evidence showing a witness overheard a conversation among the burglars that Laci saw them and confronted them.",
      "According to the organization, a van was also set on fire hours after Laci was reported as missing. The van allegedly had a mattress in the back that had apparent bloodstains on it.",
      "\"The Los Angeles Innocence Project advocates for truth and justice, no matter who the defendant may be or how controversial the case,\" the organization's board president John Sonego said in a statement."

    "story": [
      "The importance of a dependable, young and inexpensive \u2014 because of cost-controlled rookie contracts \u2014 quarterback is so perpetual in the NFL that teams tend to \u201coverdraft\u201d the position, selecting them far higher than a player might rank on a team\u2019s list of prospects, said NBC Sports analyst Chris Simms, a former NFL quarterback.",
      "It explains why since 2018, an average of 3.8 quarterbacks have been selected annually in the NFL draft\u2019s first round, including six in 2024. Yet that wasn\u2019t the case in the first round of the 2025 draft  Thursday in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Quarterbacks mostly remained on the sideline, waiting their turn.",
      "After Miami\u2019s Cam Ward went No. 1, as expected, to Tennessee \u2014 the seventh time a quarterback went first overall in the past eight drafts \u2014 another quarterback wasn\u2019t selected until Mississippi\u2019s Jaxson Dart at No. 25, by the New York Giants, who traded up for the pick.",
      "It was only the second time since 2016 that two or fewer quarterbacks were taken in the opening round and reinforced what had been said about this draft class for months \u2014 that the quarterbacks available were talented but not without flaws that\u00a0could\u00a0give teams pause.",
      "Though NFL teams remain desperate for quality quarterbacks, they have resisted making a run on the position so far.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so important in the league that at times, teams can overdraft the position,\u201d Simms told NBC News last week. \u201cIt\u2019s like, wait, this guy\u2019s really, like, the 45th player in the draft, but because of the importance of the position and all that, all of a sudden we\u2019re talking about him at pick number 10 or 11, right? And therefore that can happen a little bit.

      "Luigi Mangione\u00a0on Friday pleaded not guilty\u00a0to federal stalking and murder charges in connection with the\u00a0Dec. 4 killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO\u00a0Brian Thompson.",
      "The 26-year-old appeared in Manhattan federal court, sporting noticeably shorter hair and wearing mustard-colored prison garb over a thermal white shirt. He was chatting with his attorneys before Judge Margaret Garnett asked him to stand and make his plea.",
      "Mangione responded with only one-word answers before entering his not guilty plea.",
      "If convicted, he could be sentenced to death. Attorneys for Mangione did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "During the hearing, defense attorney Karen Agnifilo alerted the judge that someone had inadvertently listened to a call between her and Mangione.",
      "\"We were just informed by state court prosecutors that they were eavesdropping on his attorney calls,\" Agnifilo said. \"They said it was inadvertent that they listened to a call between Mangione and me. I am the lead attorney.\"",
      "The judge grilled federal prosecutors about the allegation, and  the team stated that Agnifilo's comments were the first time they had heard about the calls.",
      "The judge added that she expects an update from federal prosecutors next month to ensure Mangione is given appropriate access to a secure line.",
      "The next hearing date in Mangione's federal case is scheduled for Dec. 5, at which a trial date will be determined. Defense attorneys have asked for Mangione's federal case to go to trial first due to it carrying the possibility of a death sentence.",
      "Last week, a federal grand jury indicted Mangione on four charges, including two counts of stalking, one count of murder through use of a firearm and a firearms offense for an allegation that he used a silencer.",
      "Mangione is accused of shooting Thompson from behind on a Manhattan sidewalk outside a hotel where the CEO was staying for an investors' conference. Two spent shell casings found at the scene had the words \"deny,\" \"depose\" and \"delay\" written on them. After a five-day manhunt, Mangione was arrested at a\u00a0McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania.",
      "Prosecutors filed a notice on Thursday seeking the death penalty for Mangione, weeks after Attorney General Pam Bondi directed them to do so. The prosecutors cited what they believe is the intentional nature of Thompson's killing, Mangione's alleged desire \"to provoke broad-based resistance\" to the healthcare industry, as well as \"future dangerousness\" that he presents to it.",
      "\"Mangione presents a future danger because he expressed intent to target an entire industry, and rally political and social opposition to that industry, by engaging in an act of lethal violence,\" the notice read. \"And he took steps to evade law enforcement, flee New York City immediately after the murder, and cross state lines while armed with a privately manufactured firearm and silencer.\"",
      "Mangione is also facing\u00a0state charges in New York and Pennsylvania, including first-degree murder in furtherance of terrorism, two counts of second-degree murder, weapons charges, and a count of using a forged instrument.",
      "He pleaded not guilty to the murder and terrorism charges in New York.",
      "The courtroom was packed for Friday\u2019s hearing, and former U.S. Army analyst and whistleblower Chelsea Manning was among those who attended.",
      "After the approximately 30-minute hearing concluded, Manning shared her thoughts on Mangione\u2019s cases, describing it as \u201cunprecedented\u201d that two cases are running simultaneously: the federal case and the state case.",
      "\u201cThey have a capital case that\u2019s being speed run ... that is, we don\u2019t do that, we don\u2019t do that here,\u201d Manning said outside court. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that in America. We don\u2019t do that in our justice system. We don\u2019t speed run justice.\u201d",

      "Lenore Dove loves to sing but has a penchant for trouble as her rebellious tendencies often get the better of her. At the start of the novel, to mark Haymitch's 16th birthday, she gifts him a gold flint striker, which becomes the token he brings into the Games.",
      "Before being cast, Peak, 22, appeared in several shows and movies. She's best known for playing Stella in \"Molly's Game\" and Judith in \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.\" She was also in the \"Gossip Girl\" reboot and \"Hocus Pocus 2.\"",

      "Maysilee Donner",
      "Mckenna Grace will play Maysilee Donner, who is also part of District 12.",
      "Haymitch initially dislikes Maysilee as the two come from different worlds. Haymitch, who lives in the Seam \u2014 the poorest part of District 12 \u2014 doesn't like Maysilee's display of wealth and privilege. On top of that, Maysilee is a bully, never skipping the opportunity to call someone out, especially when it comes to their fashion choices.",

      "The baby creature from \u201cThe Legend of Ochi\u201d has captured the internet\u2019s heart \u2014 just as its creators intended.",
      "Director Isaiah Saxon tells TODAY.com about how his ideas came to life for the ochi, the name of the wild beasts who live in the forests surrounding a remote village on the fictional island of Carpathia, where the family-friendly movie is set.",
      "\u201cThe goal with designing the ochi was to create a realistic-feeling undiscovered primate species, so that a kid watching the film could wonder, \u2018Have I just not seen the BBC nature special yet on this animal?\u2019 Like, this feels like a real animal,\u201d Saxon says.",
      "\"The Legend of Ochi,\" out April 25, stars Helena Zengel alongside Finn Wolfhard, best known from his role as Mike Wheeler on \u201cStranger Things.\u201d When Zengel\u2019s character Yuri discovers a baby ochi who has been left behind, she\u2019s determined to do whatever it takes to get the adorable creature back to its pack.",
      "The pair go on an adventure through woodlands, waters and even a grocery store, where the baby ochi quickly melts the hearts of the characters and viewers alike.",
      "Filmed in the Carpathian mountains of Romania, the film takes fantastical elements from its location \u2014 but the magic of the baby ochi is that it is a puppet, Wolfhard tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see the ochi actually in action until I was on set, and the puppeteers showed me. Basically, they said, \u2018Do you want to meet him?\u2019 And I just looked at the puppet, and it looked up at me and blinked and had head movements,\u201d Wolfhard said. \u201cIt was like a truly real creature.\u201d",
      "There are complicated mechanics behind bringing the ochi to life, Wolfhard says, but it all comes together to make the ochi appear like a real-life animal.",
      "\u201cThe ochi had a whole team of people, and all the puppeteers are actors because they are all trying to get a very specific performance out of the ochi,\u201d Wolfhard says. \u201cIt was six people piloting one creature, as opposed to just one actor, but they were such amazing performers. That\u2019s why I like working with practical effects \u2014 it\u2019s so fun because you have that human connection with it.\u201d",
      "Saxon says inspiration for the gremlins came in part from his longtime obsession with Chinese golden snub-nosed monkeys. He also took elements from lemurs, tarsiers and other primates for the look of the ochi, while borrowing from birdsong and the noises dolphins make for the language the animals use in the film.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t looking to movie creatures or mythical creatures. It was looking to nature,\u201d he says. \u201cI really wanted to pull from the wide variety of superpowers that you do find in nature, and real patterns in zoology, and put them into one fictional animal.\u201d",
      "The cuteness factor for the baby ochi was important from the start, Saxon says. After drafting up several drawings of what the ochi would look like for the film, Saxon says he reached out to John Nolan Studios in London to create animatronics for the creatures.",
      "\u201cThey made a prototype that was completely furless and had no facial movement, but immediately, the five puppeteers brought it to life, it was just completely convincing that this was a real being,\u201d Saxon recalls. \u201cIt was absolutely adorable from the break.\u201d",
      "Saxon says designing the baby ochi as a puppet adds characteristics that play into how lovable the creature becomes throughout the film.",
      "\u201cA lot of the little imperfections that you might see in a baby primate trying to move learn how to move their own body, those are the types of little things that come through in rod puppeteering,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it had that vulnerability from the beginning, from the puppetry.\u201d",
      "Once the crew was on set filming in Romania, \u201cthere was a tremendous amount of effort in just like, policing his cuteness,\u201d Saxon says of the baby ochi.",
      "He joked about a \u201clast-minute rhinoplasty\u201d to make the baby\u2019s nose cuter after realizing it wasn\u2019t quite right, and other situations on set to ensure the creature had the look he was going for.",
      "The film, which launched in theaters in New York City and Los Angeles on April 17, is headed to theaters nationwide on April 25. But the hype for the charm of the baby ochi is only just beginning, as viewers start to react to the gremlin on social media.",
      "\"I just watched THE LEGEND OF OCHI and I want everyone to know that I would die for this little guy,\" one user posted on X.",
      "\"I completely adored THE LEGEND OF OCHI. It pulls inspiration from Amblin movies like E.T., Jim Henson\u2019s classics, and even Ghibli, but still takes tons of *weird* swings that create its own identity full of wonder,\" another X user wrote. \"They literally don\u2019t make family adventures like this anymore.\"",
      "\"Just like 'E.T.' was for so many of my generation I hope there\u2019s a kid out there whose new favorite movie is THE LEGEND OF OCHI and it inspires them to become a filmmaker,\" another X user posted. \"Lovely movie.\"",
      "Another X user said: \"The Legend of Ochi is a wholesome fantasy adventure. It has really beautiful puppetry and practical effects that really make the Ochi come to life. You love every second baby Ochi is on screen. The world feels very beautiful and unique.\"",
      "Others, understandably, were just reacting to finding out how adorable the baby ochi is.",

      "\"Omg he\u2019s perfect,\" another replied on X to a photo of the baby ochi puppet wearing a baseball cap.",
      "A24, the film's distributor, also joined in on the fun, posting a photo of the baby ochi with its arms raised with the caption, \"When you find out The Legend of Ochi isn't nationwide until next Friday but you need that little guy right now.\"",
      "\"The Legend of Ochi\" premieres in theatres on April 25."

      "Marienne Bellamy was introduced as a local librarian in Madre Linda, the fictional California town in Season 3.",
      "An aspiring artist, Joe found her to be strict and austere. However, over time, the pair struck up a friendly banter, which eventually transformed into flirting.",
      "She has a daughter, Juliette (Dallas Skye), although Marienne's ex-husband, Ryan Goodwin (Scott Michael Foster), had full custody of her.",
      "Their marriage had difficulties. Ryan was abusive and both were struggling with addiction when they had Juliette. Despite Marienne getting clean, Ryan was able to lie and use Marienne's past to manipulate the justice system into getting full custody.",
      "Marienne speaks fluent French as she was born in Paris and bounced around from foster home to foster home before she turned 18. Her biggest driving force in life is her daughter.",
      "What happened between Marienne and Joe in Season 3?",
      "Joe, hating Madre Linda, was drawn to the library that Marienne worked at. He began volunteering there, repairing the library's rare books.",
      "Eventually, Marienne became Joe's newest fixation. At the time, Joe was married to Love (Victoria Pedretti). Yet as is his pattern, Joe still became fixated on new women in his life, needing to stalk them. Once Love killed Natalie (Michaela McManus), Joe's initial love interest, Marienne became his prime fixation.",
      "As the two continued working together (and Joe stalking her), they got closer and eventually kissed.",
      "Realizing that Love would kill Marienne for their kiss, Joe planned to resign from the library. Before he could, Marienne admitted that she had feelings for Joe but would never break up his family. The two kissed again. Not long after, Marienne ended things as their secret affair was hurting her custody battle.",
      "The judge ended up ruling against Marienne in her custody battle, which meant Ryan was in the clear to take Juliette and move to New Jersey. Joe told Marienne that he was ending his marriage for her and the two became more intimate.",
      "But there wasn't a future. Marienne planned to follow Juliette and Ryan to New Jersey for her daughter's sake. Joe then killed Ryan so Marienne wouldn't leave.",
      "Joe told Marienne that he was officially separating from Love (despite Love not knowing anything of the sort) and the two told each other they loved each other, forming plans to run away together.",
      "At dinner that night, Love paralyzed Joe and invited Marienne over through Joe's phone. Love said they weren't separating and that Joe lied to her. Then, Love revealed that Joe killed Ryan because he was obsessed with Marienne.",
      "Love prepared to kill Marienne, but Juliette interrupted, causing the impulsive Love to pause. When she realized she couldn't kill either of them, she instead advised Marienne to run far away from Joe.",
      "Marienne told Love that she should run too, but Love couldn't \u2014 instead dying at Joe's hands that same night. Joe then faked his own death, posing the scene as if Love committed a murder-suicide.",
      "What happened to Marienne in Season 4?",
      "In Season 4, Joe once again relocated, this time to London. He continued to miss Marienne, who took Love's advice and ran.",
      "The show flashed back to Joe following Marienne to an art fair in London. When she saw him there, she ran away from him. Joe chased her and cornered her. Marienne told Joe that she didn't love him anymore and realized that if he's alive, he must have killed Love and faked his death. She called him a murderer and Joe vowed to prove her wrong. He let her go, telling her \"goodbye,\" to prove that he would never hurt her.",
      "Most of the season passes without seeing Marienne \u2014 although she is always on the forefront of Joe's mind.",
      "Then comes Episode 8's twist: Joe had been dissociating all season. He had actually followed Marienne after the art fair, drugged her and kidnapped her so the pair could \"work on their relationship.\"",
      "In his disassociated state, Joe put Marienne inside his cage. While transferring her from a tied chair to the cage, she tried to escape, breaking her arm in the process. Joe gave her pain medicine, but as a former addict she refused to take it. Time went by as Marienne begged for her life for Juliette's sake, but a disassociated Joe was still unaware he'd even kidnapped her.",
      "Once Joe realized that he'd kidnapped Marienne, he tried to remember where the cage was. As he tried to remember, Nadia (Amy-Leigh Hickman) found Marienne locked in the cage and offered to call the police. But Marienne told her not to, as Joe would just get away with it like he always has.",
      "Nadia returned the next day to help, but Joe had finally found the cage. He apologized to Marienne, telling her he never wanted this to happen and promised to fix it. Once Joe left, Nadia proposed killing Joe. Marienne said that she would kill him. Nadia said she could get ketamine and a knife for Marienne. In the process of procuring the items, Nadia was stopped by police.",
      "Meanwhile, Marienne asked Joe to check her phone to see how Juliette is doing. There Joe texted Beatrice \u2014 Marienne's friend watching Juliette \u2014 and learned that Marienne was losing custody of Juliette as Juliette's grandmother believed Marienne had left Juliette and relapsed. The news crushed Marienne and she begged for Joe to kill her, although he couldn't.",
      "So, Marienne swallowed the entire bottle of pain medicine she'd been resisting \u2014 killing herself. She left a note asking Joe to \"please leave me where I'll be found\" so Juliette knows what happened.",
      "In the finale, Joe left Marienne's dead body on a park bench.",
      "But \"You\" has one final twist: Nadia had given Marienne a backup plan.",
      "Nadia added her number under Beatrice's contact in Marienne's phone, faking messages that made her seem like a concerned babysitter. Nadia texted as Beatrice that Juliette's grandmother was taking custody (although this was false). This gave Marienne a reason to kill herself. Nadia also switched out the painkillers for beta blockers, allowing Marienne to pretend to overdose on the painkillers when she really just took beta blockers that slowed her heart.",
      "Nadia then followed Joe as he left Marienne's body on a bench. After he left, she injected Marienne with something that woke her up, freeing her from being hunted by Joe across the world."

Joel couldn't let that stand so he broke her out of the facility and perpetuated a massacre in the process.",

      "\u201cWhile I care extraordinarily about the show, it\u2019s a TV show,\u201d Mazin said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to disrupt someone\u2019s grieving process for their own parent, especially (with) a show that\u2019s partly about the grieving process.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "One of Ukraine\u2019s most prominent politicians, Kyiv mayor and former boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, has conceded that his country may have to give up territory to Russia if it wants to achieve a peace deal \u2014 a major departure from the policies of his country's\u00a0president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "The comments came the same day as Donald Trump said in an interview released Friday that \u201cCrimea will stay with Russia,\u201d the latest example of the U.S. president pressuring Ukraine to concede land to Russian invaders.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy understands that,\u201d Trump said, referring to the strategic Crimean Peninsula, which Russian illegally annexed in 2014. \u201cEverybody understands that it\u2019s been with them for a long time.",
      "The Ukrainian government has repeatedly ruled out relinquishing land to Moscow. That's left a gulf between its position and that of Russia and the Trump administration, which is brokering the talks and whose envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday.",
      "The meeting came at around the same time as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying in a post on X that it was \u201cclear\u201d that at least one of Russia\u2019s sweeping strikes on Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday involved \u201ca ballistic missile from North Korea.\u201d",
      "If confirmed, that would suggest that Pyongyang is sending materiel  \u2014 as well as thousands of troops \u2014 to Russia\u2019s western front and signal broadening support for Moscow from one of the West's most bellicose and secretive foes.",
      "In his long post Friday, Zelenskyy, said that while Ukraine had agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s proposed ceasefire 45 days ago, \u201cRussia rejects all of this. That is why this cannot be resolved without pressure. Pressure on Russia is necessary.\u201d",
      "Serhiy Leshchenko, an adviser in Zelenskyy\u2019s office, told the BBC that the comments on ceding territory earlier Friday by Klitschko were \u201ccounterproductive.\u201d",
      "Klitschko told the BBC early in the day when discussing ceasefire options that \u201cone of the scenarios is to give up territory.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d he added, \u201cbut for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution, temporary.\u201d",
      "Trump, who has often been accused of being more lenient on Russia than Ukraine, insisted to journalists Thursday that \u201cyou don\u2019t know what pressure I\u2019m putting on Russia\u201d \u2014 without elaborating. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, meanwhile, said the Kremlin was \"ready to reach a deal\" but that some details needed to be \"fine-tuned.\"",
      "It's those details that have so far been irreconcilable between the parties.",
      "As a president who once promised he could achieve peace in 24 hours, Trump eagerly wants to land a deal, particularly as he marks his first 100 days in office next week.",
      "Russia is hesitant to give up what it sees as its battlefield and diplomatic advantage \u2014 including an amenable president in the White House \u2014 according to regional analysts. And Ukraine is reluctant to sign an agreement that it believes will bring both painful territorial concessions and vulnerability to future attacks by the Kremlin.",
      "Klitschko and Zelenskyy are political opponents who have clashed before. But the Kyiv mayor is now one of the most prominent Ukrainian politicians to suggest that these demands could soften.",
      "Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and his forces currently control around a fifth of its territory, including Crimea. Zelenskyy reiterated his stance Thursday, saying there was \"nothing to talk about\" when it came to relinquishing territory on a more permanent basis. \"It is our land, the land of the Ukrainian people,\" he said.",
      "That stance had already prompted an angry reaction this week from Trump, who on social media Wednesday accused Zelenskyy of making \"inflammatory statements\" by refusing to cede land for peace.",
      "As well as diplomatically, Ukraine is under pressure on the front lines and in the skies, where Russia continues its nightly bombardment of civilians."

      "The appointments were heralded by some as monumental steps forward in an ancient institution defined by patriarchal power, while others criticized them as falling short of systemic change.",
      "In February, Francis made the highest-ranking appointment of his papacy from his hospital bed, naming Sister Raffaella Petrini to a role akin to the governor of Vatican City.",
      "Other notable appointments include Sister Alessandra Smerilli, an economist, to a senior position in a department of the Roman Curia, the Vatican\u2019s governing body, that deals with development issues, and Sister Simona Brambilla became the first woman to lead a major Vatican department, overseeing the world\u2019s Catholic religious orders.",
      "He appointed Sister Nathalie Becquart as co-undersecretary of the Synod of Bishops, preparing summits for the pope\u2019s advisory body, and gave women the vote for the first time at synod summit meetings, expanding the body to include women as full members. By October 2024, there were nearly 60 women joining around 300 cardinals, bishops and priests in the synod.",
      "Paloma Garcia Ovejero, who was the first woman to serve as the deputy head of the Holy See\u2019s press office, said Francis\u2019 move to assign more of the Vatican governing power to women was just the beginning.",
      "\u201cOf course, having a woman in charge of the town hall should be normal, but it isn\u2019t. Of course, having women in top-level positions should be normal, but it isn\u2019t. So elevating women in the church is only just starting, but there\u2019s no turning back,\u201d Garcia Ovejero said.",
      "\u201cWe saw these amazing appointments,\u201d Elizabeth Lev, a Rome-based art historian, said. \u201cReally startling appointments.\u201d",
      "Lev said Francis\u2019 moves reflect shifts in the wider society. \u201cIn many ways, what Pope Francis has done is simply taken these women \u2014 these religious sisters or lay women who have worked behind the scenes carrying an incredible burden on their shoulders \u2014 and given them the title,\u201d Lev said.",
      "\u201cFinally gave them the spotlight they deserve,\u201d Lev said. \u201cAnd that is wonderful. And he chose women who are competent, women who are joyous.\u201d",
      "\u201cPope Francis\u2019 legacy on the place of women in the church ... is complex,\u201d Anna Rowlands, a professor at Durham University in the U.K. and occasional Vatican adviser, told Reuters.",
      "\u201cHe did more than any other pontiff to ensure that women are included in greater numbers and higher positions of authority,\u201d Rowlands said. \u201cYet, most of that change was precisely within existing parameters, flexing the system (only) a little.\u201d",
      "Still, there are many limits to women\u2019s role in the Catholic Church. Francis repeatedly reaffirmed that priestly ordination is \u201creserved for men\u201d \u2014 and when the 135 male cardinals gather to elect the next pope during next month\u2019s conclave, it will remain clear where the church\u2019s powers lie."

      "In the summary of an internal report on the killings and a briefing to foreign media Sunday, the IDF said it \u201cregrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians\u201d and announced that it had discharged the field commander leading the implicated unit and formally reprimanded a senior officer.",
      "The report and the IDF\u2019s rare acceptance of blame were the culmination of a weekslong scandal that had heaped further criticism on Israel\u2019s military just days after it broke a two-month ceasefire agreement with Hamas and restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The controversy around the killings worsened after United Nations personnel recovered the bodies from a shallow mass grave near the scene of the incident on March 23, and cellphone video found on one of the corpses revealed serious inconsistencies in the IDF\u2019s original version of events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a chain of professional mistakes but with no ethical gaps,\u201d Brig. Gen.\u00a0Ephraim Defrin, said the newly appointed IDF spokesperson, in a presentation to reporters Sunday evening. \u201cThere was never any intention to deceive the public.\u201d",
      "Some initial reports from Palestinian examiners claimed that some of the medics had been found with their arms bound. However, other Palestinian medics said there was no evidence that the medics had been restrained before they were shot execution-style, a claim the IDF also denied.",
      "The Palestine Red Crescent Society said in a statement after the bodies were found that the targeting of the medics \u201ccan only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law, which the occupation continues to violate before the eyes of the entire world.\u201d",
      "The aid workers included paramedics, civil defense staff members and a U.N. employee.",
      "Israel previously said its soldiers shot and killed people they considered to be \u201cterrorists\u201d who were \u201cadvancing suspiciously.\u201d The IDF also claimed that vehicles that were approaching its position lacked headlights or emergency signals. At the time, Israeli forces reported that they killed nine militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad.",
      "The military later walked that back after video from the Palestine Red Crescent challenged its version of events. NBC News reviewed video from the phone of a paramedic who was killed, showing an ambulance with its headlights and emergency lights flashing at the moment the soldiers opened fire. The vehicle was clearly marked with the insignia of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Flashing lights from two other vehicles are also visible in the video.",
      "The investigation revealed \u201cseveral professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident,\u201d the IDF said.",
      "But the public report and the presentation, which retired Maj. Gen. Yoav Har-Even, who led the presentation, said were conducted \u201coutside the chain of command,\u201d did not answer all of the questions surrounding the shootings.\u00a0It did not provide evidence to back up the Israeli military\u2019s contention that six of the 15 slain emergency workers were actually Hamas operatives, nor did it explain why the number of slain medics whom the IDF considered terrorists had changed.",
      "The report and the presentation also left it unclear why one of the surviving medics, Asaad al-Nassasra, was detained by the IDF and still remains in its custody.",
      "Alongside the report summary, Har-Even showed a video presentation that featured aerial surveillance of the early-morning shootings, including night-vision reconnaissance video.",
      "The probe found that troops were hampered by poor visibility and that they misidentified ambulances and rescue vehicles as threats during a mission targeting Hamas operatives, according to Sunday's report. Har-Even laid partial blame on the soldiers\u2019 night vision goggles for leading to what he called the \u201ctragic and undesirable result of a complex combat situation.\u201d The goggles\u2019 limited peripheral perspective, among other factors, made it difficult for the soldiers to recognize the trucks as civilian emergency vehicles despite their flashing emergency lights, he said.",
      "Another strike on a U.N. vehicle resulted from a breach of operational rules, the IDF\u2019s report says.",
      "The field commander in charge of the operation on the ground, whom the report did not name but whom IDF public relations officers identified as a major, was dismissed in part for \u201cproviding an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief.\u201d",
      "The commanding officer of the 14th Brigade\u00a0received a formal reprimand that will appear in his personnel file, the report summary said, both because of his \u201coverall responsibility\u201d for the shooting and his \u201cmanagement of the scene afterward.\u201d"

      "At 9 years old, Mahmoud has known more trauma than most will see in a lifetime. On Dec. 6, 2023, the fourth grader was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, a blast that severed one of his arms and left the other so badly damaged it had to be amputated. On Thursday, an image of Mahmoud, taken by Palestinian photographer Samar Abu Elouf for The New York Times, was named World Press Photo of the Year, a haunting portrait of the impact of the war on children.",

      "When Mahmoud smiles, his happiness seems infectious, but some days are harder than others. \u201cThere are bad moments for him,\u201d his mother, Nour Ajjour, 36, told NBC News by phone from Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to play or go outside.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe keep him busy and have fun with him,\u201d Ajjour said. She sent videos of him gleefully speeding down a hallway on an electric bike, steering with his feet on the handlebars, and using his feet to play with a lump of bright-green clay.",
      "For now, Ajjour said, there\u2019s not much Mahmoud can do on his own, and he\u2019s impatient for prostheses, asking when he can have them so he can drink water on his own or help his family.",
      "\u201cHe likes to help a lot, and I let him help me and carry things on his shoulder,\u201d Ajjour said.",
      "Doctors at Doha\u2019s Hamad Limb Hospital are currently fitting him for protheses, and in another video, he smiles brightly as he tries on a pair of prosthetic arms.",
      "In Gaza, such treatment isn\u2019t possible, and\u00a0Mahmoud is one of at least 1,000 children in the enclave to have lost at least one limb during the war, according to UNICEF, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Many of the children, like many adults, underwent surgery without anesthesia as the health care system buckled under Israel\u2019s siege.",
      "\u201cThe first few days were very difficult,\u201d Ajjour said. Both of his hands were gone, and without anesthetic, Mahmoud was in both physical and existential pain.",
      "\u201cHe would look at his hands and not see them,\u201d the boy\u2019s mother said. \u201cHe would scream and say, \u2018Where are my hands,\u2019 and the first thing he said was, \u2018How will I hug you, how will I pray?\u2019\u201d",
      "These days, Mahmoud is learning how to type on a computer, write and use a phone with his feet. Ajjour said he dreams of going to university and becoming a journalist so he can tell the stories of Gaza\u2019s children."

      "But with Francis' death Monday at 88, the Catholic Church is at a crossroads: After 12 years of his leadership, does it continue on a progressive path to invigorate new followers with a message of inclusivity, or return to traditional roots at a time when some have yearned for church doctrine bound by conservative customs and liturgy?",
      "Megan Mlinarcik, who was raised Catholic, said she hopes to \"keep the tradition that's happened for hundreds of years\" as a worshipper at a Latin Mass in the Pittsburgh area."

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 Marcus Wu\u2019s home racing simulator setup needs one more thing: a manual gearshift. A decade ago, one from a Western brand would have been a no-brainer for gamers like the 12-year-old Hongkonger.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing escalates, the fact that Wu opted for a gearshift from Chinese manufacturer Moza illustrates how far Chinese manufacturers have come in competing with their Western counterparts on affordability and quality.",
      "The deepening economic conflict between the U.S. and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, has the potential to wreak havoc on a complex web of globalized commerce. And Trump\u2019s attempts to claw back manufacturing to American shores could have unintended consequences, including giving Chinese technology manufacturers an edge at a time when American products are already becoming expensive.",
      "Wu and his father-cum-financier, Mingfai, have already made their choice, opting for a Chinese alternative over American brands such as the Oregon-based Thrustmaster. \u201cIf only the price was good but the quality wasn\u2019t, then I wouldn\u2019t have bought this,\u201d the elder Wu said. \u201cBut this is cheaper and works great.\u201dThe duo were browsing Hong Kong\u2019s Sham Shui Po computer market \u2014 a sprawling hub of small tech stores selling everything from computer parts to gaming equipment for casual gamers and enthusiasts alike.",
      "To residents and tourists from mainland China \u2014 a country with a gaming market of half a billion users \u2014 the market is a one-stop shop, featuring top American brands including Dell, Corsair and the Nasdaq-listed Swiss manufacturer Logitech.",
      "Those are just some of the companies competing for market share in a gaming industry that accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates will be worth $300 billion by 2027. According to China\u2019s Game Industry Report, China\u2019s gamers contributed $44 billion in sales revenues to the industry last year.",
      "To be sure, Western brands are still popular when it comes to big-ticket items like monitors, processors and storage devices, but sellers at the market told NBC News that Chinese brands have been knocking it out of the park when it comes to accessories, like mice, keyboards and simulator setups.",
      "\u201cSo many Chinese manufacturers popped up after the pandemic,\u201d said Dennis Leung, a sales assistant at a store that specializes in gaming peripherals. \u201cThey often provide an extremely cheap and bargain price compared to the whole market,\u201d he said.Standing in front of a table of 30 mice, Leung held up two with identical feel and weight. The Chinese option, which was cheaper and more powerful, had been outselling its Western counterpart, he said.",
      "The Trump administration last week issued a memorandum saying that electronics including computers, smartphones and some components will be temporarily exempt from levies imposed on Chinese imports.",
      "But Trump\u2019s indication that duties on semiconductors and other technology could be on their way means it\u2019s still unclear whether electronics could get more expensive in the U.S. and whether prices of American-made products could go up for the rest of the world, too.",
      "That uncertainty may already be causing nervousness at companies such as Dell \u2014 the $56 billion tech giant has a 20% share of the global gaming market \u2014 as well as the $12 billion market cap for Logitech and specialists such as Corsair, which is worth $630 million.",
      "The administration\u2019s market-roiling tariffs come at a time when the quality of Chinese products has already vastly improved. That\u2019s giving Hong Kong\u2019s vendors a chance to capitalize.When it comes to buying gaming accessories, shoppers don\u2019t really care where the end product is coming from, Kira Fong, manager of another store in the market, told NBC News. \u201cMost people just look for quality. They still want the best equipment,\u201d he said.",
      "Analysts expect Chinese-made tech products only to get better.",
      "\u201cPeople are choosing more Chinese-made products in each industry, not just personal computers, gaming, smartphones or electric vehicles,\u201d said Xiao Feng Zeng, who analyzes China\u2019s gaming and esports industry at Niko Partners, an Asian and European gaming intelligence firm.",
      "\u201cTheir quality is better and the price is cheaper,\u201d the Shanghai-based vice president said, adding that Trump\u2019s policies will hurt America\u2019s ability to compete for young gamers.",
      "The policies of the president, who refers to himself as \u201cTariff Man,\u201d are already feeding through into higher prices.",
      "Hyte, a gaming PC sister brand of the California-based iBuyPower, said this month on X that while it was standing by increased prices, those prices will not be sustainable long term.",
      "That was not a problem for Marcus Wu, and more importantly his dad, at checkout at the Sham Shui Po market.",
      "With his son excited to go home and play with his new gearshift, Mingfai Wu breathed a sigh of relief.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Chinese,\u201d the elder Wu said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s cheap and good!\u201d"

      "Cuba says it will continue receiving deportation flights from the U.S. based on a previous accord between the two countries, even though the State Department says it has no plans to hold migration talks with the island\u2019s government.",
      "But the suspension of migration talks comes as President Donald Trump continues to crack down on immigrants and carry out what he calls the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history. It's not clear how the Trump administration plans larger scale repatriations of Cubans without legal immigration status.",
      "A State Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement to NBC News that \u201cthe Trump Administration will no longer engage the Cuban regime for the sole sake of engagement and endless dialogue.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have nothing to preview at this time,\u201d the statement said.",
      "When asked about the Trump administration\u2019s comments, the Cuban government told NBC News it will continue to abide by 2017 migration accords it negotiated with\u00a0then-President Barack Obama. At the time, the Cuban government agreed to accept deportations on a case-by-case basis.",
      "But the monthly flights usually have less than 100 people, far below the mass deportations Trump has vowed to carry out. Deportations on a larger scale would have to be negotiated between the two countries.",
      "\u201cBilateral migration talks are not part of the agreements, and they can be carried out even without talks. In fact, they have been a convenient vehicle to aid their implementation, and both governments have determined for most of the past few years that they are useful for mutually defined objectives,\u201d Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez de Cossio told NBC News in an emailed response to questions.",
      "\u201cIt is known that, despite the persistent unilateral hostility of the United States, Cuba is willing to meet to ensure the objectives that both countries have defined regarding migration,\" de Cossio said.",
      "Migration meetings between the two counties have taken place since the 1990s, though they were suspended under the George W. Bush administration and under the first Trump administration. The countries resumed migration talks in 2022 under the Biden administration amid a historic wave of Cuban migrants entering the U.S.",
      "Cubans were among the largest groups of migrants in recent years. U.S. Customs and Border Protection registered over 600,000 encounters with Cubans from fiscal years 2022 to 2024. That number has now dropped dramatically.",
      "As part of the 2017 accords, Obama agreed to end the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy that allowed Cubans who arrived on United States soil without visas to remain in the country legally and gain residency. The Obama administration also eliminated the Cuban Medical Parole program under which Cuban medical professionals on missions overseas could defect and get fast-tracked visas to the United States.",
      "The Trump administration ended a Biden-era parole program that gave temporary legal status to hundreds of thousands of applicants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, though it's been temporarily blocked by a judge.",
      "Trump terminated the Biden-era CBP One app that allowed migrants to remain in the U.S. for two years, and this month told them to leave the country immediately. Over 900,000 people were allowed in the country using the app from January 2023 until Trump closed it down on his first day in office. It\u2019s not clear how many were Cuban.",
      "Cuba has long said the U.S. incentivizes migration from the island by devastating its economy through heavy economic sanctions while making it easier for Cubans, in comparison to other groups, to gain residency and then citizenship.",
      "De Cossio stressed that Cuba is \u201ccommitted\u201d to complying with the 2017 agreements.",
      "But he added that \u201cthe strict implementation of the economic blockade remains in place,\" referring to the decades-old U.S. embargo against Cuba, \u201cwhich is recognized as an important factor in encouraging Cuban emigration, both regular and irregular, and explains the large presence of our nationals in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt applies a policy of economic warfare that depresses Cubans\u2019 standard of living and drives them to emigrate,\u201d de Cossio said.",
      "He said the U.S. has used migration \u201cfor destabilization purposes against Cuba.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is why we say it is neither fair nor realistic to propose a mass deportation of Cubans in the United States, who have been pushed by U.S. policy and also admitted and protected by U.S. policies. Most have made a life there, have jobs, properties, and family members, and it is not fair to deport them for a change of heart,\u201d de Cossio said.",
      "Official exchanges between the United States and Cuba under the Trump administration have been limited to contact between the two embassies as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Cuba and the State Department to discuss specific issues, according to de Cossio.",
      "He said Cuba had summoned the charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires in Cuba, Mike Hammer, \u201cto warn him about his conduct that is not what is expected of a diplomat.\u201d",
      "In the last months, Hammer has engaged with prominent political dissidents on the communist island, an issue that also came up during Trump\u2019s first presidency as well.",
      "\u201cOn the part of Cuba, there is a willingness to develop respectful and constructive relations with the United States, regardless of who is president, as long as the standards that should prevail in bilateral ties between sovereign countries are respected,\u201d said de Cossio. \u201cToday, that willingness does not appear to exist in Washington. The narrow and hostile priorities of anti-Cuban sectors incapable of accepting Cuba\u2019s right to full sovereignty and self-determination prevail.\u201d",
      "De Cossio said he didn't see a reason why it's impossible to move toward a \"civilized\" relationship between the two countries and end what he categorized as \"a long-standing, unjust, and highly asymmetrical conflict.\""

      "Almost nine years after Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris, the suspects accused of stealing $9 million of jewelry will head to court Monday for the start of a high-profile trial that will feature testimony from the reality star.",
      "A total of 10 people, nicknamed the \u201cgrandpa robbers\u201d by French media because of their ages, face charges in connection with the\u00a0break-in at the reality star\u2019s luxury suite\u00a0at the H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s, an anonymous-looking building known as \u201cNo Address\u201d frequented by A-list celebrities. The suspects allegedly wore ski masks and clothes with police markings, tied Kardashian up in the bedroom of the luxury suite and robbed her. They are accused of armed robbery, kidnapping or other criminal charges.",
      "All eyes will be on Kardashian when she takes the stand May 13 in the trial which is expected to last a month.",
      "Michael Rhodes, Kardashian\u2019s attorney, said that his client has \u201ctremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system\u201d and that she \u201chas been treated with great respect by the French authorities.\u201d",
      "Kardashian wants the trial to proceed \u201cwith respect for all parties to the case,\u201d he said, and is \u201creserving her testimony for the court and jury.\u201dMonths after the robbery made headlines, Kardashian talked about the incident in an emotional conversation with her sisters, Khloe Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian, that aired in March 2017 during a season 13 episode of E!\u2019s \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy door was open like this, and then I saw two guys holding another guy down in police uniforms, but right outside of my bedroom, 5 feet away,\u201d an emotional Kardashian said in the scene, a clip of which has been viewed 3.8 million times on E!\u2019s YouTube channel. \u201cSo I slid off my bed and picked up my phone and I\u2019m like I don\u2019t know how to call 911 in a different country, so I call Pascal \u2026 and then the guy came and grabbed the phone from me, threw me on the bed, and I was like, \u2018this is it.\u2019\u201d",
      "She said she saw the two men holding down the concierge, who was handcuffed and had a key to her room. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard from talking to him afterward is, they said, you know, \u2018Where\u2019s the rapper\u2019s wife? Let us up to her room!\u2019 in French,\u201d she said, referring to her then-husband, the artist Ye, formerly Kanye West.",
      "Most of the defendants were arrested three months after the incident occurred as part of a huge police operation that involved piecing together security camera footage and DNA evidence.",
      "But the legal process has been beset by years of delays, with many of the aging defendants now suffering from illnesses such as cancer and heart problems. One of them has since died and another is too unwell to stand trial.",
      "The defendants include: Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, known as \u201cOld Omar,\u201d accused of being the plot\u2019s mastermind; his son and alleged getaway driver, Harminy, 37; Didier \u201cBlue Eyes\u201d Dubreucq, 69; and the brother of Kardashian\u2019s driver in Paris, Gary Madar, 35, accused of providing the alleged gang members with information about her whereabouts. One of the accused is a woman, 78-year-old Christiane Glotin, who is accused of being an accomplice in planning the heist.",
      "Under France\u2019s judicial system, defendants in criminal cases do not enter formal pleas. They can admit or deny their guilt, but the trial proceeds regardless. Most cases in France are decided by judges, but as the maximum sentence of this trial is more than 20 years, it will be heard by a jury. There are no television cameras in French courts, so the proceedings will be documented by journalists and sketch artists recounting what happens in the room.",
      "At least one defendant has admitted to his part in the robbery. Yunice Abbas, now 72, wrote the 2021 book \u201cI Kidnapped Kim Kardashian,\u201d in which he detailed his life story and provided an account of the robbery itself. In the text, he describes being recruited months beforehand for a team to rob an unnamed \u201cwife of an American rapper\u201d \u2014 whose identity he only learned after committing the crime against her.",
      "\u201cA robbery! In the heart of Paris. Just like in the old days. Excitement prickles down my spine,\u201d he wrote of the moment he was hired for the job. However, he said he did not know the target was Kardashian until after the stickup took place.",
      "He described how he and his fellow thieves traveled to her apartments by foot and bicycle \u2014 his own ride suffering a flat tire, he wrote. Their police uniforms meant gaining entry was \u201clike a breeze,\u201d allowed in by the concierge who they then \u201cgently restrained\u201d and used to find Kardashian\u2019s room. He said he stayed on the ground floor while his accomplices robbed Kardashian \u201cwithout violence \u2014 a crucial aspect of the contract.\u201d",
      "But Kardashian has shared a different recollection of the incident, telling comedian David Letterman in a 2021 interview that one of her assailants \u201cgrabbed\u201d her that night.",
      "\u201cI was wearing a robe, and I wasn\u2019t wearing anything under it,\u201d she said on an episode of Netflix\u2019s \u201cMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman.\u201d \u201cI was like, \u2018OK, this is the time I\u2019m going to get raped. Just deal, it\u2019s going to happen. Just prepare yourself.\u2019\u201d",
      "In the years since the robbery, Kardashian has remained in the public eye and has continued to bolster her brand. With 357 million Instagram followers, she is among the most-followed people online. Skims, the shapewear brand she launched in 2023, is valued at $4 billion, according to Forbes. Kardashian, who in 2019 said she was studying to obtain her law degree, has also been a vocal advocate for justice reform.",
      "She and West, who separated in 2021 and settled their divorce in 2022, share four children together.",
      "The star has returned to Paris since the robbery. However, she has said that the 2016 experience rattled her.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s crazy is, meeting with my attorneys and knowing the information that I know now, [the robbers] had been following me for two years,\u201d she told Ellen DeGeneres on \u201cThe Ellen Show\u201d in April 2017. \u201cThey had been hearing interviews that I did getting excited about this jewelry or this jewelry \u2026 and it\u2019s not to say that I\u2019ll never wear jewelry again or anything like that. I truly don\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever feel comfortable, I truly don\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever wear real jewelry again.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy whole life has changed in terms of how I travel,\u201d she added. \u201cI never thought I needed security staying outside my door, even though I had a lot of jewelry and if you think about it, yeah, I should have had a security guard outside my door 24/7 when I\u2019m traveling \u2014 and I didn\u2019t. Now I have several just for me to be able to sleep at night.\u201d"

      "Jokes and memes about the tariffs Trump has imposed on Beijing and other U.S. trading partners have been proliferating online in China, embraced by state media seeking to rally the public as well as ordinary internet users bemused by Trump\u2019s policy decisions.",
      "\u201cThe Lord of Eternal Tariffs,\u201d which can also be translated as \u201c10,000 Tariff Grandpa,\u201d appeared last week in a report by CCTV, China\u2019s state-run broadcaster, which said Americans were \u201crising up in arms\u201d against the tariffs amid fears they could harm the U.S. economy.",

Earlier this week, after Trump said the U.S. was \u201cgoing to be very nice\u201d to China and that final tariffs would \u201cnot be anywhere near\u201d 145%, one of the top trending hashtags on the Chinese social media platform Weibo was #TrumpWimpsOut.",
      "Chinese social media users have also satirized what they see as Trump\u2019s strongman aspirations. On RedNote, a Chinese platform similar to Instagram, AI-generated images show Trump dressed like a Chinese emperor.",
      "Others have made fun of the idea of the United States reverting to a nation focused mainly on manufacturing, with one AI-generated video depicting Trump, Elon Musk, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio working on a production line in blue jumpsuits.",
      "Content creators on platforms not accessible in China have also joined in the online mockery. A parody account on YouTube produced a video called \u201cThe Song of MAGA,\u201d in which Trump, Musk, Vance and Rubio march together in front of a banner that says \u201cServe the people,\u201d a political slogan often used by the Chinese government.",
      "\u201cThe Lord of Eternal Tariffs\u201d joins other Chinese nicknames for Trump that have been around since his first term, such as \u201cKing Know-It-All.\u201d One popular transliteration of Trump\u2019s name is \u201cTrump Builds the Nation\u201d \u2014  the nation being China, which some say could become more influential in the world as the Trump administration withdraws from it.",
      "Joking aside, there are indications that both China and the U.S. are looking for ways to minimize the impact of the tariffs on their economies and people. Last week, for example, the Trump administration said that smartphones and other consumer electronics, which are among the biggest Chinese exports to the U.S., would receive tariff exemptions.",
      "Asked Friday about reports that China was considering exempting some U.S. imports from the 125% tariff, Guo, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said he was \u201cnot aware\u201d of the situation.",
      "But Beijing is openly pushing a campaign to help companies whose exports could be blocked sell them to the domestic market instead.",
      "Six Chinese online retailers, including JD.com and PDD, now have designated sections to help exporters sell their goods to Chinese consumers, the Ministry of Commerce said Thursday.",
      "Walmart\u2019s China unit has rolled out a similar channel in response to Beijing\u2019s call for the \u201cintegrated development of domestic and foreign trade,\u201d it said Thursday.",
      "At Joy City mall in Beijing, there are new signs that say \u201cExports turned domestic\u201d and \u201cSupport Chinese-made products.\u201d The section sells a wide range of products, including clothes, shoes, suitcases, canned food and even fine porcelain.",
      "Experts say the campaign may not gain much traction given that the Chinese government has struggled for years to boost domestic consumption.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cnaive\u201d for Chinese exporters to make up for their losses by selling in other markets since there are many products that only Americans will buy, such as Christmas decorations, said Andy Xie, an independent economist in Shanghai.",
      "\u201cPeople need to accept the reality that a lot of businesses will eventually all shut down,\u201d he said."

      "A member of the K-pop boy band Just B publicly came out as gay during a concert this week in Los Angeles. It's a rare move in a high-pressure Korean music industry, in which artists tend to be fiercely guarded about their private lives.",
      "Just B-member Bain, 23, made the announcement while performing a solo at the band's L.A. show Tuesday, saying \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a part of the LGBTQ+ community \u2014 as a gay person.\u201d Videos shared on social media showed the crowd responding with loud cheers.",
      "\u201cTo anyone out there who\u2019s part of the LGBTQ+ community, or still figuring it out \u2014 this is for you. You are seen, you are loved, and you were born this way,\u201d he added, in a reference to the song by Lady Gaga whom he called \u201cmy queen.\u201d",
      "He then launched into a performance of the song while waving a rainbow pride flag.",
      "Publicly identifying as gay is rare among active K-pop stars, whose behavior is tightly controlled by music labels and policed by fans who expect them to have wholesome images. According to the Korean media outlet News1, Bain is the first male K-pop star to come out publicly.",
      "After Tuesday's performance, Bain\u2019s bandmate Siwoo left a message of support on a fan platform, South Korean media reported.",
      "\u201cI was watching from backstage and I cried too,\u201d he said. \u201cI cried even more because I knew how hard it was for him.\u201d",
      "Fans have also shown their support, with one of the most popular comments on Bain\u2019s Instagram post saying, \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, kiddo. Always love yourself because WE LOVE YOU!!!!\u201d",
      "Just B, a six-member group, has released five EPs and several singles since debuting in 2021.",
      "Before Bain, Jiae from the now-defunct girl group Wassup said in 2020 that she was bisexual, while Lara, an Indian-American member of the U.S.-based girl group Katseye, came out as queer last month on a fan platform.",
      "Homosexuality is a sensitive subject in socially conservative South Korea, where same-sex marriage is not legally recognized. Discrimination against LGBTQ people \u201cremains pervasive,\u201d Human Rights Watch said in a 2023 report."

      "Trump\u2019s attacks on Canada\u2019s economy and threats to make it the 51st state have infuriated Canadians, who are canceling trips to the U.S. in big numbers. They also seem to have also flipped the narrative heading into Canada\u2019s parliamentary elections on Monday, with Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s Liberal Party surging after trailing far behind in the polls just a few months ago.",

      "The U.S. gets more visitors from Canada each year than from any other country, according to the U.S. Travel Association, an industry trade group, which said the 20.4 million visits from Canada last year generated $20.5 billion in spending.",
      "But there has been a big drop in foreigners traveling to the U.S. since Trump took office, and Canadians are no exception. There were more than 910,000 fewer land border crossings from Canada into the U.S. last month than in March of 2024 \u2014 a more than 22% drop \u2014 according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. An Air Canada spokesman, meanwhile, said Canada-U.S. flight bookings for April through September are down about 10%.",
