    "story": [
      "The discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at an Indian residential school in Canada in 2021 was just the catalyst for \u201cSugarcane.\"",
      "The discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at an Indian residential school in Canada in 2021 was just the catalyst for \u201cSugarcane.\u201d",
      "Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie, the filmmakers behind the Oscar-nominated documentary, spent years investigating the truth behind just one of the institutions. \u201cSugarcane,\u201d now streaming on Hulu, paints a horrifying picture of the systemic abuses inflicted by the state-funded school and exposes for the first time a pattern of infanticide and babies born to Indigenous girls and fathered by priests.",
      "In the year since it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, \u201cSugarcane\u201d has screened at the White House, for Canadian Parliament and for over a dozen indigenous communities in North America, sparking a grassroots movement and reckoning to find the truth about the other schools. It also marks the first time that an Indigenous North American filmmaker has received an Oscar nomination.",
      "From the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died. Nearly three-quarters of the 130 residential schools were run by Roman Catholic missionary congregations",
      "Canada\u2019s residential schools were based on similar facilities in the United States, where Catholic and Protestant denominations operated more than 150 boarding schools between the 19th and 20th centuries, according to researchers, that also were home to rampant abuse.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too often that we look everywhere else in the world to horrors and abuses happening, and that\u2019s important, but Native issues are rarely the issue of the day, and we believe that they deserve to be,\u201d Kassie said. \u201cThis story is the genocide that happened across North America, and we\u2019ve never grappled with it. Native people have rarely been the focal point of that kind of countrywide dialogue. We hope that \u2019Sugarcane\u201d helps to change that.\u201d",
      "As an investigative journalist and documentarian, Kassie had spent a decade making films about human rights abuses all over the world, from Afghanistan to Niger, but she\u2019d never turned her lens to her own country. When the news broke about the unmarked graves, she felt drawn to the story and reached out to NoiseCat to see if he\u2019d want to help. They became friends as cub reporters in New York who just happened to share neighboring desks.",
      "\u201cIn the years since, Julian had gone on to become an incredible writer and thinker and journalist focusing on indigenous life in North America. It felt like the natural fit,\u201d she said.",
      "While he was mulling it over, she went looking for a group to focus on and landed on St. Joseph\u2019s Mission near the Sugarcane Reservation of Williams Lake in British Columbia. Unbeknownst to her, that was the school NoiseCat's family attended. He\u2019d heard stories about his father being born nearby and found in a dumpster. Over the course of making the film they\u2019d discover that he was actually born in a dormitory and found in the school\u2019s incinerator.",
      "\u201cIt was a process for me to ultimately decide to tell the story in a personal and familial way,\u201d said NoiseCat, who during the making of the film lived with his father for the first time since he was around 6 years old.",
      "\u201cIt became very clear that he had these unaddressed questions from his birth and upbringing, and that I was in a position to help him ask those questions and in so doing, to address some of my own enduring pains and complications from his abandonment of me,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cThe big thing, though, was going to the Vatican with the late Chief Rick Gilbert and witnessing his incredible bravery.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just been incredibly fortunate that this film has had real impact,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cI was really scared that telling such a personal and sometimes painful story might be a harmful thing. But really, thankfully, it\u2019s been a healing thing, not just for my family and our participants, but for Indian Country more broadly.\u201d",
      "Over the last year as the film has played at various festivals and for Indigenous communities on reservations, Kassie said that more survivors have been coming forward with their stories.",
      "In October, former President Joe Biden also formally apologized to Native Americans for the \u201csin\u201d of a government-run boarding school system that for decades forcibly separated children from their parents, calling it a \u201cblot on American history.\"",
      "\u201cThis is the origin story of North America,\u201d Kassie said. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of how the land was taken by separating six generations of kids, indigenous kids from their families... (and) most people don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Kassie noted that while \u201cSugarcane\u201d is inspiring conversations within communities, it comes at a political moment where governments are not actively supporting continued investigation and accountability.",
      "In a film industry with deep roots in the Western genre and problematic, racist depictions of Native Americans as impediments to westward expansion, authentic representation of indigenous stories on screen is still in the early days. In 97 years of the Oscars, no Native American person has ever won a competitive acting prize. Lily Gladstone, who is an executive producer on \u201cSugarcane,\u201d was passed over last year for best actress.",
      "When the Oscar nomination came through for \u201cSugarcane,\u201d they made sure they had their facts right before touting its own historic nature: NoiseCat was indeed the first indigenous North American filmmaker to get one.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really special,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the same time, it\u2019s kind of shocking.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe hope the film shows that there\u2019s still so much about this foundational story in North America that needs to be known and therefore needs to be investigated,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cThis film should be seen not as an ending, but a beginning to a real grappling with this story.\u201d",
      "He added: \"More broadly, there are so many painful, important, beautiful and sometimes even triumphant stories that come from Native people that come from Indian Country. It\u2019s my hope that more Native stories and storytellers and films get recognized moving forward and get made.\u201d",
      "If \u201cSugarcane\u201d is named the winner at the Oscars on March 2, NoiseCat promised it will be an acceptance speech to watch.",
      "\u201cWe will make it a moment,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cIf we win, I\u2019m going to get up there, I\u2019m going to say something, and we\u2019re going to do it well too.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Golden State Warriors are known for their electrifying plays and superstar Stephen Curry, but now the team is pioneering a fresh gameplan: blending sports and entertainment in a way no NBA franchise has before.",
      "As the first and only NBA team with its own record label, Golden State Entertainment, the Warriors are expanding their reach with \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a new album released this week. The project featuring the Bay Area\u2019s top music artists \u2014 from E-40, Too Short, Saweetie, G-Eazy, Goapele, LaRussell and Larry June \u2014 arrives just in time for the league's All-Star Game weekend in San Francisco.",
      "\u201cA basketball team with a record label is unheard of until now, which is a testament to the Warriors and the Bay,\u201d said P-Lo, a Filipino-American rapper who produced \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a collaborative release between Golden State Entertainment and EMPIRE, a distribution and publishing company. He will perform live during an NBA All-Star tipoff party on Thursday at Thrive City, a 11-acre community gathering space surrounding the Chase Center.",
      "\u201cThis is about innovation, bringing a new idea to the table,\u201d said P-Lo, a lifelong Warriors fan who has worked with artists such as Yo Gotti, Saweetie and Kehlani.

      "\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of authentic and natural to the culture,\u201d said Kelly, who joined the organization in 2011 and currently is the chief business officer of Golden State Entertainment. \u201cIt seems like a lot of times people try to force them apart or mesh them together that don\u2019t make sense. But if you grew up a part of both, they naturally intertwine.\u201d",
      "Kelly first pitched the idea of the Warriors having a record label to then-president Rick Welts before bringing it to the team\u2019s owner, Joe Lacob, and co-executive chairman Peter Guber. He said the Warriors' leadership embraced his vision, and he hopes more pro teams will follow suit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s seeing the culture being presented in a way that\u2019s true and reflective on a grand international scale,\u201d said Kelly, a former Chicago-based rapper, whose stage name was Capital D. \u201cHopefully this is the first of many for Golden State and the culture.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 02:52:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Lawyers will give their closing arguments at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of two felony counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm",
    "story": [
      "Lawyers will give their closing arguments at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of two felony counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm",
      "LOS ANGELES -- There's one essential difference between arguments at rapper A$AP Rocky 's trial: Prosecutors will say Thursday that the hip-hop star fired two shots at a former friend from a handgun, while defense lawyers will say he fired blanks from a gun that wasn't real.",
      "Jurors should begin deliberations by the afternoon on two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm for the 2021 shooting. If they convict Rocky of both, he could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The Grammy-nominated music star, fashion mogul and actor is the longtime partner of singing superstar Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons. She may appear in court for closing arguments after showing up sporadically \u2014 most recently last week, when they left the courthouse together for the first time, walking arm-in-arm.",
      "Testimony at the trial ended Tuesday, when Rocky and his lawyers told a judge he would not take the stand.",
      "The prosecution's case rests largely on the credibility of the man Rocky is alleged to have fired on. A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, became friends with Rocky, born Rakim Mayers, in high school in New York, where both were members of a crew of creative types called the A$AP Mob.",
      "Their friendship continued after Rocky first gained global fame with a pair of No. 1 albums in 2012 and 2013, but by Nov. 6, 2021 their bond had become a beef.",
      "They met up outside a Hollywood hotel, and scuffled as soon as they saw each other. In a second confrontation moments later, Rocky fired the shots. Relli said his knuckles were grazed by one of them. The fights were partially captured on surveillance videos that are not clear enough for easy interpretation.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy, another member of the crew who was with Rocky, testified that Relli had been the aggressor, and that Rocky fired the shots as a warning to stop him from attacking another member of their crew.",
      "Twelvyy testified that Rocky fired blanks from a starter pistol that the rapper had been carrying for security since a music video shoot months earlier, and that everyone involved in the incident knew it. Rocky's tour manager also testified that he carried the phony gun.",
      "Neither gun was found or presented as evidence.",
      "Police who searched the area after a report of a shooting found no physical evidence, but Relli himself went to a police department two days later with two shell casings he said he'd picked up after returning to the scene.",
      "In closing arguments, the defense will contend that video evidence and text messages can't be trusted, nor can Relli. He also filed a civil suit in the case, and Rocky's attorneys will cast him as a jealous opportunist out for the money of a former friend who became famous. Relli vowed to do just that in text messages and in phone calls recorded by a mutual friend who gave the recordings to Rocky. Relli said in his testimony that the calls were faked.",
      "The prosecution will argue that Relli is justly seeking money after a genuine wrong was done to him. They point out that Relli's communications around the incident tell a consistent story \u2014 and never does he mention making anything up or knowing Rocky carried a prop gun. Prosecutors are likely to argue that the whole idea of the starter pistol \u2014 which only fires blanks \u2014 is a preposterous lie coordinated by Rocky's inner circle.",
      "In one of a series of arguments between lawyers that grew so nasty and personal during the trial that the judge began threatening fines, Deputy District Attorney John Lewin called the prop gun argument \u201cgarbage.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "At 100 years old, the Goodyear Blimp is an ageless star in the sky",
      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Flying a few hundred feet above the streets and shores of Daytona Beach, the Goodyear Blimp draws a crowd.",
      "Onlookers stare and point. Drivers pull over for better looks, snapping pictures, recording videos and trying to line up the perfect selfie. For some, it\u2019s nostalgic. For others, it\u2019s a glimpse at a larger-than-life advertising icon.",
      "At 100 years old, the blimp is an ageless star in the sky. And the 246-foot-long airship will be in the background of the Daytona 500 on Sunday \u2014 roughly 1,500 feet above Daytona International Speedway, actually \u2014 to celebrate its latest and greatest anniversary tour.",
      "Even though remote camera technologies \u2014 drones, mostly \u2014 are improving regularly and changing the landscape of aerial footage, the blimp continues to carve out a niche. At Daytona, with the usual 40-car field racing around a 2\u00bd-mile superspeedway, views from the blimp aptly provide the scope of the event.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to show the pack racing,\u201d Fox Sports director Artie Kempner said, adding that he expected to use aerial shots from the blimp about 50 times during Sunday\u2019s race.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform. It\u2019s been at every Daytona 500 since 1962.",
      "During that streak, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology, safety innovations, high-definition cameras, gyro-stabilized aerial views and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers.",
      "Nowadays, riding on the blimp isn\u2019t much different from traveling on a small plane. The 12-seater comes with reclining seats, tray tables, seatbelts, a safety briefing and a bathroom with amazing views. A few windows serve as the only air conditioning onboard. The blimp offers a smooth ride even at top speed, creeping along at 73 mph \u2014 well below the cars pushing 200 mph on the track.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an iconic symbol for our nation, a floating piece of Americana,\u201d blimp pilot Jensen Kervern said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it in the world.\u201d",
      "The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear. Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, and rapper Ice Cube raised the blimp\u2019s street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled \u201cIt Was A Good Day.\u201d",
      "But not just anyone can climb aboard. Rides are invitation only even though phones at blimp headquarters \u2014 the three U.S.-based airships are housed in California, Florida and Ohio \u2014 ring off the hook with people inquiring about buying a ride.",
      "As part of the blimp\u2019s 100-year anniversary celebration, however, Goodyear is giving three U.S. residents a chance to join the exclusive club and win a ride. The sweepstakes will provide each winner a certificate for two to fly on the blimp. The prize also includes $3,000 for travel expenses to one of Goodyear\u2019s airship hangars.",
      "It would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, no doubt.",
      "The blimp flies low enough to spot pods of dolphins or flotillas of sea turtles in the Atlantic Ocean. The view over Daytona International Speedway is equally stunning, with the ability to see every inch of the famed track while watching (and hearing) race cars turning laps.",
      "Already in 2025, the Goodyear fleet has flown over the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Pro Bowl and Pebble Beach. Its upcoming schedule includes the Academy Awards, Coachella and WrestleMania.",
      "But will the blimp survive another 100 years?",
      "Drone imagery and resolution continue to improve along with maneuverability, stability and flight longevity. And where drones can be flown by one person, the Goodyear Blimp crew at Daytona tops 20 staffers.",
      "But given the blimp\u2019s longevity, adaptability and celebrity, no one should bet against it sticking around for generations to come.",
      "\u201cDespite changes in technology and our environment, people still get so excited to see the blimp,\" Kervern said. \u201cIt's just an iconic symbol for our nation.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court has upheld singer R. Kelly's racketeering convictions and a 30-year prison sentence, finding he exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women",
      "NEW YORK -- R. Kelly\u2019s racketeering and sex trafficking convictions, along with a 30-year prison sentence, were upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court that concluded the singer exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women.",
      "The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled Wednesday after hearing arguments last March.",
      "The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling R&B songwriter was convicted in 2021 in Brooklyn federal court of multiple charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking.",
      "Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, representing R. Kelly, said in a statement that she believed the Supreme Court will agree to hear an appeal. She called the 2nd Circuit ruling \u201cunprecedented,\" saying it gives prosecutors limitless discretion to apply the racketeering law \u201cto situations absurdly remote\u201d from the statute's intent.",
      "Last year, the high court declined to hear an appeal of a 20-year sentence Kelly received after he was convicted in 2022 of child sex charges including charges of producing images of child sexual abuse in Chicago.",
      "The 2nd Circuit rejected Kelly's arguments that the trial evidence was inadequate, the constitutionality of some state laws used against him were questionable, four jurors were biased, the trial judge made some improper rulings and a racketeering charge more commonly used in organized crime cases was improper.",
      "\u201cEnabled by a constellation of managers, assistants, and other staff for over twenty-five years, Kelly exploited his fame to lure girls and young women into his grasp,\u201d the appeals court said, noting members of his entourage helped introduce him to underage girls.",
      "\u201cEvidence at trial showed that he would isolate them from friends and family, control nearly every aspect of their lives, and abuse them verbally, physically, and sexually,\u201d the three-judge panel said.",
      "The appeals court said it was \u201cneither arbitrary nor irrational\u201d that several accusers were permitted to testify at trial that Kelly gave them herpes without disclosing he had an STD, and it was not unduly prejudicial or cumulative that seven witnesses who were not yet adults when Kelly began to abuse them were allowed to testify.",
      "\u201cNone of the testimony was more inflammatory than the charged acts,\u201d the appeals court said.",
      "The 2nd Circuit also said it was not unfairly prejudicial for the trial judge to let jurors view graphic videos. The videos, the appeals court said, \u201cwere properly admitted to show the means and methods of the enterprise, including the level of control and dominance Kelly had over his victims.\u201d",
      "Bonjean, in her statement on R. Kelly's behalf, also cited a partial dissent in which one 2nd Circuit judge, Richard J. Sullivan, concurred with what he described as the majority's \u201cexcellent opinion,\u201d but dissented in part over a restitution award given one victim for a lifetime supply of a suppressive regime of herpes medication. The award was based on the cost of the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available.",
      "\u201cThis was not restitution. This was an effort by the government to unfairly enrich government witnesses for their testimony,\u201d Bonjean said.",
      "Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is known for work including the 1996 hit \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d and the cult classic \u201cTrapped in the Closet,\u201d a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue.",
      "Kelly sold millions of albums and remained in demand even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He was acquitted of child sexual abuse image charges in Chicago in 2008, but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his conviction on charges of producing images of child sexual abuse and enticing girls for sex.",
      "Widespread outrage over Kelly\u2019s sexual misconduct did not emerge until the #MeToo reckoning, reaching a crescendo after the release of the documentary \u201cSurviving R. Kelly.\u201d",

Kierny agreed and set a Feb. 18 date for it. Kierny said she thought Davis was absent because he was in the other hearing.",
      "The trial is scheduled to begin in March.",
      "A grand jury indicted Davis separately last week on charges of battery and challenging someone to a fight, moving that case from Justice Court to state District Court. He is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.",
      "A correctional officer told grand jurors that he was escorting Davis back to his unit when he and the other man exchanged words and then started fighting in a common room, according to the Review-Journal. Davis\u2019 legal team said he was ambushed and acted in self-defense.",
      "In the Shakur case, Arnold argues that Davis never should have been charged because of immunity agreements that Davis says he reached years ago with federal and local prosecutors while living in California.",
      "Kierny has said Davis is not protected from prosecution because he lacks proof of any such agreements.",
      "Prosecutors say they have strong evidence against him, including his own accounts of the shooting in a tell-all memoir. Davis, an ex-gang leader, is accused of orchestrating the killing near the Las Vegas Strip."

      "The lawsuit filed Wednesday in New York state court says the documentary, \u201c Diddy: Making of a Bad Boy,\u201d included statements that NBC Universal either knew were false or published with reckless disregard for the truth in order to defame the founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\u201cIndeed, the entire premise of the Documentary assumes that Mr. Combs has committed numerous heinous crimes, including serial murder, rape of minors, and sex trafficking of minors, and attempts to crudely psychologize him,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cIt maliciously and baselessly jumps to the conclusion that Mr. Combs is a \u2018monster\u2019 and \u2018an embodiment of Lucifer\u2019 with \u2018a lot of similarities\u2019 to Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d",

      "Paul McCartney has staged a surprise performance before a small crowd in New York",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Paul McCartney\u2019s previous New York-area performance took place three years ago at MetLife Stadium, capacity 82,500. His surprise show Tuesday night at the Bowery Ballroom fit, at most, 575.",
      "It was probably less than that since McCartney\u2019s sound board and gear \u2014 too much to fit backstage \u2014 occupied a portion of the floor space at the venerable downtown theater. The whole thing felt like, and was, a lark. McCartney announced the show just hours before taking the stage.",
      "Like an echo of Beatlemania, the news swept through Manhattan and beyond earlier in the day, sending New Yorkers sprinting down Delancey Street for a chance to snag one of the few tickets at the Bowery. Most in attendance, including McCartney, himself, could hardly believe it was happening.",
      "\u201cSo, here we are,\u201d McCartney said, grinning. \u201cSome little gig. New York. Why not?\u201d",
      "Later, he added before launching into \u201cLet Me Roll It\u201d: \u201cI can\u2019t quite believe we\u2019re here, doing this. But we are here, doing this.\u201d",
      "It was not McCartney\u2019s first impromptu concert. The Beatles, of course, famously performed atop the roof of their Apple Corps headquarters at 3 Savile Row in London in 1969. Since then he\u2019s made something of a habit of it on trips to New York.",
      "In 2009, McCartney returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater, site of the Beatles\u2019 famous U.S. debut, and performed above the marquee. In 2018, he popped up in Grand Central Terminal to promote the release of his \u201cEgyptian Station.\u201d",
      "With temperatures in the low 30s on Tuesday, McCartney, 82, this time opted for an intimate, indoor show. Tickets were sold only physically at the venue, one per person. All were snapped up within about 30 minutes.",
      "For those quick enough, it was like hitting the lottery.",
      "Amy Jaffe, 69, was at home about 30 blocks north when she saw the announcement on Instagram. \u201cI thought: I can do this,\u201d Jaffe said before the show. \u201cI put on jeans, grabbed a coat, called a Lyft.\u201d",
      "Jaffe has seen McCartney many times before, including with the Beatles in 1964 in Forrest Hills, Queens. But she was still incredulous, smiling and shaking her head: \u201cI don\u2019t actually believe it.\u201d",
      "Phil Sokoloff, 31, was on his way to work nearby when he saw the news. He ran in and told his co-worker, Mat Fuller, and they rushed over to the Bowery Ballroom.",
      "\u201cWe just got lucky,\u201d Sokoloff said. \u201cI\u2019m always learning about these things the day after.\u201d",
      "McCartney took the stage roughly on time at 6:30 p.m. with his regular band, along with a three-member horn section. They had only rehearsed once, the day before, McCartney said. Someone shouted: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to rehearse!\u201d",
      "If the location was stripped down, the former Beatle didn\u2019t come with a minimized show, packing in a blistering tour through his entire catalog, from Beatles classics to Wings hits. He began with \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d and also performed \u201cGot To Get You Into My Life,\u201d \u201cMaybe I\u2019m Amazed,\u201d \u201cLady Madonna,\u201d \u201cJet,\u201d \u201cGet Back,\u201d \u201cOb-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\u201d \u201cLet it Be\u201d and \u201cHey Jude.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlackbird\u201d was a solo number on acoustic guitar, and afterward McCartney reflected on how he wrote it for the Civil Rights Movement, a memory that brought back his first trips to the United States.",
      "\u201cWe were just kids,\u201d McCartney said. \u201cI\u2019ve got grandchildren older than that now.\u201d",
      "In the early days, he said, he and John Lennon were always writing for the audience, and the songs were all about reaching out: \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand,\u201d \u201cFrom Me to You.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt had everything to do with the fans, really,\u201d McCartney said.",
      "Before playing the Wings song \u201cMrs. Vanderbilt,\u201d McCartney spoke of playing it in front of 350,000 people in Kyiv, when Ukraine was exuberant with a newfound freedom. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it gets back to that soon,\u201d he said.",
      "Conversation, mixed with shouts from the audience, peppered the set. After one particularly shrill scream, McCartney responded. \u201cThat was a Beatles scream.\u201d Then he asked for more, saying, \u201cOK, let\u2019s get it out of the way. Girls, give me a Beatles scream.\u201d All in attendance obliged.",
      "McCartney also performed the so-called last Beatles song, \u201c Now and Then,\u201d a ballad penned by Lennon in the late \u201970s but only released in 2023 with the help of the some of the technology used in Peter Jackson\u2019s 2021 documentary, \u201c The Beatles: Get Back.\u201d The song made McCartney wistful for his songwriting partner, whom he noted loved New York.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s hear it for John,\u201d he said.",
      "McCartney, who was spotted Sunday at the Super Bowl in New Orleans chatting with Adam Sandler, was in New York for the upcoming \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d 50th anniversary festivities. He\u2019s to be a guest on the star-studded television special Sunday.",
      "It was unclear if McCartney was playing a single show or preparing for something more. He wrapped the Got Back Tour in December and has said he\u2019s hoping to finish a new album this year.",
      "For now, though, it was a one-night-only event. One crowd member asked McCartney if it could go all night. \u201cSome of us need to get some sleep, you know,\u201d he replied.",
      "McCartney still came back, bouncing on the stage for an encore. He closed with the rousing \u201cAbbey Road\u201d send off of \u201cCarry That Weight\u201d and \u201cThe End,\u201d concluded with its immortalized final lines: \u201cAnd in the end/ The love you take/ Is equal to the love you make.\u201d",
      "The crowd, still in disbelief, spilled out into the street. Snow had begun to fall.",

      "The inner-Vatican machinations of \u201cConclave\u201d have nothing on this year\u2019s Oscar race",
      "NEW YORK -- The inner-Vatican machinations of \u201cConclave\u201d have nothing on this year\u2019s Oscar race.",
      "Just as Edward Berger\u2019s film juggles various candidates for the papacy, the race for best picture at the Academy Awards has seen one favorite replaced by another, and then another.",
      "While some clarity has lately emerged, with a handful of big wins for Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora,\u201d it seems likely to be a nail biter until a winner is declared at the March 2 Oscars, when white smoke unfurls from the Sistine Chapel, I mean the Dolby Theatre.",
      "As of now, \u201cAnora\u201d is the clear frontrunner thanks to wins with the Producers Guild and the Directors Guild \u2014 both prizes with a long history of predicting Oscar winners. Where the Screen Actors Guild and the BAFTAs fall will offer the last major clues.",
      "But unlike years like last year, when \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was way ahead wire to wire, no lead in this year\u2019s best picture race seems ironclad. So, with that in mind, here are the best picture nominees, ranked in order of least likely to win to most likely to win. It\u2019s telling that at least half of these films, with three weeks to go, still have a chance.",
      "If this was a ranking of merit, RaMell Ross\u2019s movie would be first. Ross\u2019 film, thrillingly and thoughtfully shot largely in first person, introduced a new filmic grammar to American movies. But \u201cNickel Boys\u201d was seemingly on the cusp of getting a nomination, so we should just be glad it\u2019s counted here among the best of the year.",
      "Denis Villeneuve\u2019s first Frank Herbert adaptation garnered 10 nominations and won six. \u201cPart Two\u201d hasn\u2019t been the same awards force. It\u2019s up for five nominations and will probably walk home with one or two Oscars, possibly for visual effects and sound. People like \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d but sequels tend to have a harder go of it at the Academy Awards. Blame it on the sandworms.",
      "Arguably no film has risen up the Oscar ranks more than Walter Salles\u2019 portrait of political resistance under Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. The film, a box-office sensation in its native country, was once one of the many international underdogs vying for a place at the Academy Awards. It won\u2019t win best picture, but it\u2019s a testament to the film\u2019s appeal that it could upset \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d in best international film.",
      "Coralie Fargeat\u2019s body-horror film has turned out to be much more of an Oscar contender than initially believed \u2014 certainly by Universal, which financed the film but sold it to Mubi to distribute. It\u2019s up for five awards but its best chance comes in the best actress category where Demi Moore is the favorite. Mikey Madison (\u201cAnora\u201d) and Fernanda Torres (\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d) could make that a close call, too, but Moore \u2014 propelled by her \u201cpopcorn actress\u201d narrative and the movie's biting showbiz satire \u2014 is the frontrunner.",
      "How far can a former frontrunner fall? Jacques Audiard\u2019s narco-musical leads all films with 13 nominations but the Netflix movie has been in freefall since its star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, became ensnarled by a scandal over old tweets. I\u2019m not completely counting \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d out \u2013 you don\u2019t get 13 nominations for nothing. But \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d a divisive movie to begin with, is now in the business of salvaging its chances in other categories, like best supporting actress, where Zoe Salda\u00f1a could win.",
      "Now we\u2019re into the top contenders. Most likely, the winner is coming from one of these next five. Jon M. Chu\u2019s Broadway adaptation might have the most moviegoers rooting for it to win, but it\u2019s missing some key ingredients for pulling out best picture. Chu missed on a nomination for best director and the \u201cWicked\u201d has mostly been out-musical-ed by \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d on the awards circuit. Still, \u201cWicked\u201d has cornered the market on the role of Big Studio Movie contender. However it does, the film academy is going to make sure \u201cWicked\u201d is front and center during the ceremony.",
      "Here we have our Everyone Likes It contender. Berger\u2019s papal thriller, starring Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal tasked with leading a conclave, feels like the most universally respected nominee. In a year where votes are spread across a lot of films, that might be a quality that \u2014 particularly considering the academy\u2019s preferential ballot \u2014 leaves \u201cConclave\u201d driving the Oscar home in a popemobile. What\u2019s the main knock against this happening, aside from the potential difficulty of renting a popemobile? Berger was passed over on a directing nomination, and \u201cConclave\u201d hasn\u2019t yet won a major award. More than any other movie, it needs a victory at the BAFTAs.",
      "James Mangold\u2019s Bob Dylan movie is also widely liked and lacks any precursor win. But admiration for \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d is widespread and it could, just as \u201cConclave\u201d might, pull out an upset by rising high on a plethora of ballots. Unlike \u201cConclave,\u201d Mangold was nominated for best director, though, and it has the benefit of being led by Hollywood\u2019s biggest young star, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Hollywood likes to, in picking a best picture winner, say something about its future. Chalamet's star power could be convincing enough. Plus Searchlight Pictures has previously steered quite a few best-picture winners (\"Nomadland,\" \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d). Mangold\u2019s movie has momentum, which, even if it doesn\u2019t lead to best picture, may propel Chalamet to best actor over Adrien Brody for \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "Until recently, Brady Corbet\u2019s postwar epic might have been the top pick. \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d has been an award-winner at Venice and the Golden Globes. It\u2019s up for 10 Oscars. It\u2019s roundly been hailed as visionary, hugely ambitious cinema \u2014 all made, remarkably, with a budget under $10 million. It\u2019s also three and a half hours long. Not every Oscar voter, I assure you, is watching it all the way through. That, though, might not be a bad thing for a movie that falls off in the second half.",
      "Half a year ago, \u201cAnora\u201d was the odds-on pick to win best picture and now, after a topsy-turvy awards season, it is again. A trio of wins \u2014 at the PGA Awards, the DGA Awards and Critics Choice \u2014 has reestablished \u201cAnora\u201d as the movie to beat.",
      "If it wins at the SAG Awards, too, the race is probably over. Not everything with similar credentials has won before, though; \u201c1917\u201d had the same wins before being defeated by \u201cParasite\u201d five years ago. \u201cAnora,\u201d however, also won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes, like \u201cParasite\u201d did, so it should do well among international voters \u2014 a crucial voting bloc in today's academy.",
      "It\u2019s also just really good. \u201cAnora\u201d comes from a widely respected filmmaker in Baker, a prominent defender of the theatrical release. And his movie, a sly and devastating twist on a \u201cPretty Woman\u201d-like fable, is as connected to Hollywood's celebrated '70s as it is to its indie filmmaking present.",

      "Sean Baker's Brooklyn comedy \u201cAnora\u201d took top honors at both the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards on Saturday night, catapulting it to Oscar favorite status with wins from a pair of closely watched Academy Awards precursors.",
      "Hollywood's award season has been uncharacteristically up for grabs with half a dozen films viewed as legitimate best-picture contenders. Some had pegged \u201cAnora\u201d as the frontrunner going into the season after the film, starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "But after a number of films took turns in the spotlight, including Golden Globe winners \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d and \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\" \u201cAnora\u201d reemerged in a big way over the weekend. Baker's film also won best picture at the Critics Choice Awards on Friday.",
      "Both guild ceremonies were held in Beverly Hills, California. The PGA's top prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck Award, has matched the Oscar winner for best picture in 16 of the last 21 years. Since 2009, when the guild and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences both adopted a preferential ballot to pick a winner from 10 nominees, they've corresponded all but three times.",
      "The DGA is similarly predictive. In the past 74 years, 66 winners have gone on to triumph at the Oscars. That makes Baker the favorite for best director in a field entirely composed of first-time nominees.",
      "The guild also named RaMell Ross' \u201cNickel Boys\" best first film. Ross' movie, nominated for best picture by the Oscars, is his narrative film debut.",
      "Oscar voting begins Tuesday. Jacques Audiard's \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\" is the lead nominee with 13 nominations, but the Netflix film has seen its chances crater following multiple waves of backlash and controversy.",

On Saturday at the Annie Awards, DreamWorks Animation's \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d cleaned up with nine awards including best film. \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d will be the heavy favorite to win best animated film at the March 2 Academy Awards."

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece.",
      "Bowers\u2019 work on \u201c The Wild Robot \u201d continues to solidify his place as one of Hollywood\u2019s most sought-after composers, earning him a nomination for best original score. His score complements the film\u2019s stunning visuals and emotional depth, capturing the journey of Roz, an out-of-place robot striving to connect with animals who struggle to understand it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about being really clear with each story, understanding what the emotions is and what\u2019s stirring inside of me,\u201d said Bowers, 35, a Grammy and Emmy-nominated composer who won an Academy Award for the short documentary \u201cThe Last Repair Shop.\u201d He\u2019s also worked on Oscar-winning films such as \u201cKing Richard\u201d and \u201c Green Book.\u201d",
      "For \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d Bowers first studied the early black-and-white sketches, where he uncovered his emotions toward the characters, before capturing those feelings at his piano, crafting a musical narrative filled with heart. Bowers said tapping into his emotions has never come easily, but he found inspiration in his journey as a father, watching his wife sacrifice her body during pregnancy, to help craft sounds that capture the essence of parenthood.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Bowers reflects on what the Oscar nomination means to him, the challenges of composing for animated films, the lasting influence of five-time Oscar winner John Williams and why Kobe Bryant \u2019s advice continues to resonate with him.",
      "The Oscars will air March 2.",
      "____",
      "BOWERS: It means a lot. As a kid, that's how I found a lot of composers. I was looking at that (Oscar noms) list. I would look at who's nominated then go listen to those scores, so it became a way to expand my collection of CDs. It means something to be a part of this history. No matter what happens in my career from here on out, somebody's going to look at this year's list and see my name. To be nominated, you are chosen by the music branch of the academy ... filled with composers who I've been a fan of since I was a kid. ... It makes me feel like I've done something meaningful.",
      "BOWERS: Yeah, he was the master of memorable melody. If there's a piece of score in a move that you can sing, it's probably John Williams. One thing I took from him is that he came up in a time of composers who were storytellers and made sure the music was also developing the story. When those themes come back at the most pivotal point in the movie, we feel something emotional. I remember for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I studied the last 30 minutes of \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\u201d primarily because the last 20-30 minutes of \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d is all action. I thought, \u201cHow did John Williams approach this?\" Because \u201cStar Wars\u201d was so iconic with its themes.",
      "BOWERS: The only moment was when I played the main theme. I was kind of just wanting to see if it triggered that complexity. I do this often with my wife where I\u2019ll have a theme that I\u2019m playing it and ask her \u201cWhat does this remind of, or what does this make you feel? I remember when I played her that sequence, which was a work in progress, and she got emotional. She cried watching just that three-minute sequence, having no idea of what the movie was about. I felt like I was on the right track. ... It\u2019s reminding her of all the complex emotions she feels as a mom. I struck a nerve in a way that could be valuable.",
      "BOWERS: It\u2019s definitely more challenging. If you talk to any composer, they\u2019ll talk about the fact that animation is its own challenge. Most animated films have almost wall-to-wall music where music kind of doesn\u2019t ever stop. Whereas, a lot of live action, you can sit for five minutes and not have any music and be OK.",
      "BOWERS: I did a lot of work for Kobe. He talked about John Williams being my Michael Jordan. He was all about obsessing enough about your craft, so that you are ready for anything. The stuff I wrote for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I learned from when he would challenge me to write. I wrote this audiobook for him, and he was like \u201cYou know this has to be better than the music for \u2018E.T.\u2019?",
      "I laughed. And he was like \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not (expletive) kidding with you, right?\u201d",
      "He was always telling me, \u201cIf you\u2019re not taking on something that\u2019s going to make you a better artist by the time you finish it, then you are wasting your time.\u201d",
      "That kind of mentality is the way I approach everything. I want to take on as many things as possible. If that opportunity came, I\u2019d be prepared for it.",
      "BOWERS: I feel like my parents put me on this track from the very beginning. They wanted me to play piano before I was born. They gave me lessons and like found teachers for me. There\u2019s kind of like this debt I owe to them. I have to be as great as I possibly can. But it\u2019s also just me trying to live up to the steps my parents already got started for me.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A performer at Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show unfurled a flag referencing both Sudan and the Gaza Strip, providing a brief protest referencing two wars shaking the Middle East.",
      "Security at the stadium detained the performer shortly after waving the flag atop a car used as a prop in the performance. It's unclear if the performer, as of yet unnamed by authorities, would face any charges. The NFL said the person would be banned for life from NFL stadiums and events, while the company behind the halftime show said it was not part of the planned performance.",
      "But what's happening in Gaza and Sudan? And how does it affect the wider world?",
      "The Associated Press explains what's going on.",
      "The Gaza Strip is an enclave along the Mediterranean Sea bordered by both Egypt and Israel. It's some 360 square kilometers (140 square miles) \u2014 about the twice the size of Washington and 3\u00bd times the size of Paris. But it's incredibly densely populated and was home to 2.3 million Palestinians before the start of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war.",
      "That war began when Hamas, a militant group that's ruled Gaza since 2007, stormed across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage. Israel responded with a devastating ground and air campaign striking across Gaza, killing more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between fighters and noncombatants in their count. Much of the territory has been obliterated.",
      "A ceasefire in the war began Jan. 19 and is still holding. Palestinian militants have freed hostages while Israel has released Palestinians held in prisons there. However, worries remains over whether the peace will hold. Comments by President Donald Trump, who was on hand Sunday night for the Super Bowl, suggesting the U.S. was \u201ccommitted to buying and owning Gaza,\u201d also have upended discussions about the enclave's future.",
      "The Palestinians want the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for a future state of their own, with east Jerusalem as its capital. That long-sought, two-state solution for the decadeslong conflict is backed by Mideast nations and much of the international community. Israel has expressed openness to the idea of resettling Gaza\u2019s population, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on Sunday calling it \u201da revolutionary, creative vision.\" Hamas, the Palestinians and much of the world have rejected it.",
      "Sudan, a nation in East Africa, has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces led a military coup in 2021.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "In recent weeks, Burhan's forces including Sudan's military and allied militias have advanced against the RSF. They retook a key refinery north of Khartoum, Sudan's capital. They've also pushed in on RSF positions around Khartoum itself. That fighting has led to an increase in civilian casualties. From Jan. 31 until Feb. 5, the U.N.s' Human Rights Office documented at least 275 civilian deaths from artillery, airstrikes and drone assaults.",
      "\u201cIndiscriminate attacks, as well as threats and attacks directed against civilians must cease immediately,\u201d said Seif Magango, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Office. \u201cThe Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces \u2014 and their allied movements and militias \u2014 must respect their international law obligations and take concrete steps to protect civilians from harm, including humanitarian workers and human rights defenders.\u201d",
      "Online, activists have sought to draw attention to both the Gaza Strip and Sudan, though the conflicts have different roots and participants. However, the idea of the two conflicts being linked by their devastation has been made by celebrities.",
      "In August, American rapper Macklemore said he canceled a concert in Dubai over the United Arab Emirates\u2019 role \u201cin the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis\u201d in Sudan through its reported support of the paramilitary force that\u2019s been fighting government troops there. While the UAE repeatedly has denied arming the RSF, U.N. experts reported \u201ccredible\u201d evidence last year showed that the Emirates sent weapons to the RSF several times a week from northern Chad.",
      "Macklemore at the time said he reconsidered the show in part over his recent, public support of Palestinians over the Israel-Hamas war. He has been performing a song called \u201cHind\u2019s Hall,\u201d in honor of a young girl named Hind Rajab killed in Gaza in a shooting Palestinians have blamed on Israeli forces opening fire on a civilian car."

Of the 100 top domestic grossing films in 2024, 42% had female protagonists, and 42% had male protagonists, according to a report issued by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University.",
      "The USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which also released its annual study Tuesday, found that 54% of the top 100 films at the box office in 2024 featured girls and women as protagonists. That's a massive jump from just the year prior, when 30% of films featured women in lead roles. In 2007, when the USC annual study began, that figure was just 20%.",
      "\"This is the first time we can say that gender equality has been reached in top-grossing films,\u201d Stacy L. Smith, founder of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIn 2024, three of the top five films had a girl or woman in a leading role, as did five of the top 10 films \u2014 including the number one film of the year, Disney\u2019s \u2018Inside Out 2,\u2019\" added Smith. \"We have always known that female-identified leads would make money. This is not the result of an economic awakening but is due to a number of different constituencies and efforts \u2014 at advocacy groups, at studios, through DEI initiatives \u2014 to assert the need for equality on screen.\u201d",
      "Other metrics suggested the gains in leading roles masked still-endemic disparity throughout Hollywood. The percentage of female characters in speaking roles increased from 35% to 37% in 2024, according to the San Diego State study. Major female characters rose from 38% in 2023 to 39% in 2024.",
      "\u201cFilms such as \u2018The Substance\u2019 pushed back hard against a culture that considers women disposable,\u201d Lauzen stated. \u201cWhile the number of films with female protagonists rose to a historic high in 2024 after a dismally lean 2023, the percentages of women in the more stable categories of major and speaking roles reflected only minor gains.\u201d",
      "Universal Studios, which is led by Donna Langley, was the studio with the best record for female representation. In 2024, 66.7% of Universal releases centered on girls and women, according to the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.",
      "Neither study captures the large number of films released directly on streaming platforms or films that fall outside the top 100 movies in theaters. But for decades, those top box-office films have offered a snapshot of a film industry that has long failed to come close to reflecting the demographics of American society.",
      "That remains the case for underrepresented racial or ethnic groups, who account for roughly 42% of the U.S. population.",
      "In the top 2024 films in 2024, 25% included an underrepresented lead or co-lead, according to Annenberg. In those 25 movies, the lead or co-leads were 38.% Black, 15.4% Asian or Asian American and 3.9% Hispanic.",
      "That was a substantial decrease from 2023, when 37 leads or co-leads were people of color.",
      "\u201cThe progress we saw for female-identified leads was not matched by the findings for underrepresented leads,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThis downturn signifies a lack of investment in storytelling that reflects the audience as a whole. The reality is that audiences want to see stories about women and people of color \u2014 studios and filmmakers do not have to choose between the two.\u201d"

      "Marin was just 34 when elected in 2019, as part of a center-left coalition that made history by being led entirely by women. She became known internationally for her opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and for Finland's rapid entry into NATO, ending a policy of neutrality that had been in place since the end of World War II.",
      "At times, her private life made news. In August 2022, she apologized after the publication of a photo that showed two women kissing and posing topless at the prime minister's official summer residence. Earlier, a video of Marin dancing and singing with friends prompted a debate about how a head of state should behave during her leisure time and whether women were held to a different standard.",

      "Tom Robbins, the literary prankster-philosopher who charmed, enlightened and addled millions of readers with such adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Tom Robbins, the novelist and prankster-philosopher who charmed and addled millions of readers with such screwball adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died. He was 92.",
      "Robbins\u2019 death was confirmed by his friend, the publishing executive Craig Popelars, who said the author died Sunday morning.",
      "Pronouncing himself blessed with \"crazy wisdom,\" Robbins published eight novels and the memoir \"Tibetan Peach Pie\" and looked fondly upon his world of deadpan absurdity, authorial commentary and zig zag story lines. No one had a wilder imagination, whether giving us a wayward heroine with elongated thumbs in \"Cowgirls\" or landing the corpse of Jesus in a makeshift zoo in \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" And no one told odder jokes on himself: Robbins once described his light, scratchy drawl as sounding \"as if it's been strained through Davy Crockett's underwear.\"",
      "He could fathom almost anything except growing up. People magazine would label Robbins \"the perennial flower child and wild blooming Peter Pan of American letters,\" who \"dips history's pigtails in weird ink and splatters his graffiti over the face of modern fiction.\"",
      "A native of Blowing Rock, North Carolina who moved to Virginia and was named \"Most Mischievous Boy\" by his high school, Robbins could match any narrative in his books with one about his life. There was the time he had to see a proctologist and showed up wearing a duck mask. (The doctor and Robbins became friends). He liked to recall the food server in Texas who unbuttoned her top and revealed a faded autograph, his autograph.",
      "Or that odd moment in the 1990s when the FBI sought clues to the Unabomber's identity by reading Robbins' novel \"Still Life with Woodpecker.\" Robbins would allege that two federal agents, both attractive women, were sent to interview him.",
      "\"The FBI is not stupid!\" he liked to say. \"They knew my weakness!\"",
      "He also managed to meet a few celebrities, thanks in part to the film adaptation of \"Even Cowgirls,\" which starred Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves, and to appearances in such movies as \"Breakfast of Champions\" and \"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle.\" He wrote of being Debra Winger's date to the 1991 Academy Awards ceremony and nearly killing himself at an Oscars after-party when \u2014 hoping to impress Al Pacino \u2014 he swallowed a glass of cologne. He had happier memories of checking into a hotel and being recognized by a young, pretty clerk, who raved about his work and ignored the man standing next to him, Neil Young.",
      "In Robbins\u2019 novels, the quest was all and he helped capture the wide open spirit of the 1960s in part because he knew the life so well. He dropped acid, hitchhiked coast to coast, traveled from Tanzania to the Himalayas and carried on with friends and strangers in ways he had no right to survive. He didn't rely on topical references to mark time, but on understanding the era from the inside.",
      "\"Faulkner had his inbred Southern gothic freak show, Hemingway his European battlefields and cafes, Melville his New England with its tall ships,\" he wrote in his memoir, published in 2014. \"I had, it finally dawned on me, a cultural phenomenon such as the world had not quite seen before, has not seen since; a psychic upheaval, a paradigm shift, a widespread if ultimately unsustainable egalitarian leap in consciousness. And it was all very up close and personal.\"",
      "His path to fiction writing had its own rambling, hallucinatory quality. He was a dropout from Washington and Lee University (Tom Wolfe was a classmate) who joined the Air Force because he didn't know what else to do. He moved to the Pacific Northwest in the early '60s and somehow was assigned to review an opera for the Seattle Times, becoming the first classical music critic to liken Rossini to Robert Mitchum. Robbins would soon find himself in a farcical meeting with conductor Milton Katims, making conversation by pretending he was working on his own libretto, \"The Gypsy of Issaquah,\" named for a Seattle suburb.",
      "\"You must admit it had an operatic ring,\" Robbins insisted.",
      "By the late 1960s, publishers were hearing about his antics and thought he might have a book in him. A Doubleday editor met with Robbins and agreed to pay $2,500 for what became \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" Published in 1971, Robbins' debut novel sold little in hardcover despite praise from Graham Greene and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, but became a hit in paperback. \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" came out in 1976 and eventually sold more than 1 million copies.",
      "\"Read solemnly, with expectations of conventional coherence, \u2018Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\u2019 will disappoint,\" Thomas LeClair wrote in The New York Times. \"Entered like a garage sale, poked through and picked over, \u2018Cowgirls\u2019 is entertaining and, like the rippled mirror over there by the lawn mower, often instructive. Tom Robbins is one of our best practitioners of high foolishness.\u201d",
      "Domestic stability was another prolonged adventure; one ex-girlfriend complained \u201cThe trouble with you, Tom, is that you have too much fun.\u201d He was married and divorced twice, and had three children, before settling down with his third wife, Alexa d'Avalon, who appeared in the film version of \u201cEven Cowgirls Get the Blues.\u201d",
      "Robbins' other books included \"Half Asleep in Frogs Pajamas,\" \"Fierce Invalids Home from Home Climates,\" \u201cVilla Incognito.\u201d His honors included the Bumbershoot Golden Umbrella Award for Lifetime Achievement and being named by Writer's Digest as among the 100 best authors of the 20th century. But he cherished no praise more than a letter received from an unnamed woman.",
      "\"Your books make me laugh, they make think, they make me horny,\" his fan informed him, \u201cand they make me aware of all the wonder in the world.\u201d"

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Abortions are set to resume in Missouri after a judge blocked regulations that had restricted providers even after voters approved enshrining abortion rights into the state\u2019s constitution.",
      "Friday's ruling came after a Kansas City judge ruled last year that abortions were now legal in the state but kept certain regulations on the books while a lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates played out.",
      "One regulation required abortion facilities to be licensed by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Planned Parenthood said most of its facilities could not comply with some of the licensing rules, including \u201cmedically irrelevant\u201d size requirements for hallways, rooms and doors.",
      "Planned Parenthood argued that the licensing law required providers to give \u201cmedically unnecessary and invasive\u201d pelvic exams to anyone receiving an abortion, including medication abortions, according to court documents. The plaintiffs also said some of the regulations on Planned Parenthood centers were so strict, \u201cmost health centers or doctors\u2019 office simply do not meet\u201d them.",
      "Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang said in her ruling that the licensing requirement is \u201cfacially discriminatory because it does not treat services provided in abortion facilities the same as other types of similarly situated health care, including miscarriage care.\u201d",
      "Voters approved the measure adding abortion rights to the constitution in November. That amendment did not legalize abortion in the state outright but instead required judges to reconsider laws that had almost completely banned the procedure.",
      "Margot Riphagen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, said the group is working quickly to start providing the procedure again in the coming days.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision affirms what we\u2019ve already long known \u2014 the state\u2019s abortion facility licensing requirements were not about patient safety, but rather another politically motivated barrier to prevent patients seeking abortion from getting the care they need,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "The ruling is a temporary order pending the outcome of the lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates.",
      "Planned Parenthood and other advocates sued to overturn Missouri\u2019s near-total abortion ban almost immediately after voters amended the constitution to protect reproductive rights. Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey is fighting the lawsuit.",
      "There was no immediate response to a voice message seeking comment from a spokesperson for the attorney general.",
      "Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, said clinic partners are ready to start providing abortions as soon as next week.",
      "\u201cWith this change the landscape for Missourians and the entire Midwest region will be transformed, as patients will have greater access to abortion care than they have had in years,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in 2024 to enshrining abortion rights in their constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment but will need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect.",
      "Another measure banning discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. While there is no defined time frame, doctors say it is generally sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy.",

Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it\u2019s usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.",

      "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a busy soccer calendar",
      "LONDON -- Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a congested soccer calendar.",
      "Arteta said he felt a \u201cbig pain in the tummy\u201d after seeing Kai Havertz pick up a serious hamstring injury at the end of a light training session in Dubai that will rule the Germany forward out for the rest of the season.",
      "It further stretches Arsenal\u2019s resources up front, with Gabriel Jesus having ruptured his ACL, winger Bukayo Saka having not played since December because of a hamstring issue and another wide player, Gabriel Martinelli, set to miss the next month also with a hamstring injury.",
      "Two more games per team were added to the first stage of this season's Champions League, while Arsenal also went deep in the English League Cup \u2014 it was eliminated by Newcastle in the two-legged semifinals \u2014 and is in a title race with Liverpool in the Premier League.",
      "An expanded and revamped Club World Cup, which takes place in the United States at the end of the season and lasts a month, also extends the schedule for many teams, though not Arsenal this year. Some players have openly complained that it is detrimental to their performance and health and the busy match schedule is facing legal challenges and the possibility of strike action.",
      "For Arteta, it\u2019s no surprise to see injury rates soar at Arsenal because of the extra load on players and what he perceives to be an increased intensity in modern-day soccer.",
      "\u201cYou cannot prove it and the evidence we can provide is very limited in many aspects and every case is very different but already some of them (injuries) we know are based on load and minutes. It's inevitable,\u201d Arteta said Friday. \u201cWe have players who have been injured who have played 130 games over the last two seasons. In the end, it\u2019s an accident waiting to happen if you continue to load and load and load.",
      "\u201cIs this season an accumulation of that? Is it the stress of that? Is it luck? Is it preparation? Is it methodology? There are a lot of factors. It\u2019s very difficult to point at something but the schedule that's planned is super-demanding and for certain players, especially explosive players, it\u2019s a real issue.\u201d",
      "Havertz appears to have been unlucky in picking up his injury, with Arteta explaining how the German stretched his leg to stop a shot at a set-piece and \u201cfelt his hamstring go.\u201d",
      "Given the number of injuries sustained by Arsenal players this season \u2014 others to have had long spells out include Ben White, Martin Odegaard, Riccardo Calafiori and Takehiro Tomiyasu \u2014 some have questioned whether Arteta\u2019s training methods are to blame.",
      "Maybe that was the reason why Arteta was eager to point out that Arsenal\u2019s players now \u201ctrain less than ever\u201d and go into a deeper explanation about how too many games \u2014 and, as a result, not enough training \u2014 affects players\u2019 recovery.",
      "\u201cThe muscle is undertrained and then you expose the muscle and the tendon to an exposure that they cannot absorb because the tendon needs 72 hours to recover,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cA lot of people talk about what we're doing outside. It\u2019s not outside, it\u2019s inside.",
      "\u201cWhen you have to load that muscle for two or three or six or eight weeks that you haven\u2019t in training, the risk of injury is much bigger \u2014 one, because the tendon is not recovered, and then it\u2019s not prepared to absorb the load and stress you are going to put it under every three days.\u201d",

      "A department spokesperson confirmed Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham had ordered his staff to stop engaging in media campaigns and community health fairs to encourage vaccinations, even as the state has experienced a surge in influenza.",
      "Abraham's announcement occurred the same day vaccine skepticRobert F. Kennedy Jr. was sworn in by the U.S. Senate to serve as President Donald Trump's health secretary.",
      "In a separate letter posted on the department's website, Louisiana's surgeon general decried \u201cblanket government mandates\u201d for vaccines and criticized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID-19 vaccination push. Individuals should make their own decisions about vaccinations, Abraham said.",
      "\u201cGovernment should admit the limitations of its role in people\u2019s lives and pull back its tentacles from the practice of medicine,\u201d said Abraham, a Republican.",
      "The department will still \u201cstock and provide vaccines,\" according to Abraham's memo.",
      "Jennifer Herricks, founder of the advocacy group Louisiana Families for Vaccines, said she feared that the new directive would lead to an increase in preventable illnesses and deaths.",
      "\u201cWe are very concerned for people in Louisiana who have historically depended on vaccination drives to get easily accessible vaccines that are no longer going to be available,\u201d Herricks said.",
      "In liberal New Orleans, the city council passed a resolution Thursday vowing to continue supporting vaccination efforts.",
      "The city's Health Department Director Jennifer Avegno said state-supported efforts have led thousands of people to receive vaccines in the past. However, she anticipates vaccination rates for preventable diseases will drop due to the state's new policy and misinformation promoted by the surgeon general's letter. She pointed out that vaccines are most effective when they are widespread.",
      "\u201cPublic health is really united on this issue: For more than a century, vaccines of all kinds have been a cornerstone of improving public health in America,\u201d Avegno told the city council on Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s not scientific debate on this, this is as close as you can get to established fact that vaccinations, particularly mass vaccinations, and community immunity, saves millions and millions of lives.\u201d",

      "The flower industry points to studies saying that cut flowers pose no health risk to consumers, though some advocates say there hasn't been enough study on whether the contamination could endanger florists who touch them daily.",
      "Paris-based UFC-Que Choisir chose Valentine\u2019s Day to release results of what it said were tests of roses, gerberas and chrysanthemums sold at florists, shops, supermarkets and online. It said it found potentially harmful residues of pesticides in every bouquet.",
      "In the Netherlands \u2014 which produces roughly 60% of the global trade \u2014 a similar study came to similar conclusions.",
      "Unlike for produce that is consumed, regulations in Europe on cut flowers place no limits on the level of pesticides, UFC-Que Choisir notes.",
      "The group is calling on authorities to introduce maximum levels of pesticide residues, a ban on imports of flowers treated with pesticides that are banned in Europe, and mandatory labelling of the origin and treatment of flowers.",
      "The group bought 15 bouquets of flowers. In each one, between seven and up to 46 different pesticide residues were identified, of which an average of almost 12 were deemed hazardous because they are possibly carcinogenic or endocrine disrupting, the group said. Residues of pesticides banned in the EU were found in two-thirds of the bouquets.",
      "Valhor, the French inter-trade organization for horticulture, floristry and landscaping, however pointed to a study in Germany that concluded there were no risks for consumers who buy cut flowers.",

Among those, a study in Belgium showed that pesticides could be absorbed through the skin when handling contaminated flowers, with a potential damaging effect on health.",
      "The Dutch branch of the Pesticide Action Network \u2014 a network of European NGOs promoting sustainable alternatives to pesticides \u2014- tested 13 bouquets of tulips, roses, and mixed bouquets in a certified laboratory. Residues of pesticides were found in all bouquets.",

      "Utah students as early as kindergarten would be required to learn about firearm safety in the classroom under a bill that passed the state House",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah students in as early as kindergarten would be required to learn about firearm safety in the classroom under a bill that passed the state House with overwhelming support Friday.",
      "The Republican-controlled chamber approved the measure in a 59-10 vote and sent it to the Senate, despite concerns from some gun violence prevention advocates that it places an unnecessary burden on children.",
      "Under the proposal, public school students would receive mandatory instruction throughout their K-12 years on how to respond if they encounter a gun. The lessons, which could be presented in a video or by an instructor displaying an actual firearm, would demonstrate best practices for safely handling and storing a gun to prevent accidents.",
      "Elementary age children would learn about gun safety on at least three occasions by the time they reach sixth grade, with the possibility for that instruction to begin in kindergarten, when kids are around five years old.",
      "The bill\u2019s Republican sponsor, Rep. Rex Shipp of Cedar City, said it's aimed at preventing accidental shootings by and of young children. The lessons, he said, will be age-appropriate for each grade level, with younger students learning to avoid touching a gun and alert an adult immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times when they don't have any firearms in their homes or don't do any hunting and shooting, then these kids are not taught what to do when they come in contact with a firearm,\u201d Shipp said.",
      "One other state, Tennessee, has a law on the books requiring firearm safety training in public schools, but it lets education officials determine in which grade they think it's appropriate for students to start receiving that instruction. The lessons, set to begin next school year, will be annual and cannot include live firearms or ammunition.",
      "A Utah statute already allows firearm safety to be taught in schools, but Shipp said teachers don't currently do so. His bill makes it mandatory but allows parents to opt their kids out of the instruction.",
      "If it passes the similarly Republican-led Senate and is signed into law, the lessons would begin next school year.",
      "Gun violence prevention advocates have applauded Utah Republicans for pushing for more gun safety education, but some argue those lessons should be aimed at adults.",
      "The proposal unfairly places the responsibility of gun safety on children rather than their parents, said Barbara Gentry of the Gun Violence Prevention Center of Utah.",
      "\u201cGuns and gun safety are the responsibility of the adult gun owner, not school children,\" Gentry said. \"We support schools sending home materials to parents outlining the importance of safe storage in keeping our families and schools safe from gun violence.\"",
      "Jaden Christensen, a volunteer with the Utah chapter of Moms Demand Action, said lawmakers should instead look to grow programs that teach parents the importance of keeping firearms away from children.",

      "The Canadian government announced Brosseau\u2019s appointment as its fentanyl czar Tuesday.",
      "The move was partly in response to President Donald Trump saying the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants into the U.S. was a reason for threatening to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods \u2013 with an exception of 10% on energy.",
      "Trump has paused the implementation of those tariffs until at least March 4.",
      "\u201cThis is a clear demonstration of how serious Canada is taking the fentanyl crisis in his country and how important our relationship is with our American counterparts,\u201d said Brosseau, who was speaking after touring a Canada Border Services Agency port of entry facility in Lansdowne, Ontario.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping to be able to give an intensity to the work,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mandate is clear, to be able to bring people together to integrate the work and produce results.\u201d",
      "Figures from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) show the agency seized 19.5 kilograms (43 pounds) of fentanyl at the northern border last year. That compares to 9,570 kilograms (21,098 pounds) at the southwestern border.",
      "Brosseau spent more than 20 years in the RCMP, where he served as a deputy commissioner and the senior Mountie in the province of Manitoba. More recently, he was deputy national security and intelligence adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Brosseau said he plans on meeting with Tom Homan, Trump\u2019s border czar, and other U.S. officials soon.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spent a number of years working in law enforcement,\u201d he said. \u201cI know how important those relationships, those collaborations are on the ground. We\u2019re stronger together.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A new study suggests that medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol",
      "Medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol, according to new government-funded research.",
      "The study was small \u2014 just 48 adults \u2014 and lasted just over two months, so it\u2019s not the final word. Experts say it\u2019s not yet clear how safe these drugs are for people who don\u2019t need to lose weight.",
      "But the results add to evidence from animal studies and reports that people are finding drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy helpful to manage cravings, not just for food, but also for tobacco and alcohol. Scientists are studying these drugs in smokers, people with opioid addiction and cocaine users.",
      "\u201cThis is such promising data. And we need more of it,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Klara Klein, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who treats patients with diabetes and obesity. \u201cWe frequently will hear that once people start these medications that their desire to drink is very reduced, if not completely abolished.\"",
      "The drugs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. The new study looked at one of these drugs, semaglutide, which is the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy.",
      "The research, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "There are already three medications approved to treat alcohol use disorder, so until larger studies can confirm the findings, people should talk to their doctor about what's already available, said lead author Christian Hendershot, an addiction researcher at University of Southern California.",
      "For the new study, researchers recruited people who reported symptoms of alcohol use disorder, such as difficulty controlling their drinking, but weren\u2019t actively seeking treatment for it.",
      "First, each person came to a lab where they were served their favorite alcoholic beverage and could drink as much as they wanted over two hours.",
      "Then, researchers randomly assigned half the people to get a weekly injection of semaglutide. The other half got sham injections.",
      "For nine weeks, everyone kept track of their drinking habits and their desire for alcohol. A lab visit with their favorite alcohol was repeated at the end of the study.",
      "During the last weeks of the study, nearly 40% in the semaglutide group reported no heavy drinking days compared with 20% in the placebo group. And in the final lab test, the semaglutide group drank roughly half the amount, on average, compared to those who got the placebo.",
      "Everyone in the study was overweight. It's unclear how safe the drugs would be for a person of normal weight, Klein said.",
      "Smokers in the study who got the semaglutide also cut back on cigarettes, noted Luba Yammine of UTHealth Houston, who is leading other research on GLP-1 drugs for people who want to quit smoking. The finding is promising but more data is needed, Yammine said.",
      "The study \u201cprovides additional important information on the potential role of this new class of medications\u201d in treating certain addictions, said Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, an NIH researcher who is leading a 20-week trial of semaglutide for alcohol use disorder now underway in Baltimore.",
      "\u201cIt is important to keep in mind that we need larger randomized clinical trials to confirm these findings,\u201d Leggio said.",

      "Lawyers for South Carolina and Planned Parenthood are returning to the state\u2019s highest court to argue how restrictive the state's abortion ban should be",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- With a heartbeat abortion ban solidly in place in South Carolina, lawyers for the state and Planned Parenthood return to the state's highest court Wednesday to argue how restrictive the ban should be.",
      "The law is being enforced in South Carolina as a ban on almost all abortions around six weeks after conception, setting that mark as the time cardiac activity starts.",
      "But Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups are arguing the 2023 law includes alternative definitions about the timing of a fetal heart forming and a \u201cheartbeat\u201d starting and the true ban should start around nine or 10 weeks.",
      "Both sides are set to argue for just over an hour at the South Carolina Supreme Court in Columbia. The justices likely will take several months to decide the case. In the meantime, the abortion ban around six weeks likely will remain in place after a lower court upheld it.",
      "The 2023 law says abortions cannot be performed after an ultrasound can detect \u201ccardiac activity, or the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart, within the gestational sac.\u201d",
      "South Carolina and several other states place that at six weeks into development. But what follows the \u201cor\u201d in the sentence could require that a heart has formed, and medical experts say that doesn\u2019t happen until around nine weeks.",
      "The legal fight has been brewing since the state Supreme Court reversed itself after overturning a similar ban in 2021. The Republican-dominated General Assembly then made small changes and a justice who voted in the majority in the 3-2 decision to overturn the ban reached retirement age and was replaced.",
      "In the decision upholding the new ban, the state Supreme Court itself noted the different definitions saying resolving them would be a question \u201cfor another day.\u201d",
      "That day is Wednesday. Since then, more inconsistencies in the law\u2019s language have been brought up. The law refers to a fetal heartbeat, but most experts consider a fertilized egg to be an embryo for about 10 weeks after conception before transitioning into a fetus.",
      "Lawyers for the state said the parsing of the language ignores the intent of the Legislature. Both supporters and opponents of the bill called it nearly exclusively a six-week ban during debate in the House and Senate.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion, most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions and most Democrat-dominated ones have sought to protect abortion access.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and South Carolina and three others have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy -- often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The latest lawsuit was filed by South Carolina resident Taylor Shelton, who said she had sought medical attention for pain from her intrauterine device and was stunned to find out, just two days after missing her regularly-tracked period, that she was pregnant.",
      "She ended up in North Carolina, driving for hours to several appointments to undergo an abortion because doctors in South Carolina were unsure how to define a heartbeat. Shelton couldn\u2019t be completely sure she was within six weeks.",
      "Some Republicans in South Carolina are also pushing for an outright abortion ban, but while legislation was introduced this January when the General Assembly started its two-year session, no hearings have been held."

While serving as health secretary, he has promised to reroute fees collected from the arrangement to his son.",
      "Kennedy is expected to take over the agency in the midst of a massive federal government shakeup, led by billionaire Elon Musk, that has shut off \u2014 even if temporarily \u2014 billions of taxpayer dollars in public health funding and left thousands of federal workers unsure about their jobs.",
      "On Friday, the NIH announced it would cap billions of dollars in medical research given to universities and cancer being used to develop treatments for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.",

      "\u201cIf the support is not resumed, there will be a major disaster and serious harm to vulnerable groups,\u201d said Fares, who heads the organization\u2019s medical programs. \u201cOperating costs of clinics are much lower than those of hospitals.

      "State District Judge Bryan Gantt issued a $100,000 fine against Carpenter and ordered her to pay attorney\u2019s fees.",
      "Earlier Hochul, a Democrat, said she will not honor Louisiana's request to arrest and send the doctor to Louisiana after she was charged with violating the southern state's strict anti-abortion law.",
      "\u201cI will not be signing an extradition order that came from the governor of Louisiana,\u201d Hochul said at a news conference in Manhattan. \u201cNot now, not ever.\u201d",
      "She also said she sent out a notice to law enforcement in New York that instructed them to not cooperate with out-of-state warrants for such charges.",
      "The case against Carpenter appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of prescribing abortion pills to another state.",
      "Pills have become the most common method of abortion in the U.S. and are at the epicenter of political and legal fights over abortion access following the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade.",
      "The showdown between New York and Louisiana over Carpenter is expected to result in a court case that could test New York's so-called shield law, which gives legal protections to doctors who prescribe abortion medication to conservative states where abortions are banned or otherwise limited. Other Democratic-controlled states have similar shield laws.",
      "Prosecutors in West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, indicted Carpenter on charges that she violated the state's near-total abortion ban, which allows physicians convicted of performing abortions, including one with pills, to be sentenced up to 15 years in prison.",
      "Louisiana authorities said the girl who received the pills experienced a medical emergency and had to be transported to the hospital. The girl's mother was also charged and has turned herself in to police.",
      "In a videotaped statement Thursday, Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said \u201cthere is only one right answer in this situation, and it is that that doctor must face extradition to Louisiana where she can stand trial and justice will be served.\u201d",
      "Landry's office did not immediately return an emailed request for comment sent after Hochul refused the extradition request."

      "A generation has passed since the peak in AIDS-related deaths",
      "A generation has passed since the world saw the peak in AIDS-related deaths. Those deaths \u2014 agonizing, from diseases the body might otherwise fight off \u2014 sent loved ones into the streets, pressuring governments to act. The United States eventually did, creating PEPFAR, arguably the most successful foreign aid program in history. HIV, which causes AIDS, is now manageable, though there is still no cure.",
      "Now the Trump administration has put the brakes on foreign aid while alleging it's wasteful, causing chaos in the system that for over 20 years has kept millions of people alive. Confusion over a temporary waiver for PEPFAR \u2014 and the difficulty of restarting its work, with U.S. workers, contractors and payments in upheaval \u2014 means the clock is ticking for many who are suddenly unable to obtain medications to keep AIDS at bay.",
      "The U.S.-led global response to HIV has been so effective that AIDS wards of people wasting away are a vision of the past. Now health experts, patients and others fear those days could return if the Trump administration doesn\u2019t reverse course or no other global power steps into the void, and fast.",
      "\u201cIn the next five years, we could have 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths,\u201d the U.N. AIDS agency told The Associated Press. That's a shock at a time of rising complacency around HIV, declining condom use among some young people and the rise of a medication that some believe could end AIDS for good.",
      "The agency has begun publicly tracking new HIV infections since the aid freeze.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what happens to the body when HIV drugs are stopped:",
      "HIV is spread by bodily fluids such as blood, breast milk or semen. It gradually weakens the body\u2019s immune system and makes it vulnerable to disease, including ones rarely seen in otherwise healthy people. The surprising emergence of such cases in the 1980s is what tipped off health experts to what became known as the AIDS epidemic.",
      "Years of intense advocacy and shocking sights of children, young adults and others dying of pneumonia and other infections led to the response that created PEPFAR, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Twenty million people around the world died before the program was founded. Now millions of people take drugs known as antivirals that keep HIV from spreading in the body.",
      "Stopping those drugs lets the virus start multiplying in the body again, and it could become drug-resistant. HIV can rebound to detectable levels in people\u2019s blood in just a few weeks, putting sexual partners at risk. Babies born to mothers with HIV can escape infection only if the woman was properly treated during pregnancy or the infant is treated immediately after birth.",
      "If the drugs are not taken, a body is heading toward AIDS, the final stage of infection.",
      "\u201cWithout HIV treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about three years,\u201d the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "For a long time, there may be no noticeable symptoms. But a person can easily spread HIV to others, and the immune system becomes vulnerable to what are called opportunistic diseases.",
      "The National Institutes of Health says opportunistic diseases include fungal infections, pneumonia, salmonella and tuberculosis. For a country like South Africa, with the world\u2019s highest number of HIV cases and one of the largest numbers of TB cases, the toll could be immense.",
      "Unchecked by HIV treatment, the damage continues. The immune system is increasingly unable to fight off diseases. Every action, from eating to travel, must consider the potential exposure to germs.",
      "For years, the importance of taking the drugs every day, even at the same time of day, has been emphasized to people with HIV. Now the ability to follow that essential rule has been shaken.",
      "Already, hundreds or thousands of U.S.-funded health partners in countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia have been laid off, causing widespread gaps in HIV testing, messaging, care and support on the continent most helped by PEPFAR. At some African clinics, people with HIV have been turned away.",
      "Restoring the effects caused by the Trump administration's foreign aid freeze during a 90-day review period, and understanding what\u2019s allowed under the waiver for PEPFAR, will take time that health experts say many people don't have.",
      "Meanwhile, the head of the U.N. AIDS agency, Winnie Byanyima, told the AP that more resistant strains of the disease could emerge.",
      "And an additional 3.4 million children could be made orphans \u2014 another echo of the time when the world raced to confront AIDS with few tools at hand.",

      "Lawyers for 25,000 people incarcerated in Arizona have asked a judge to take over health care operations in state-run prisons and appoint an official to run them",
      "PHOENIX -- Lawyers for 25,000 people incarcerated in Arizona have asked a judge to take over health care operations in state-run prisons and appoint an official to run them, saying the state is not capable of fixing deep failures in care even though it has been required to do so over the last decade.",
      "In a filing Tuesday, the attorneys said a takeover is urgently needed because the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry lacks the leadership to comply with changes ordered by a judge in a 2012 lawsuit over the quality of medical and mental health care for prisoners.",
      "The first constitutional violation in the case was found in 2015, they said, and \u201cA decade later, defendants still have not demonstrated the will, knowledge, or capacity to reform their prison healthcare system.\u201d",
      "Arizona settled the case in 2014 but for years was dogged by complaints that it failed to follow through on its promises. The court slapped the state with contempt fines of $1.4 million in 2018 and $1.1 million in 2021. The settlement was eventually thrown out due to Arizona\u2019s noncompliance, and a trial was ordered.",
      "In a blistering 2022 verdict, U.S. District Court Judge Roslyn Silver ruled that the state was violating prisoners\u2019 constitutional rights by providing them with inadequate care, knew about the problem for years and refused to correct it.",
      "She also said prison health care deficiencies resulted in preventable deaths and issued an injunction requiring corrections authorities to fix the constitutional violations.",
      "In September 2019 lawyers representing the prisoners made a similar request for a takeover, also known as a receivership. Though Silver has previously shied away from granting that, she later said she would revive that possibility if the state acts in bad faith or fails to comply with the court-ordered changes.",
      "Lawyers for prisoners pointed to a recent report from a court-appointed expert who said health care for prisoners \u201cremains poor, has shown little improvement since the start of the Injunction, and continues to place the residents at significant risk of serious harm, including death.\u201d",
      "The corrections department and Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs' office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the request.",
      "Past receiverships have been ordered for prisons in other states. In California in 2005, a federal judge seized control of the prison medical system after finding that an average of one inmate a week was dying of medical neglect or malpractice.",
      "The Arizona lawsuit does not cover the nearly 10,000 people incarcerated in private prisons for state convictions."

      "Nearly 200 nations faced a Monday deadline to file what the United Nations' climate chief calls \u201camong the most important policy documents governments will produce this century\u201d \u2014 their plans on how they will cut emissions of heat-trapping gases.",
      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",
      "The deadline \u2014 set in the Paris agreement to be nine months before the next international climate negotiations, this year in Belem, Brazil \u2014 is 11:59 p.m. in Germany, where the U.N. climate office is.",
      "But Stiell said the real deadline is in September. That's when the United Nations will tally up all the plans and figure out how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented if countries do what they promise.",
      "That's a big if.",
      "The European Union and China should be done by the middle of the year and India will only submit their target after other major emitting nations do so, Hohne said.",

      "It's too early in some legislative sessions to know whether the measures will get serious consideration. But it does show that the policy debate continues to evolve following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans on abortion.",
      "Here's a look at where things stand:",
      "Lawmakers in several states have introduced measures to classify the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 which are used together in the majority of U.S. abortions \u2014 as controlled dangerous substances, making it a crime to possess them without prescriptions.",

New York officials say they will not extradite the doctor to Louisiana.",

      "Some advocates are calling on President Donald Trump to enforce an 1873 law to ban mailing medication or instruments used in abortion, but he has not done so.",
      "While critics say the drugs are unsafe, some major medical groups disagree. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is decades of evidence that mifepristone and misoprostol are safe and effective. The group cited a study showing that major adverse events such as significant infection and excessive blood loss occur in less than 0.32% of patients taking mifepristone for a medication abortion. Medical organizations say mifepristone\u2019s safety compares to that of the over-the-counter pain medication ibuprofen.",

      "In 2022, Sweden became the first country to introduce body checking to its premier women\u2019s league, bringing its rule book closer to men\u2019s hockey even though hockey\u2019s world governing body does not formally allow the practice because of safety concerns. It has opened up a new world for women's players, who say they feel more empowered playing the game the way it was intended.",
      "Swedish hockey officials say the results have been overwhelmingly positive: The women\u2019s game has become faster and more entertaining while concussions, which have been a scourge for the sport, have decreased.",
      "Other countries are now looking to follow suit, with the PWHL \u2014 the professional women\u2019s league in North America with some of the world's top players \u2014 putting checking in the rules for its inaugural season last year.",
      "\u201cIt has given us the opportunity to prove we\u2019re physical, we\u2019re strong and we can play just like the men\u2019s players,\u201d Bellefontaine said. \u201cIt allows us to show we can \u2014 and we will.\u201d",
      "Bellefontaine joined MoDo for the start of the 2023-24 season. It\u2019s a title-contending team from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, a sleepy coastal town some 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of Stockholm \u2014 and not far from the Arctic Circle \u2014 whose population of 30,000 lives and breathes hockey and whose most famous alumni include NHL greats Peter Forsberg, Henrik and Daniel Sedin, and Markus Naslund.",
      "Initially it was something of a culture shock to her.",
      "\u201cI had no prior experience of hitting at all,\u201d the 25-year-old Bellefontaine said, \u201cand we went right into the season so it took me a while to get into it \u2026 it was tough but now it\u2019s just fun.\u201d",
      "Safer, too.",
      "Statistics supplied by the Swedish women\u2019s league show the number of concussions sustained by players has dropped since 2018, when its \u201cProject Zero Vision\u201d was launched. There were 35 reported concussions in the 2018-19 regular season, 10 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24. By Jan. 8 this year, which was approaching the end of the regular season, there had been six.",
      "Preventing concussions was the main driver behind the introduction of checking, as counterintuitive as that may seem. It has forced players to skate with their heads up, increasing their ice awareness.",
      "There have been other benefits of bringing back checking, which was part of the game in women\u2019s hockey in Europe and North America until the mid-1980s but isn\u2019t in the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s current rule book. Coaches, league officials and fans say the speed of the Swedish game has gotten quicker, as players make smarter and faster decisions.",
      "For many, it restores the balance between skill and physicality that is important in making the sport an entertaining watch.",
      "\u201cIt creates some tension in the game that you otherwise don\u2019t get,\u201d said Luc de Keijzer, a 27-year-old student who is a regular at MoDo games.",
      "One big hope is that increased physical play makes Sweden more competitive at the international level against traditional hockey powers like the United States, Canada and Finland. Sweden's women's team regularly goes deep in world championships and Olympic Games but hasn't won the gold medal at either tournament.",
      "For some female players, the biggest effect has been to make them feel more empowered. That\u2019s because they are essentially following the same rules as the men, except for one key difference: hits on open ice \u2014 when players are skating freely away from the boards \u2014 are forbidden in women\u2019s hockey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to close the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey, so this is one way we are doing it \u2014 to have similar rules as they do,\u201d said Alexie Guay, another Canadian playing for MoDo. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intense and there are different rules still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there will be fighting in women\u2019s hockey in the future \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely closing the gap and I think it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",
      "According to research by Lund University in Sweden, 88% of the 159 players from the league who responded to a questionnaire said they were in favor of checking.",
      "Jared Cipparone, the coach of MoDo\u2019s women\u2019s team, said he hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance from his players about checking.",
      "\u201cEveryone was excited about it,\u201d said Cipparone, who is also from Canada. \u201cThe first year was trial and fire for many, but last year and this year you see the significance it\u2019s made in the game and I\u2019ve only heard good things about it.\u201d",
      "At MoDo\u2019s home game against HV71 at Hagglunds Arena in early January, a MoDo player was almost knocked off her skates by a full-body hit. Many others were smashed into the boards but went on with the game. There were no roughing penalties and certainly no brawling.",
      "The 5-foot-7 Bellefontaine, who describes herself as \u201cpretty small,\u201d has had to adapt her game. She said she trains harder, watches what she eats to \u201cbulk up a little bit\u201d and is making use of the sauna in her apartment for post-match recovery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely squeezing my core a little more,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t even expect to be hit so now it\u2019s head on a swivel, always looking, always watching, and just being ready to take a hit. You have to make sure you\u2019re not in a position to jeopardize yourself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed the way we play and made us better players.\u201d",
      "USA Hockey and Hockey Canada do not allow checking in girls and women's hockey. In Sweden, body checking is part of the rules for boys and girls starting at the age of 12. League officials say being educated so early prepares players for when they are older.",
      "MoDo fan Marie Johansson said her 18-year-old daughter, Amanda, started with checking from age 12, initially while playing with boys.",
      "\u201cAll parents are worried about their children getting injured,\u201d Johansson said, \u201cbut when they learn to do the checking, they train a lot, they learn how to hold their heads up high, and she learnt how to avoid injuries. I don\u2019t think because she\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve been more worried than if she\u2019d been a boy.\u201d",
      "Morgan Johansson, an official who helped to launch the Zero Vision project, said he has shared information with the IIHF and the PWHL about the effects the rule change has had on the Swedish league. Norwegian and Danish leagues have also contacted him.",
      "Last year, the IIHF had PWHL officials in North America outline the league\u2019s rules on checking and officiating in a potential first step to modify its rulebook and provide a new standard at international competitions, league vice president of hockey operations Jayna Hefford said.",
      "Contacted by the AP, the IIHF said its rulebook \u201cdoes not prohibit competitive body contact between players\u201d but noted its staff was working with its membership \"to clarify the interpretation of this part in women\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "As for the Swedes, they are happy to have made the bold step that others are starting to follow.",
      "\u201cWe are kind of a trailblazer when it comes to women\u2019s hockey in challenging the old structures that said, \u2018Women can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Angelica Lindeberg, operations manager for the Swedish league. \u201cNow we say, of course they can. We are very proud of that.\u201d",

      "ZAGREB, Croatia -- Thirteen people suspected of illegally importing and disposing of hazardous waste have been arrested in Croatia, the European Union\u2019s law enforcement agency said Friday.",
      "The main suspects, two Croatian nationals, are considered high-value targets by Europol, said an agency statement. They are believed to have orchestrated the illegal hazardous waste imports from Italy, Slovenia and Germany to Croatia.",
      "Rather than being properly treated, the waste was simply dumped and buried, Europol said. The statement added that at least 35,000 tons (38,580 U.S. tons) of waste were illegally disposed of resulting in a profit of at least 4 million euros ($4.2 million).",
      "The waste was declared as recyclable plastic waste but was \u201clegally considered dangerous waste,\u201d Europol said. Croatian authorities believe the criminal network also illegally buried and dumped medical waste from Croatian companies, it said.",
      "Croatian anti-corruption authorities said in a statement of their own Friday that they have launched an investigation into 10 people and four legal entities suspected of criminal conspiracy, crimes against the environment, tax evasion and money laundering. They said they will seek to keep seven people detained, the state-run HRT television said.",

      "Thousands of supporters have gathered in downtown Beirut to mark the 20th anniversary of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri\u2019s assassination",
      "BEIRUT -- Thousands of supporters gathered in downtown Beirut on Friday to commemorate the 20th anniversary of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri\u2019s assassination, which comes amid seismic regional political shifts.",
      "The ousting of Bashar Assad in December after 54 years of family rule in Syria marked the fall of a government long accused of orchestrating Hariri\u2019s assassination and other political killings in Lebanon.",
      "Meanwhile, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah \u2014 whose members were convicted by a U.N.-backed tribunal for their role in Hariri\u2019s murder \u2014 now faces its own turning point following the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an Israeli airstrike in September. Nasrallah\u2019s funeral is set for February 23.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning of justice. If the justice of the earth did not serve us, no one escapes the justice of heaven,\" said Hariri\u2019s son, former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, as he addressed a huge crowd in the capital Beirut.",
      "\"After 20 years, Rafik Hariri\u2019s project is continuing, and those who tried to kill the project, look where they are now,\" Saad added.",
      "Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, appointed in early February, visited Hariri\u2019s burial site earlier Friday.",
      "\u201cToday, we remember the legacy of the great martyr in serving Lebanon, preserving its national unity, and working for its prosperity,\u201d Salam wrote on X. \u201cHe was greatly respected in the Arab world and the world, leaving Lebanon with a remarkable moral and political legacy.\u201d",
      "Lebanon\u2019s president Joseph Aoun also paid tribute to Hariri, saying on X that Hariri's \"national stances were a fundamental building block in strengthening national unity and protecting civil peace.\u201d",
      "Hariri was killed on Feb. 14, 2005, when a massive bomb exploded near the St. Georges Hotel, a historic landmark on Beirut\u2019s waterfront. The blast killed 21 other people and injured over 200.",
      "In 2020, a U.N.-backed tribunal convicted one member of the Hezbollah militant group and acquitted three others of involvement in the assassination. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon said Salim Ayyash was guilty as a co-conspirator of five charges linked to his involvement in the suicide truck bombing.",
      "None of the suspects was ever arrested or attended court to hear the verdicts.",
      "The assassination of Hariri ignited the \u201cCedar Revolution,\u201d leading to massive protests against Syria\u2019s nearly three-decade military presence in Lebanon, ultimately culminating in the withdrawal of Syrian troops in 2005. The assassination also intensified sectarian divisions within Lebanon and bolstered the political influence of Assad's ally, Hezbollah.",
      "Buses from across Lebanon arrived early, bringing supporters to downtown Beirut to commemorate the anniversary. Thousands of people filled the streets and waved Lebanese flags and the blue flag of Hariri's Future Movement to songs honoring Hariri's memory.",
      "\u201cAfter the Syrian and Iranian guardianship ended and the ousting of the Syrian regime, the Lebanese state alone rules us,\u201d Mohammad Kanaan told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIn this square, you expelled Bashar Assad from Lebanon,\u201d Saad said during his speech. \u201cAnd after twenty years of sectarian rule, detention and brutality, the heroic Syrian people rose up and expelled the criminal from Syria.\u201d",
      "Another supporter, Ahmad Serhal, said he hoped that \u201cLebanon would unite\u201d after the departure of Assad. \u201cAll the political shifts are for the good of this country. Lebanon is for all the Lebanese, we need to reach an agreement and unite.\u201d",
      "\u201cGod took revenge upon those who assassinated president Rafik \u2014 from ousting Assad, from ousting the system that is allied with Iran,\u201d Ahmad Trab said. \u201cWe hope for a better future now with Syria.\u201d",
      "The anniversary of Hariri\u2019s death comes just four days before the deadline for Israeli troops to withdraw from southern Lebanon under a ceasefire agreement that ended a 14-month war with Hezbollah in late November. The ceasefire deal also stipulates that Hezbollah must end its military presence south of the Litani River, with the Lebanese Army and UN peacekeepers deploying in the vacated areas.",
      "The pullout deadline, initially set for Jan. 26, was postponed to Feb. 18.",
      "Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said Lebanon \u201cabsolutely rejects\u201d an Israeli proposal to keep troops in five strategic border points after the withdrawal. \u201cIt is the responsibility of the Americans to impose (the withdrawal), otherwise they will have caused the biggest setback for the government,\u201d he said.",
      "Aoun has also insisted that Israel must adhere to the agreed-upon timeline. During his speech, Saad also emphasized the need for the Israeli army's withdrawal from Lebanon.",
      "Saad addressed the people of southern and eastern Lebanon, regions largely supporters of and influenced by Hezbollah, urging them to seize Lebanon\u2019s golden opportunity while dispelling any perception of being \u201ca force of obstruction.\u201d",
      "On Feb. 8, Lebanon formed a new government led by Salam, the first fully empowered administration since 2022. Salam, a former president of the International Court of Justice, was appointed following the election of Aoun in January. The 24-member cabinet includes a mix of technocrats and political figures, representing various sects, including Hezbollah\u2019s allies.",
      "Although Hezbollah did not formally endorse Salam\u2019s appointment, the group negotiated during the government formation process.",
      "The United States has expressed support for the new government, emphasizing the importance of stability and reforms, though opposing Hezbollah\u2019s direct participation in the cabinet. Salam's government now faces Lebanon\u2019s longstanding economic crisis and an urgent need to implement key financial reforms.",
      "The political shift has reopened the door for renewed Arab engagement, particularly from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which had previously distanced themselves from Lebanon due to the growing influence of Iran and its ally, Hezbollah.",
      "These countries, which had strong ties with Lebanon under Hariri, are now reassessing their approach, with hopes of reintegrating Lebanon into the Arab fold."

      "SRINAGAR, India -- There was guarded optimism among military experts in India as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump outlined plans to ramp up sales of defense systems to New Delhi, including F-35 stealth fighter jets, to deepen the U.S.-India strategic relationship.",
      "\u201cDefense sector is a big money, and India happens to be one of the top buyers in the world,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Vinod Bhatia, India\u2019s director-general for military operations from 2012 to 2014. \u201cAs long as we buy, Trump will be happy but it\u2019s surely going to expand our conventional deterrence.\u201d",
      "The meeting signaled that \u201cdefense diplomacy is the core of diplomacy these days,\" Bhatia said.",
      "In a joint statement at the White House, the two leaders announced plans to sign a new 10-year framework later this year for the U.S.-India Major Defense Partnership.",
      "Modi and Trump \u201cpledged to elevate military cooperation across all domains \u2014 air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace \u2014 through enhanced training, exercises, and operations, incorporating the latest technologies,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The leaders also \u201ccommitted to break new ground to support and sustain the overseas deployments of the U.S. and Indian militaries in the Indo-Pacific, including enhanced logistics and intelligence sharing,\" the statement said.",
      "While Indian military experts have long sought to diversify national defense procurements, analysts say it will take years to reduce New Delhi\u2019s dependency on Russian arms, even with expanded defense cooperation with the U.S.",
      "Raja Mohan, an analyst at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore, said expansion in defense cooperation would take time.",
      "\u201cWhat India wants is coproduction and more research and development in India. It\u2019s a long-term project,\u201d he said.",
      "It is difficult for India to remain dependent on Russia for defense equipment owing to difficulties obtaining parts and upgrades. However, a deal with the U.S. for F-35 stealth fighter jets will not fill India's immediate need for more than 100 aircraft, said Rahul Bedi, an independent defense analyst based in India.",
      "\u201cThey are not going to come tomorrow,\u201d Bedi said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take several years to start arriving,\u201d he added.",
      "As its geostrategic competition with China has grown manifold in recent years, India has diversified defense acquisitions from the U.S., Israel and France while seeking to move toward self-reliance in this sector. But New Delhi is still far from getting over its dependence on supplies and spare parts from Russia that makes up to 60% of Indian defense equipment.",
      "With vast borders and protracted border conflicts with neighboring countries Pakistan and China, India also relies hugely on Moscow for military upgrades and modernization.",
      "\u201cIndia faces threats from China and Pakistan, and a threat from collaborative Pakistan-China. We need technologically capable systems to counter these threats and one country that can give such systems is America,\u201d said Lt. Gen. D.S. Hooda, who from 2014 to 2016 headed the Indian military\u2019s Northern Command.",
      "China\u2019s rise as a global power also has pushed India closer to the U.S. and to the Quad, a new Indo-Pacific strategic alliance among the U.S., India, Australia and Japan.",
      "The growing strategic alliance accuses China of economic coercion and military maneuvering in the region, upsetting the status quo, and has ruffled feathers in Beijing, which sees the relationship as a counterweight against China\u2019s rise.",
      "Indian fears of Chinese territorial expansion are bolstered by the growing presence of the Chinese navy in the Indian Ocean and Beijing\u2019s efforts to strengthen ties with not only Pakistan but also Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.",
      "\u201cThe major threat is from China which is outstripping India\u2019s capability,\u201d Hooda said.",
      "In the early 1990s, about 70% of Indian army weapons, 80% of its air force systems and 85% of its navy platforms were of Soviet origin. From 2016 to 2020, Russia accounted for nearly 49% of India\u2019s defense imports while French and Israeli shares were 18% and 13%, respectively, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.",
      "Major Indian purchases from the U.S. included long-range maritime patrol aircraft, C-130 transport aircraft, missiles and drones.",
      "The defense sales also can potentially offset the trade deficit between the two countries, Hooda said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for all. America will get more business, and we\u2019ll get modern weapons,\u201d Hooda said. \u201cIt will also help to ease pressure on the tariff issue and trade deficit.\u201d",

      "Trump called Modi a \u201cmuch better negotiator than me,\u201d while Modi played on Trump's \u201cMAGA,\u201d or \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d catchphrase, saying he he was determined to \u201cMake India Great Again.\u201d",
      "Here are some key takeaways from the meeting:",
      "Trade and tariffs issues figured extensively in the meeting. Trump said New Delhi will not be spared and said the import levies imposed by India are \u201cvery unfair and strong.\u201d",
      "But he and Modi agreed to work on a deal to resolve trade concerns, which Modi said he expects to be completed later this year.",
      "Trump also said that his administration wants to bring down the trade deficit with India \u2014 which stands at $50 billion \u2014 by increasing U.S. energy exports to the country.",
      "Modi offered to double bilateral trade with Washington to $500 billion by 2030.",
      "\u201cThe fact is that Trump is trying to change the global trading order. India recognizes this and now is looking for a pragmatic way to resolve the differences,\u201d said Raja Mohan, an analyst at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore.",
      "Trump said the U.S. will increase its military sales to India and eventually provide F-35 stealth fighter jets. He did not provide a timeline, but Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters that the process is \u201cat the stage of a proposal.\u201d",
      "Rahul Bedi, an India-based defense analyst, said such a deal could \u201ctake several years.\u201d",
      "Since 2008, India has contracted for over $20 billion worth of U.S.-origin defense equipment, and a recent deal will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with an Indian company to produce jet engines in India.",
      "Modi and Trump also agreed to deepen security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, a thinly veiled reference to competition with growing China in the region.",
      "Trump said he\u2019d back extraditing one of the plotters of the 2008 Mumbai attacks in which 166 people were killed appearing to refer to Tahawwur Hussain Rana.",
      "Indian officials have accused Pakistan\u2019s intelligence agency of working with Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taibah to mastermind the attack, an allegation Islamabad has denied.",
      "If Rana is extradited to India, it will boost Modi's domestic standing. He's positioned himself as tough on archrival Pakistan.",
      "Modi and Trump also said they discussed immigration, with the Indian prime minister saying India will take back any of its citizens living illegally in the U.S.",
      "India recently accepted the return of 104 migrants brought back on a U.S. military plane.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Australian and Philippine authorities took steps on Valentine\u2019s Day to help would-be victims avoid hurting their \u201chearts and bank accounts\u201d in online love scams.",
      "The Australian Federal Police, with the help of Filipino authorities, on Friday publicized online dialogues used by an online love scam syndicate, which had been dismantled in the Philippines, to help foster vigilance.",
      "\u201cThe Australian Federal Police is flipping the script on romance scammers this Valentine\u2019s Day by revealing real-life dialogue used to target the bank accounts \u2014 and hearts \u2014 of thousands of potential victims online,\u201d a joint statement by the Australian police, the Philippine Anti-Organized Crime Commission and other law enforcement agencies said.",
      "Philippine authorities raided the syndicate\u2019s hideout near Manila in October, arrested more than 250 mostly Chinese suspected members and seized computers and other gadgets used in the online fraud.",
      "After an investigation, Australian and Philippine police found the syndicate had attempted to victimize about 5,000 people in Australia alone. They were trying to check if those Australians have already been defrauded, Australian Federal Police officer Kathleen Oehlers said in a news conference in Manila with Philippine anti-crime officials.",
      "About $15 million have been lost to such online love scams from victims in Australia last year alone, according to Oehlers.",
      "Under the scheme, the suspects would hunt for potential victims, mostly fully employed males, in online dating apps and then use romantic dialogues to develop a whirlwind romance online. A victim would later be encouraged by a scammer under cover of a fake picture and identity to invest in cryptocurrency, initially with relatively small amounts, before shifting the funds to the syndicate\u2019s account, Oehlers said.",
      "Philippine Undersecretary Gilbert Cruz, who heads the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission, said that aside from publicizing the dialogues used by the syndicate to lure and defraud victims, the Australian police also provided crucial tips online. They included being wary of red flags like \u201coverly affectionate behavior,\u201d he said.",
      "Philippine authorities would take similar steps to foster vigilance, Cruz said.",
      "\"The scammer would portray a kind-hearted Filipino woman living in Australia or a local female resident in the Philippines, heartbroken by an ex-fiance who wanted my money, not my love,\u2019\u201d the statement said.",
      "\"I\u2019m sorry if our first day of chat is very emotional. By the way, how\u2019s your business?\u201d according to one of the scripts used by the syndicate to shift the topic to cryptocurrency investment.",
      "Last year, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered the closure of the mostly Chinese-run online gaming operations up to the end of 2024, accusing them of venturing into crimes, including financial scams, human trafficking, torture, kidnappings and murder.",
      "The Chinese-run online gambling outfits were estimated to number more than 400 across the Philippines and employ hundreds of thousands of Chinese and Southeast Asian nationals.",
      "The ban forced many remaining syndicates to break into smaller outfits in the Philippines and diversify their operations into an array of online love, cryptocurrency and investment scams, the Philippine anti-organized crime commission said."

      "A man from Memphis, Tennessee, has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife during their honeymoon in Fiji in 2022",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- A man from Memphis, Tennessee, was sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife during their honeymoon in Fiji in 2022, a court official said on Friday.",
      "Bradley Robert Dawson, 40, will have to serve at least 18 years in prison before he can be considered for release, a Fiji High Court registry official in Lautoka said.",
      "Dawson was convicted in December of murdering his wife, Christe Chen, who was then 36, at the exclusive Turtle Island resort in the Yasawa archipelago two days after the newlyweds arrived in the South Pacific nation. He then fled by kayak to a nearby island.",
      "He was sentenced by Justice Riyaz Hamza on Wednesday.",
      "Hamza told Dawson he had shown disregard for Chen\u2019s right to life and her personal liberty.",
      "\u201cYour conduct after the incident was appalling. Having inflicted serious and life-threatening injuries to the deceased you fled the scene of the crime, leaving the deceased alone and helpless,\u201d Hamza said, according to The Fiji Times newspaper.",
      "Chen's body was discovered in the couple\u2019s room by resort staff with multiple blunt trauma wounds to her head after the couple was heard arguing and did not appear at breakfast or lunch the next day.",
      "Dawson pleaded not guilty to the charge and was tried over eight days.",
      "His lawyer Anil Prasad told the court that prosecutors had failed provide sufficient evidence to convict Dawson, the Fijian Broadcasting Corp. reported.",
      "Prasad said that while the prosecution alleged that Dawson was planning to flee Fiji, authorities failed to acknowledge that many of the couple\u2019s personal belongings remained at the resort.",
      "Prasad also said Dawson had no injuries to suggest he had been involved in a physical altercation with his wife.",
      "But the judge said he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Dawson and no one else had committed the crime.",
      "Under Fijian law, prisoners can apply for parole after serving a minimum term set by a court, although the parole board is currently unstaffed. Critics argue the lack of an effective parole option is a cause of prison overcrowding.",
      "David Naylor, an Australian National University expert on Pacific law and regulation who has lectured in Fiji, said that after serving 18 years in prison, Dawson could apply to the national Mercy Commission to be released with a pardon from the Fijian president.",
      "He could also apply for his life sentence to be reduced to a fixed term, which would set a release date, Naylor said.",
      "Dawson worked in the information technology department at Youth Villages, a nonprofit child welfare and support organization based in Memphis. An online records search showed no criminal arrests for Dawson in Shelby County, which includes Memphis.",
      "The Turtle Island resort, where the pair stayed, is an exclusive and remote 500-acre island that accommodates only 14 couples at a time. Yasawa is a group of about 20 volcanic islands in the west of Fiji, a nation of 930,000 people."

    "story": [
      "This Valentine's Day Kenya's flower industry is being ravaged by pests, leading some flower farmers to rely more heavily on toxic pesticides",
      "ISINYA, Kenya -- The red rose: a token of love for many, and for Kenya, a major economic sector. More than a third of Kenya's flower exports where the roses, in particular, are prized for their longevity and vase performance, the Kenyan government says.",
      "What can\u2019t be seen within these uniformly perfect blooms is a tiny larva laid inside the rosebuds, laid by the false codling moth (Thaumatotibia leucotreta), which doesn\u2019t just feed on roses but can also affect fruits and vegetables.",
      "The moth has been devastating crops across Africa. The European Union is intensifying measures to prevent its spread into Europe, classifying FCM among organisms targeted for regulation as quarantine pests, with consequences for hard-pressed Kenyan farmers.",
      "According to the Kenya Flower Council, the detection of a single live FCM at any developmental stage leads to the rejection of an entire flower consignment.",
      "\u201cThey are too strict,\u201d laments Jacky Mwanzia, a marketer with Isinya Roses in Kajiado County, south of Nairobi. \u201cMost of our shipments to the EU are quarantined, and it takes time. It is a waste because we have to meet customers\u2019 demand, so we are looking for alternative markets where these measures are not too strict, as we lose about 30% of our revenue.\u201d",
      "Nationally, the flower industry employs half a million people, according to a Central Bank of Kenya 2021 report, and is estimated by the National Bureau of Statistics to be worth over $800 million. Roses make up about 66% of cut flower exports, at an estimated value of about $300 million.",
      "The Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS) reports that since 2020, EU sampling of Kenyan roses has increased from 5% to 25%, leading to more frequent quarantines and shipment returns.",
      "Despite existing stringent protocols, the EU is expected to enforce even tougher restrictions in the coming months. Due to ongoing noncompliance by exporters, the EU will impose special requirements applicable to Kenyan cut roses, reports the Committee Linking Entrepreneurship, Agriculture, and Development, a French-based network of companies that engages in sustainable agriculture. These new rules take effect on Apr. 26, 2025.",
      "Kenya\u2019s warm climate and soils are ideal for growing roses but also favor pests, so pesticides are routinely used to minimize losses. A 2020 study by the Route To Food Initiative of the Nairobi branch of the Heinrich Boell Foundation, a non-profit, found that 75% of pesticides used in Kenya are highly hazardous. Nearly half are banned in the EU but are still used in Kenya largely due to lower regulatory standards.",
      "Farmers who want to export to the EU have to stay within the bloc's pesticide regulations while also trying to control FCM populations. It can be a tricky balancing act.",
      "\u201cThe EU has a strict zero tolerance on caterpillars and on several chemicals that, given the current weather conditions, we must use. Otherwise, we cannot meet our production targets,\u201d says Anantha Kumar, marketing manager at Isinya Roses. The company is a major local employer, with a workforce of up to 1,000 people, depending on seasonal demand.",
      "As a result, the company is now eyeing other markets with less stringent regulations. \u201cThe Middle East market is ready to accept our products, and it is really growing,\u201d Kumar says.",
      "In spite of the challenges, the growers at Isinya Roses are not ready to abandon the European market just yet. They are trying natural pest control methods, including releasing beneficial insects, companion planting, using pheromone traps, and applying natural fertilizers and composting instead of chemical fertilizers.",
      "But this year, flower farmers will likely face a challenging Valentine\u2019s Day and Mother\u2019s Day, which are usually peak sales periods for cut flowers around the world.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial proposal to remove more than 2 million Palestinians from Gaza and settle them elsewhere in the region has cast even more doubt on the future of the ceasefire.",
      "But Hamas said Thursday it would move ahead with the release of more hostages after talks with Egyptian and Qatari officials. The group said the mediators had pledged to \u201cremove all hurdles\u201d to assure Israel would allow more tents, medical supplies and other essentials into Gaza.",
      "The three hostages set to be released after more than 16 months in captivity are: Iair Horn, 46, a dual citizen of Israel and Argentina; Sagui Dekel Chen, 36, who is American-Israeli; and Alexander (Sasha) Troufanov, 29, who holds Israeli and Russian citizenship.",

      "Israel sentenced Ahmed Barghouti to life on charges that he dispatched suicide bombers during the Second Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in the early 2000s to carry out attacks that killed Israeli civilians. He was arrested alongside Marwan Barghouti in 2002.",
      "Of the 251 people abducted, 73 remain in Gaza, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Nearly all the remaining hostages are men, including Israeli soldiers.",
      "Concern has been growing about the remaining hostages\u2019 condition, particularly after the release of three last Saturday, who emerged looking emaciated and frail.",
      "One of them, 65-year-old Keith Siegel, said Friday in a video message addressed to Trump that his captors treated him worse as the 15-month war intensified, kicking him, spitting on him and holding him without water or light.",
      "The ceasefire appeared dangerously close to collapse in recent days.",
      "Hamas had said it would delay the release of the hostages after accusing Israel of not adhering to their agreement by not allowing in enough shelters, medical supplies, fuel and heavy equipment for clearing rubble. Israel said it would resume fighting Saturday unless hostages were freed.",
      "While the immediate crisis may have been averted, the truce faces a much bigger challenge with the deal\u2019s first phase set to conclude in early March. There have not yet been substantive negotiations over the second phase, in which Hamas would release all remaining hostages in return for an end to the war.",
      "At its height, the fighting displaced 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million. Hundreds of thousands have since returned to their homes as the ceasefire took hold, though many found only rubble, buried human remains and unexploded ordnance.",
      "The war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposal to remove some 2 million Palestinians from Gaza and settle them elsewhere in the region has thrown the truce\u2019s future into further doubt.",

      "Trump\u2019s undetailed musings have left Europeans in a quandary, wondering how \u2014 or even if \u2014 they can maintain the post-WWII security that NATO afforded them or fill the gap in the billions of dollars of security assistance that the Biden administration provided to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion.",
      "Trump has been highly skeptical of that aid and is expected to cut or otherwise limit it as negotiations get underway in the coming days.",
      "\u201cThere can be no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine. And Ukraine\u2019s voice must be at the heart of any talks,\u201d U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey told reporters at NATO headquarters as the alliance\u2019s 32 defense ministers met for talks on the war-torn country.",
      "Trump was noncommittal on Wednesday about whether Ukraine would have a seat at the table in U.S. negotiations with Russia. But asked by reporters Thursday, Trump said, \u201cOf course they would. I mean, they\u2019re part of it. We would have Ukraine, we have Russia and we\u2019ll have other people involved, too.\u201d",
      "He also noted that representatives from Russia would be at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "Both Trump and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth dashed Ukraine\u2019s hopes this week of becoming part of NATO, which the alliance said less than a year ago was \u201cirreversible,\u201d or getting back its territory captured by Russia, which currently occupies close to 20% including Crimea.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see any way that a country in Russia\u2019s position could allow ... them to join NATO,\u201d Trump said Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening.\u201d",
      "Asked what he thought Russia should give up to reach a deal, he noted that talks have not yet begun and that \u201cmaybe Russia will give up a lot, maybe they won\u2019t.\u201d",
      "At NATO headquarters, Hegseth reiterated Thursday that \u201csimply pointing out realism like the borders won\u2019t be rolled back to what everybody would like them to be in 2014 is not a concession to Vladimir Putin.\u201d He said it\u2019s a recognition of realities on the ground.",
      "He added, though, that neither Russia nor Ukraine will \u201cget everything that they want\u201d and stressed that \u201cany negotiation that\u2019s had will be had with both.\u201d",
      "Rubio also told Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha in a call before leaving for Munich that the U.S. was committed to Ukrainian independence. He reiterated \u201cthe need for bold diplomacy to end the war in a negotiated manner leading to a sustainable peace,\u201d according to a State Department readout.",
      "Vance, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, said that the U.S. would hit Moscow with sanctions and potentially military action if Putin won\u2019t agree to a peace deal with Ukraine that guarantees Kyiv\u2019s long-term independence.",
      "The warning that military options \u201cremain on the table\u201d was striking language from a Trump administration that\u2019s repeatedly underscored a desire to quickly end the war.",
      "\u201cThere are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,\u201d Vance added.",
      "The U.S. reassurances may have somewhat allayed Zelenskyy\u2019s fears, although they will not replace any lost military or economic support that the Biden administration had provided.",
      "The Ukrainian leader conceded Thursday that it was \u201cnot very pleasant\u201d that the American president spoke first to Putin. But he said the main issue was to \u201cnot allow everything to go according to Putin\u2019s plan.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe cannot accept it, as an independent country, any agreements (made) without us,\u201d Zelenskyy said as he visited a nuclear power plant in western Ukraine.",
      "The track Trump is taking also has rocked Europe, much as his dismissive comments about France and Germany did during his first term.",
      "French Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Haddad described Europe as being at a turning point, with the ground shifting rapidly under its feet, and said Europe must wean itself off its reliance on the United States for its security. He warned that handing a victory to Russia in Ukraine could have repercussions in Asia, too.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re not sufficiently grasping the extent to which our world is changing. Both our competitors and our allies are busy accelerating,\u201d Haddad told broadcaster France Info on Thursday.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is not just the interests of Ukraine and the Europeans. Everyone would lose, starting with the United States. And I think the United States know that,\u201d he said.",
      "But Trump said Thursday that he trusts that Putin wants to find an end to the war.",
      "\u201cI trust him on the subject,\" the U.S. president offered. \u201cI think he\u2019d like to see something happen.\u201d",

      "Pope Francis was hospitalized Friday for the fourth time since he was elected in 2013",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis was hospitalized Friday for the fourth time since being elected in 2013, after he was diagnosed with bronchitis last week. Francis had part of one lung removed as a young man and has recurring bouts of bronchitis, especially in winter.",
      "The 88-year-old pontiff has had a series of other health problems. In addition to having had a large chunk of his large intestine removed in 2021, he now uses a wheelchair, cane or walker because of strained knee ligaments.",
      "Francis has a personal physician, Dr. Roberto Bernabei, who is an internist and geriatric specialist at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome. He also has a personal nurse, Massimiliano Strappetti, an employee of the Vatican health system whom Francis credited with saving his life when Strappetti diagnosed the 2021 intestinal problem.",

      "\u2014\u2014",
      "1957: In his native Argentina, Francis, then in his early 20s, suffered from a severe respiratory infection that forced doctors to remove part of one lung. He later recalled that a nurse saved his life at the time, deciding to double the amount of drugs he had been given.",
      "July 4-14, 2021: He spent 10 days in Gemelli hospital in Rome for what the Vatican said was a narrowing of the large intestine. Doctors removed 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon.

      "June 7-16, 2023: Francis had abdominal surgery to remove scar tissue and repair an abdominal hernia and was released nine days later. His surgeon, Dr. Sergio Alfieri, revealed that the scarring was not only due to the 2021 abdominal surgery, but to previous surgeries the pope had undergone.",
      "Feb. 14, 2025: Francis returned to Gemelli for treatment of bronchitis and further diagnostic tests, the Vatican said.",

      "Hamas militants have named the next three Israeli male hostages to be released as part of a fragile ceasefire deal that had teetered in recent days amid a major dispute that raised the specter of fighting resuming in the devastated Gaza Strip",
      "JERUSALEM -- Hamas militants on Friday named three Israeli male hostages to be released at the weekend as part of a fragile ceasefire deal that had teetered in recent days amid a major dispute that raised the specter of fighting resuming in the devastated Gaza Strip.",
      "Hamas and a forum representing families of hostages identified the three to be freed Saturday as Israeli-Argentinian Iair Horn, 46; Israeli-American Sagui Dekel Chen, 36; and Israeli-Russian Alexander (Sasha) Troufanov, 29. The trio were abducted from the same hard-hit kibbutz during the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.",
      "Under the terms of the ceasefire, which began on Jan. 21, Israel is to release more than 300 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails in return for the hostages. The exchange will be the sixth swap since the ceasefire came into effect.",
      "So far, 21 hostages and over 730 Palestinian prisoners have been freed during the first phase of the truce. But the ceasefire had appeared dangerously close to collapse in recent days.",
      "Hamas had said it would delay the next hostage release after accusing Israel of not adhering to the terms of the deal by not allowing enough shelters, medical supplies, fuel and heavy equipment for clearing rubble into Gaza.",
      "Israel, with the support of U.S. President Donald Trump, had retorted it would resume fighting Saturday unless hostages were freed - leaving it unclear whether it meant the three hostages as scheduled in the ceasefire deal, or all remaining hostages.",
      "An Israeli government official on Friday confirmed Israel had received the list of hostages to be released. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.",
      "Horn, Dekel Chen and Troufanov were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where some 80 of roughly 400 residents were taken hostage during the Oct. 7, 2023 attack.",
      "Horn was taken along with his brother, Eitan Horn, who had been staying with him at the time. Eitan remains in captivity.",
      "Dekel Chen had been working on a bus renovation when militants stormed the kibbutz. His wife, Avital, who was seven months pregnant at the time, hid in a safe room with their two daughters. Avital has since given birth to a third daughter while her husband has been in captivity.",
      "Troufanov was taken hostage along with his grandmother Irena Tati, mother Yelena (Lena) and girlfriend Sapir Cohen. The three women were released during a brief ceasefire in November 2023. Troufanov's father was killed in the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "Of the 251 people abducted, 73 remain in Gaza, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Nearly all the remaining hostages are men, including Israeli soldiers.",
      "Concern has been growing about the remaining hostages' condition, particularly after the release of three last Saturday, who emerged looking emaciated and frail.",
      "One of them, 65-year-old Keith Siegel, said in a video message addressed to Trump Friday that his captors had starved him and physically and emotionally tortured him.",
      "He said the militants who held him for 484 days treated him worse as the 15-month war intensified, kicking him, spitting on him and holding him with no water or light. The statement marked one of the first accounts of Hamas captivity from a hostage released during the ceasefire.",
      "\u201cWhen I was in Gaza, I lived in constant fear...for my life and my personal safety,\u201d he said.",
      "Siegel, originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, implored Trump to use his \u201cleadership and strength\u201d to ensure the ceasefire holds and all hostages return home.",
      "The truce faces a much bigger challenge in the coming weeks. The first phase is set to conclude at the beginning of March, and there have not yet been substantive negotiations over the second phase, in which Hamas would release all remaining hostages in return for an end to the war.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposal to remove some 2 million Palestinians from Gaza and settle them in other countries has thrown the truce\u2019s future into further doubt.",
      "His plan has been welcomed by Israel, but vehemently rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries which have refused to accept any influx of refugees. Human rights groups say it could amount to a war crime under international law.",
      "Trump has said Gaza\u2019s population should be resettled elsewhere in the region, with wealthy Arab countries paying for it. He has suggested that once the fighting ends, Israel would transfer control of Gaza to the United States, which would then redevelop it as the \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right allies are already calling for a resumption of the war after the first phase with the goal of implementing Trump\u2019s plan and annihilating Hamas, which remains in control of the territory after surviving one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history.",
      "Hamas may be unwilling to release any more hostages if it believes the war will resume. The captives are among the only bargaining chips it has left.",
      "The war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive has obliterated large parts of Gaza. At its height, the fighting had displaced 90% of the territory\u2019s population of 2.3 million. Hundreds of thousands have returned to their homes since the ceasefire took hold, though many have found only rubble, buried human remains and unexploded ordnance.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, echoing Trump, said Wednesday that \u201call hell will break loose\u201d if Hamas stops releasing hostages. He said a \u201cnew Gaza war\u201d wouldn\u2019t end until Hamas was defeated, which would allow for Trump\u2019s vision of mass displacement to be carried out.",
      "With far fewer hostages remaining in Gaza, Israel would have more freedom of action militarily.",
      "It would also face far fewer constraints from the United States, its main military patron. The Biden administration, while providing crucial military and diplomatic support, had occasionally pressed Israel to allow in more aid and at one point suspended some weapons shipments. It had also said there should be no permanent displacement of its Palestinian population.",
      "Trump has lifted restrictions on arms transfers, and his administration is pressing ahead with the sale of $7 billion worth of weapons approved under President Joe Biden.",

      "The home of Albania\u2019s late communist dictator Enver Hoxha is hosting international artists fascinated by the long-ruling leader\u2019s library, the country\u2019s history of isolation and its unique traditions",
      "TIRANA, Albania -- In a historical twist, the home of Albania\u2019s late communist dictator Enver Hoxha is hosting international artists fascinated by the long-ruling leader\u2019s library, the country\u2019s history of isolation and its unique traditions.",
      "The metamorphosis of Villa 31 \u2014 where the Hoxha family lived for decades until his regime was toppled in 1990, five years after his death \u2014 encapsulates Albania\u2019s radical transformation from one of the world\u2019s most hermetic countries into the modern society it is today.",
      "The sprawling, 4,000 square meter (43,000 square foot) house with more than 100 rooms, built in the 1970s in the capital of Tirana, was a heavily guarded place of power where Hoxha both ruled and feared his own people. Albania's ruler was known for his paranoid behavior and saw enemies everywhere.",
      "Now surrounded by high-rises, trendy bars, posh restaurants and pulsating nightclubs, the villa itself has undergone a transformation, complete with a fresh coat of paint \u2014 though the ostentatious downstairs hall with marble floors is still there.",
      "Gone are the heavy curtains that blocked sunlight. Long silent walls will from now on echo with poetry readings, experimental theater, film screenings and contemporary art exhibits. The rooms offer workshops and shared areas for 23 artists from 15 countries.",
      "The villa's rebirth stems from a pledge by Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama to visiting French President Emmanuel Macron in October 2023 to turn it into an artists\u2019 center \u2014 \u201csomething that would make Enver Hoxha roll in his grave.\u201d",
      "Closed off to the public until now, the villa has welcomed artists, residing there since late January, and hopes to soon see tourists too.",
      "\u201cThis is what I believe is the power of art, to deal with a past and a painful past, like the one that this villa symbolizes,\u201d said Nita Deda, manager of Art Explora, a French-based foundation that spearheaded the building's transformation.",
      "Inside the studios that replaced once labyrinthine apartments, visiting artists have the freedom to \u201cexpress everything, from fury to anger, to betrayal, to ambivalence, to the absurd ... exactly his (Hoxha's) worst nightmare,\u201d said Ukrainian artist Stanislava Pinchuk.",
      "Pinchuk, 37, says she is happy to come to Albania, the \u201clast puzzle piece\u201d of former communist countries, though she finds it difficult to sleep at the villa.",
      "She is baffled by Hoxha's library, which holds books by his communist idols \u2014 Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Lenin \u2014 to books about the French Revolution and students\u2019 protests in the former Czechoslovakia and Hungary in the 1950s and 1960s. There are also books on sex, which ordinary Albanians were banned from reading at the time.",
      "The library was a testament to \u201can ideology refusing to die,\" Pinchuk said.",
      "Reading \u201cKanun,\u201d a book on Albanian customs, Italian artist Genny Petrotta, 34, marveled at the practice of sworn virgins \u2014 a centuries-old tradition in which women declared themselves to be men so they could enjoy the same rights within the society that men enjoyed, though they did not considering themselves transgender.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a story about power,\" Petrotta said, adding that she was \u201cimpressed by the analytical way\u201d the book described the phenomenon.",
      "The villa\u2019s underground tunnels, built as shelters in case of an attack, also fascinated the visiting artists. Their exhibit will open in April, and Albanians, no longer fearful of the late dictator, will be able to view the art.",
      "Under Hoxha's repressive regime, some 100,000 Albanians were imprisoned, sent to internment camps or executed during the 46 years of his repressive regime.",
      "Albania today has seen its economy and society develop rapidly, and 10 million tourists visited the country last year.",
      "Some, however, disagree with Villa 31's transformation, and say it should have stayed untouched, a history lesson for the tourists and generations born long after Hoxha's regime collapsed.",
      "Xhevdet Lani, a taxi driver and an older resident of Tirana, said the villa is \u201chistoric evidence of what the dictatorship once was.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would have been better if it had remained for generations so that our children and grandchildren could learn from it,\u201d he said."

      "Increasingly alarmed that U.S. security priorities lie elsewhere, a group of European countries has been working on a plan to send troops to Ukraine to help enforce any future peace settlement with Russia",
      "BRUSSELS -- Increasingly alarmed that U.S. security priorities lie elsewhere, a group of European countries has been quietly working on a plan to send troops into Ukraine to help enforce any future peace settlement with Russia.",
      "Britain and France are at the forefront of the effort, though details remain scarce. The countries involved in the discussions are reluctant to tip their hand and give Russian President Vladimir Putin an edge should he agree to negotiate an end to the war he launched three years ago.",
      "What is clear is that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy needs a guarantee that his country's security will be assured until peace takes hold. The best protection would be the NATO membership that Ukraine has long been promised, but the U.S. has taken that option off the table.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t get into the particular capabilities, but I do accept that if there is peace then there needs to be some sort of security guarantee for Ukraine and the U.K. will play its part in that,\u201d British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in cautious remarks on Thursday.",
      "The Europeans began exploring what kind of force might be needed about a year ago, but the sense of urgency has grown amid concern that U.S. President Donald Trump might go over their heads, and possibly even Ukraine\u2019s, to clinch a deal with Putin.",
      "Many questions remain unanswered but one stands out: what role, if any, might the United States play?",
      "In December, after Trump was elected but before he took office, a group of leaders and ministers huddled with Zelenskyy at NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte\u2019s residence in Brussels. They came from Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland. Top European Union officials attended too.",
      "The talks built on an idea promoted by French President Emmanuel Macron in early 2024. At the time his refusal to rule out putting troops on the ground in Ukraine prompted an outcry, notably from the leaders of Germany and Poland.",
      "Macron appeared isolated on the European stage, but his plan has gained traction since.",
      "Still, much about what the force might look like and who will take part will depend on the terms of any peace settlement, and more.",
      "Italy has constitutional limits on the use of its forces. The Netherlands would need a greenlight from its parliament, as would Germany, whose position could evolve after the Feb. 23 elections usher in a new government. Poland is cautious, given lingering animosities with Ukraine that date from World War II.",
      "The makeup and role of the force will be dictated by the kind of peace deal that\u2019s reached. If Russia and Ukraine can agree terms as the negotiations progress, it\u2019s plausible that fewer security precautions and a smaller force would be needed.",
      "But experts and officials warn that, as things stand, the Europeans must deploy a robust and sizeable contingent, rather than a team of peacekeepers like United Nations \u201cblue helmets.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has to be a real force (so) that the Russians know that if they ever tested it that they would get crushed. And you can be sure that Russia will test it,\u201d Ben Hodges, the former Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe, said last month at a European Policy Centre think tank event.",
      "\u201cThey violate every single agreement. So if we send a force in there, they\u2019ve got to have airpower, large land forces, drones, counter-drones, air and missile defense. All of that,\" he said. \"If they go in there with a bunch of blue helmets and rifles, they will get crushed.\u201d",
      "Retired French General Dominique Trinquand, a former head of France\u2019s military mission at the United Nations, agreed that U.N. peacekeepers are better suited \u201cfor deployment in zones that are far more stable.\"",
      "\u201cFor starters, mounting this operation with soldiers taken from across the world would take about a year,\u201d he said.",
      "The nature of the peace deal will determine the size and location of the European contingent. Zelenskyy has insisted on at least 100,000 to 150,000 troops. Media reports have speculated about a 30,000-40,000 strong force. Diplomats and officials have not confirmed either figure.",
      "Ukraine also wants air support, not just boots on the ground.",
      "What is clear is that the Europeans would struggle to muster a large-scale force, and certainly could not do it quickly.",
      "In an interview on Friday with the Financial Times, Macron said that the idea of deploying a huge force is \u201cfar-fetched.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to do things that are appropriate, realistic, well thought, measured and negotiated,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insisted this week on \u201crobust international oversight of the line of contact,\u201d a reference to the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) long front line. The Europeans are reluctant as that would require too many troops.",
      "Nearly all agree that some kind of \u201cAmerican backstop\u201d is essential. European armed forces have long relied on superior U.S. logistics, air transport and other military capabilities.",
      "At NATO headquarters on Wednesday, Hegseth began describing the terms under which the U.S. might agree to a force that would help provide Ukraine with the \u201crobust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops,\u201d Hegseth told almost 50 of Ukraine\u2019s Western backers. If they go to Ukraine, he said, \u201cthey should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission.\u201d",
      "Putin has said that he launched the invasion in part due to NATO territory expanding too close to Russia\u2019s borders and is unlikely to accept any operation run by the world\u2019s biggest military organization.",
      "Any European allies taking part would not benefit from NATO\u2019s collective security guarantee if they were attacked, Hegseth said. He underlined that \u201cthere will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "He did not reveal what role the U.S. might play.",
      "From Ukraine's perspective, a Europe-only operation simply would not work. \u201cAny security guarantees are impossible without the Americans,\u201d Ukrainian Foreign Minister Sybiha warned on Thursday.",

      "The families of Israeli hostages still held by the Hamas militant group on Friday welcomed the \u201cjoyous news\u201d that three men, all taken from the same kibbutz on Oct. 7, 2023, are expected to be freed on Saturday.",
      "Hamas-led militants released the names of the male hostages in the latest indication that the fragile ceasefire deal that had teetered in recent days will hold.",
      "The Hostages Families Forum said Friday in a statement that Iair Horn, 46, Sagui Dekel Chen, 36, and Sasha Troufanov, 29, are set to be freed after 498 days in Hamas captivity.",
      "The news came after Hamas said Thursday it would release the next three Israeli hostages as planned this weekend in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Israel, with the support of U.S. President Donald Trump, has said it will resume fighting if the hostages are not freed, but did not immediately comment on the statement by Hamas.",
      "Hamas had said it was going to delay the hostage release because Israel wasn't keeping up its side of the ceasefire agreement. Hamas said Israel wasn't allowing enough shelters, medical supplies, fuel and heavy equipment for clearing rubble into Gaza, among other alleged violations of the truce.",
      "The sides have carried out five swaps since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19, freeing 21 hostages and over 730 Palestinian prisoners so far during the first phase of the truce. The war could resume if no agreement is reached on the more complicated second phase, which calls for the return of all remaining hostages captured in Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and an indefinite extension of the truce.",
      "Here's the latest:",
      "___",
      "RAMALLAH, West Bank \u2014 The Hamas-linked prisoners\u2019 information office says that a total of 369 Palestinians jailed by Israel will be released Saturday in exchange for three Israeli hostages held in Gaza.",
      "It said Friday that 36 of the Palestinians scheduled for release were serving life sentences. The statement did not specify how many of them would be released into exile in Egypt ahead of deportation to other countries as part of the agreement between Israel and Hamas.",
      "The rest of the 333 Palestinians were from Gaza, all arrested after Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 that ignited the 15-month war in Gaza.",
      "Under the ceasefire deal, Israel committed to release more than 1,000 Palestinians from Gaza detained during the Israeli invasion of the enclave on the condition that they had not participated in the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "The Palestinian Authority did not immediately announce the names of those set to be freed Saturday.",
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 The three men set to be freed by Hamas on Saturday in the sixth wave of hostage releases under the Israel-Hamas ceasefire are all Israeli civilians with dual nationalities.",
      "All were from the same communal farm, Kibbutz Nir Oz, where some 80 of roughly 400 residents were taken hostage in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack.",
      "The men are Israeli-Argentinian Iair Horn, 46, Israel-Russian Alexander (Sasha) Troufanov, 29, and Israeli-American Sagui Dekel Chen, 36.",
      "Horn is an Israel-Argentinian who was kidnapped along with his brother, Eitan Horn, who was staying with him at the time. Eitan Horn remains in Hamas captivity.",
      "Chen was outside working on a bus renovation when militants stormed the kibbutz. His wife, Avital, hid in the safe room with their two daughters. Avital was seven months pregnant and gave birth to a third daughter, Shachar Mazal, in December, while Dekel Chen was in captivity.",
      "Israeli-Russian Sasha Trufanov was taken hostage along with three members of his family: grandmother Irena Tati, mother Yelena (Lena) and his girlfriend Sapir Cohen. Sasha\u2019s father Vitaly Trufanov was killed on October 7, 2023. The rest of his family was released in a brief ceasefire period November 2023.",
      "Hamas released the names in a statement earlier Friday. Saturday\u2019s release will be the sixth since the Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect.",
      "ANKARA, Turkey - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan continued his strong criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza, arguing that the U.S. president was making a mistake by trusting Israeli \u201clies\u201d and disregarding the \u201chistory and values\u201d of the region.",
      "Speaking to a group of journalists on his return from a trip to three Asian nations, Erdogan urged Trump to fulfil his promises to promote peace rather than conflict.",
      "\u201cBelieving what (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu \u2014 whose legal process is still ongoing in his country \u2014 says will do nothing but shed blood in the region,\u201d Erdogan said, according to a transcript of comments that were made available to The Associated Press on Friday. \u201cThis will not bring the longed-for peace, on the contrary, it will deepen conflicts and increase blood and tears.\u201d",
      "Erdogan, a vocal advocate of Palestinian rights, also appeared to suggest that the U.S. president should refrain from taking decisions regarding the region without consultations.",
      "\u201cThere is no room for a \u2018it\u2019s done whether you like it or not\u2019 approach in this region,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cThe expulsion of the Palestinian people from Gaza is unacceptable.\u201d",

      "After nearly 500 days in captivity in Gaza, with little access to media, recently freed hostages have many questions",
      "RAMAT GAN, Israel -- After 484 days of captivity in Gaza, Keith Siegel had many questions. Was his 97-year-old mother still alive? Which of his neighbors was killed in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack? Why did it take so long to free him?",
      "With minimal access to media, the dual American-Israeli citizen only learned months after he was captured that his son had survived the attack that launched the war in Gaza. He had heard that his family and others' were advocating for hostages' freedom. But beyond that, he knew very little about life outside his confines in Gaza.",
      "\u201cHe really wanted to know everything as soon as possible, just to put all the question marks away and to know what happened,\u201d said his daughter, Elan Siegel.",
      "Hostages freed as part of a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza are confronting a flood of information about loved ones and destroyed communities, and are still figuring out their place in a changed world. Their families are grappling with how to fill them in on what they missed without potentially deepening their trauma.",
      "Experts say it is important to be cautious.",
      "\u201cThe information is definitely traumatic so you have to really be sensitive, careful and monitor the pace in which you expose the information,\u201d said Einat Yehene, who heads the rehabilitation division at the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.",
      "For many freed captives, catching up has been excruciating.",
      "Eli Sharabi, 52, had no exposure to media during his 16-month ordeal, according to his brother, Sharon Sharabi.",
      "Forced to speak at a staged Hamas ceremony before his release, a gaunt Sharabi told a crowd of masked militants and journalists that he was looking forward to seeing his wife and two teenage daughters back in Israel.",
      "Then he learned the crushing reality shortly after his arrival in Israel: all three had been killed at home during the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "\u201cBeyond the emotional burden and difficult experiences he faced in captivity, he had to bear this horrible loss on the first day that he left from there,\u201d his brother told Israeli Army Radio.",
      "Or Levy, 34, was dealt a similar blow upon being freed. That is when he learned that his wife, Einav, was killed on Oct. 7.",
      "\u201cFor 491 days, he held onto hope that he would return to her,\u201d his brother, Michael Levy, told reporters.",
      "Levy was reunited with his young son, who hit key developmental milestones, like being potty trained, while his father was in captivity. \u201cIt took you a long time to come back,\u201d the 3-year-old told his father, according to Israeli media.",
      "The first person Keith Siegel asked about upon returning home was his mother, Gladys. When his wife's eyes welled up, he immediately understood she had died, his daughter recounted.",
      "Siegel picked up some information about his family while in captivity. Months into the war, he heard his daughter on the radio, speaking about how his son had survived Hamas' attack. Other freed hostages have also reported hearing messages from their families through the news media.",
      "Yarden Bibas, who was freed earlier this month, was told by his captors that his wife, Shiri, and their two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, were dead. But he was also told they were spotted in Tel Aviv, according to Israeli media.",
      "Now that he is out, he still lacks clarity. They remain in Gaza, and the Israeli government has said it has \u201cserious concern\u201d for their lives.",
      "Beyond their personal lives, freed hostages are also taking in more than a year's worth of world events: President Donald Trump is back in the White House; Israel and Iran engaged in their first direct attacks; Israel killed the longtime chief of the militant group Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah.",
      "Keith Siegel's family is sharing information sparingly, as one might with a child. \u201cYou answer only what he asks and not more than that,\u201d his daughter, Elan, said.",
      "But the questions are relentless.",
      "Siegel wanted to know what happened to his community of Kfar Aza. Was anyone watering the plants? Who was killed in Hamas' attack?",
      "\u201cWe asked him if he\u2019s sure that he\u2019s ready. And he said \u2018yes,\u2019 that he just wants to know. So I read him the list of 64 people\" who were killed, his daughter said. She said his reaction to the news has been muted because \u201cit's almost like he forgot how to feel\u201d while in captivity.",
      "Siegel's photo has been a mainstay at protests and on banners highlighting the plight of hostages, making him recognizable across Israel. Ahead of his release, dozens of Israelis posted videos of themselves on social media making his favorite pancake recipe.",
      "Siegel's wife, Aviva, who was freed from captivity in the early weeks of the war, prepared a book for him that includes notes from the important figures she had lobbied on his behalf \u2014 from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to former U.S. President Joe Biden.",
      "Siegel was especially befuddled by the revelation that world leaders knew about his captivity.",
      "His daughter, Elan, recalled him saying: \"If they knew, how can it be that I was there for so long?\u201d",

      "Researchers who sniffed mummified remains in the name of science were greeted more with a blessing than a curse",
      "LONDON -- At first whiff, it sounds repulsive: sniff the essence of an ancient corpse.",
      "But researchers who indulged their curiosity in the name of science found that well-preserved Egyptian mummies actually smell pretty good.",
      "\u201cIn films and books, terrible things happen to those who smell mummified bodies,\u201d said Cecilia Bembibre, director of research at University College London's Institute for Sustainable Heritage. \u201cWe were surprised at the pleasantness of them.\"",
      "\u201cWoody,\u201d \u201cspicy\u201d and \u201csweet\u201d were the leading descriptions from what sounded more like a wine tasting than a mummy sniffing exercise. Floral notes were also detected, which could be from pine and juniper resins used in embalming.",
      "The study published Thursday in the Journal of the American Chemical Society used both chemical analysis and a panel of human sniffers to evaluate the odors from nine mummies as old as 5,000 years that had been either in storage or on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.",
      "The researchers wanted to systematically study the smell of mummies because it has long been a subject of fascination for the public and researchers alike, said Bembibre, one of the report\u2019s authors. Archeologists, historians, conservators and even fiction writers have devoted pages of their work to the subject \u2014 for good reason.",
      "Scent was an important consideration in the mummification process that used oils, waxes and balms to preserve the body and its spirit for the afterlife. The practice was largely reserved for pharaohs and nobility and pleasant smells were associated with purity and deities while bad odors were signs of corruption and decay.",
      "Without sampling the mummies themselves, which would be invasive, researchers from UCL and the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia were able to measure whether aromas were coming from the archaeological item, pesticides or other products used to conserve the remains, or from deterioration due to mold, bacteria or microorganisms.",
      "\u201cWe were quite worried that we might find notes or hints of decaying bodies, which wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d said Matija Strli\u010d, a chemistry professor at the University of Ljubljana. \u201cWe were specifically worried that there might be indications of microbial degradation, but that was not the case, which means that the environment in this museum, is actually quite good in terms of preservation.\u201d",
      "Using technical instruments to measure and quantify air molecules emitted from sarcophagi to determine the state of preservation without touching the mummies was like the Holy Grail, Strli\u010d said.",
      "\"It tells us potentially what social class a mummy was from and and therefore reveals a lot of information about the mummified body that is relevant not just to conservators, but to curators and archeologists as well,\" he said. \u201cWe believe that this approach is potentially of huge interest to other types of museum collections.\u201d",
      "Barbara Huber, a postdoctoral researcher at Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Germany who was not involved in the study, said the findings provide crucial data on compounds that could preserve or degrade mummified remains. The information could be used to better protect the ancient bodies for future generations.",
      "\u201cHowever, the research also underscores a key challenge: the smells detected today are not necessarily those from the time of mummification,\u201d Huber said. \u201cOver thousands of years, evaporation, oxidation, and even storage conditions have significantly altered the original scent profile.\u201d",
      "Huber authored a study two years ago that analyzed residue from a jar that had contained mummified organs of a noblewoman to identify embalming ingredients, their origins and what they revealed about trade routes. She then worked with a perfumer to create an interpretation of the embalming scent, known as \u201cScent of Eternity,\u201d for an exhibition at the Moesgaard Museum in Denmark.",
      "Researchers of the current study hope to do something similar, using their findings to develop \u201csmellscapes\u201d to artificially recreate the scents they detected and enhance the experience for future museumgoers.",
      "\u201cMuseums have been called white cubes, where you are prompted to read, to see, to approach everything from a distance with your eyes,\u201d Bembibre said. \u201cObserving the mummified bodies through a glass case reduces the experience because we don\u2019t get to smell them. We don\u2019t get to know about the mummification process in an experiential way, which is one of the ways that we understand and engage with the world.\u201d",

      "Demonstrators have been blocking the road to the airport and other roads in the capital to protest a decision by Lebanese authorities to revoke permission for a passenger plane from Iran to fly to Beirut on Thursday, leaving dozens of Lebanese passengers stranded.",
      "The decision to ban the Iranian plane came after the Israeli army issued a statement claiming that Iran was smuggling cash to the militant group Hezbollah via civilian flights, leading some in Lebanon to allege that their country's authorities had caved in the face of a threat from Israel.",

      "In areas where Israeli forces pull out, the Lebanese army and UNIFIL are tasked with ensuring Hezbollah does not reestablish a military presence.",
      "The deadline for Israel and Hezbollah to withdraw was initially set for late January, but Israel and Lebanon agreed to extend it.

      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said Thursday that his country had proposed a beefed-up UNIFIL presence, including French forces, in place of Israeli troops at those five points. The monitoring committee also includes France, Lebanon, Israel and UNIFIL.",
      "UNIFIL was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after Israel\u2019s 1978 invasion.

      "Radiation levels have not increased, Zelenskyy and the U.N. atomic agency said.",

      "Zelenskyy said that the drone strike damaged the structure and started a fire, which has been put out.",

      "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n believes U.S. President Donald Trump will reintegrate Russia into the Western economy and energy sector if the Ukraine war ends",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- U.S. President Donald Trump's administration will reconnect Russia with the economies and energy networks of Western countries if the war in Ukraine, now nearly three years old, comes to an end, Hungary's nationalist prime minister said on Friday.",
      "In comments on state radio, Viktor Orb\u00e1n said Trump had initiated a comprehensive shift in approach among Western nations to numerous issues, including Russia's war, and Trump's recent efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict would result in Moscow being drawn back into the Western fold.",
      "\"If the American president makes peace, if an agreement is made, I think Russia will be reintegrated into the world economy, reintegrated into the European security system, and even European energy,\" said Orb\u00e1n, who is close to Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cThis will give the Hungarian economy a huge boost. It's a big opportunity. We gain a lot in peace.\u201d",
      "A phone call between Trump and Putin on Wednesday, during which they agreed to begin negotiations on ending the war, abruptly ended a three-year, U.S.-led effort to isolate the Russian leader over Ukraine and raised concerns in Kyiv and other European capitals that a negotiated settlement could take place without their direct participation.",
      "But Orb\u00e1n, who has long been critical of Western efforts to support Ukraine's defense and threatened to veto European Union sanctions against Moscow, praised Trump for his discussions with Putin, saying the U.S. president \u201cwants peace.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe United States has initiated a change that puts the whole Western world\u2019s system of arguments, value system, and way of thinking on a new track,\u201d he said. \u201cThis process is progressing much faster than many people thought. We call this the Trump tornado.\u201d",
      "Hungary, unlike the majority of European countries, has continued to rely heavily on Russian oil and gas even after Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, and has been a staunch critic of EU sanctions against Russia's energy sector.",
      "On Friday, he predicted the EU would \u201cfall apart\u201d if energy prices across the bloc were not brought down.",
      "\"I personally became convinced in 2010, 2011 that the European Union was done for,\" he said. \u201cIf the Germans and the French do not figure something out and put the European Union on a new trajectory, then its days are numbered.

      "HONG KONG -- Tens of thousands of people in densely populated, land-poor Hong Kong live in tiny dwellings made by dividing up apartments, most smaller than a parking space. It's an affordable option for students and low-income families but can also mean banging shins in cramped and in some cases substandard living spaces.",
      "The city's government has proposed new rules that would set minimum standards for such housing units, but residents and advocates for the poor worry that it could drive up rents and make it even harder to hang on in the city. The city's eventual goal, mandated by Beijing, is to eliminate subdivided apartments over the next 25 years.",
      "Officials are aiming to pass the rules into law within the year. After that, landlords will have a grace period to make their substandard flats meet the bar. The government has promised to assist affected residents in resettlement and adopt a gradual approach in its policy implementation to avoid causing panic.",

      "NEW DELHI -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk during his visit to the U.S. to meet President Donald Trump. The exact nature of the meeting is unclear, although Modi said on X that the two men \u201cdiscussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology and innovation.\u201d",
      "Musk was recently chosen by Trump to head a new U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",

      "Modi and Musk met each other on Thursday during the Indian prime minister\u2019s visit to the U.S. While Musk was accompanied by his three young children, Modi was notably flanked by his top advisers \u2014 including External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.",
      "Later, at a joint press conference with Modi at the White House, Trump said he wasn\u2019t sure why Musk met the Indian prime minister but he assumed Musk \"wants to do business in India.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would imagine he met, possibly, because you know he\u2019s running a company,\u201d Trump told reporters.",
      "India\u2019s foreign ministry in a statement said Modi and Musk \u201cdiscussed strengthening collaboration between Indian and U.S. entities in innovation, space exploration, artificial intelligence and sustainable development\u201d and on \u201centrepreneurship and good governance.\u201d",
      "Musk, who previously called himself a \u201cfan of Modi,\" has long wanted his Starlink satellite internet service to make an entry into the Indian market. Its launch, however, has been delayed due to regulatory challenges, security concerns and opposition from domestic telecom giants like Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio.",
      "Last November, India\u2019s telecoms minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, said Starlink was yet to comply with security norms, and a license for satellite communications services will be issued only after the company meets all the requirements.",
      "Musk had earlier criticized India's policy of granting spectrum for satellite services through auctioning. The Indian government later changed the policy and said it will assign satellite spectrum and not auction it.",
      "India\u2019s satellite broadband service market is highly competitive. At least six companies control the market, led by Ambani\u2019s Reliance Jio.",
      "Apart from regulatory roadblocks, Musk's Starlink has also faced resistance by Reliance Jio, which last year said granting spectrum for satellite services through auctioning is necessary to ensure fair competition.",
      "Musk\u2019s Starlink has at least 6,900 active satellites orbiting Earth that provide low-latency broadband to some 4.6 million people. But if Musk wants to enter the Indian market, Starlink's high pricing could be a concern.",
      "Mobile data in India is among the cheapest globally, and Ambani's Jio once gave data for free on its mobile plans. And yet, at least 40% of the country\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people still don\u2019t have access to the internet. Cheap satellite broadband is needed to bridge this gap, particularly in India\u2019s vast remote and mountainous areas.",
      "Musk\u2019s Tesla has also been waiting to get into India, which is one of the world\u2019s largest automobile markets, but has faced hurdles due to high import duties on vehicles brought into the country.",
      "Also, India\u2019s electric vehicle market is still nascent and made up a little more than 2% of total car sales last year. But the government wants to change that and increase the electric vehicle share to 30% by 2030.",
      "India also recently unveiled a new policy that extends concessional tariffs on fully imported electric vehicles made by foreign carmakers who commit to starting local manufacturing.",

      "Beginning July 1, unions serving Utah teachers, firefighters, police officers, transit workers and other public employees will be banned from negotiating on their behalf for better wages and working conditions.",
      "Gov. Spencer Cox announced his decision Friday evening following a week of rallies outside his office in which thousands of union members from the public and private sector urged him to veto the bill. The Republican-controlled Legislature had narrowly approved it last week after its sponsors abandoned a proposed compromise that would have removed the outright ban.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that, in this case, the process did not ultimately deliver the compromise that at one point was on the table and that some stakeholders had accepted,\" Cox said in a statement announcing he had signed the bill.",
      "The measure did not pass with veto-proof margins, meaning that if Cox had rejected it, Republican supporters would have needed to pull in more support to override his veto.",
      "Utah joins North Carolina and South Carolina as the most restrictive states for public sector unions, said John Logan, a labor expert at San Francisco State University.",
      "Many educators, who are the state\u2019s most frequent users of collective bargaining, view the new law as way for Republicans to curb the political influence of teachers unions and clear a path for their own education agenda.",

      "The Utah Education Association, the state\u2019s largest public education employees\u2019 union, criticized Cox for ignoring the many workers who urged him to issue a veto. The union is exploring a possible ballot referendum to try to overturn the law, though the effort would come with a high price tag.",

      "Students at the state\u2019s public colleges and universities will only be allowed to enter or live in a gendered space, such as a dorm building, locker room or bathroom, that corresponds with their sex assigned at birth. It's the first transgender restriction explicitly aimed at university housing, though some states have broad bathroom laws that could be interpreted to apply to dorms."

      "Americans looking to buy a newly built home this spring are likely to get a helping hand with their mortgage rate and other costs",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Americans looking to buy a newly built home this spring are likely to get a helping hand with their mortgage rate and other costs.",
      "Many homebuilders are offering buyers valuable incentives like paying down their mortgage rate, covering closing costs or even throwing in \u201cflex dollars\u201d that home shoppers can put toward upgrades or other costs.",
      "While the sales strategy isn\u2019t new, builders are under pressure this year to ramp up such incentives because they\u2019re facing a tough spring homebuying season.",
      "Stubbornly high mortgage rates, more competition from existing homes on the market and the realization that years of rising home prices have pushed affordability to the limit for many prospective buyers gives builders little opportunity to ease off the costly incentives.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re running into more competition, fewer buyers and increased costs to sell a home,\u201d said Ali Wolf, chief economist at Zonda.",
      "And dialing back incentives may not be easy, as home shoppers have now come to expect them.",
      "\u201cWe should anticipate that builder incentives are here to stay,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a world where they don\u2019t need them, unless interest rates came down, and most signs point to higher-for-longer with interest rates.\u201d",
      "Elevated mortgage rates and rising prices have kept many prospective home shoppers on the sidelines, especially first-time buyers who don\u2019t have equity from an existing home to put toward a purchase. While mortgage rates have eased in recent weeks, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has been hovering around 7% since November after climbing from a 2-year low of just over 6% in September, according to Freddie Mac.",
      "Builders have increasingly relied on buyer incentives to mitigate the impact of higher borrowing costs on home shoppers as the average rate on a 30-year mortgage more than doubled in recent years from its pandemic-era historic low of 2.65%. Many builders have also lowered prices.",
      "The share of homebuilders that offer sales incentives has ranged between 60% and 64% since June, while between 30% and 33% have lowered prices, according to surveys by the National Association of Home Builders.",
      "The use of buyer incentives helped drive sales of new homes higher last year, while the resale home market remained in a deep slump. Sales of newly built single-family homes rose 2.6% last year to around 1.02 million units, the highest level since 2021, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in 2024 to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "While mortgage buydowns and other incentives can help builders entice buyers, their cost eats into their profit margins. The average operating margin for 12 of the largest homebuilders, including D.R. Horton, PulteGroup and Lennar, was 15.08% in the fourth-quarter, according to data compiled by FactSet. That\u2019s down from an average of 16.3% in the same period a year earlier.",
      "The concern now is that builders will have to maintain, if not boost, buyer incentives to continue mitigating the impact of high mortgage rates at a time when home shoppers have a wider selection to choose from. Last month, active listings \u2014 a tally that encompasses all homes on the market except those pending a finalized sale \u2014 were up 25% from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Rising construction costs and uncertainty over the impact that the Trump administration\u2019s trade and immigration policies may have on building materials and labor costs, respectively, are also fueling worries on Wall Street about how well builder profit margins will hold up this year.",
      "\u201cWe expect order growth to come at the expense of margins for homebuilders,\u201d analysts at BofA Securities wrote in a recent research note. They also said they expect a \u201cchallenging environment for homebuilders to persist\u201d through the first half of this year.",
      "Concern over builders\u2019 profit margins has weighed on the stocks, with many homebuilders off to a downbeat start this year after lagging the overall stock market in 2024.",
      "D.R. Horton, the nation\u2019s largest builder by closings, is down around 7.5% this year. Lennar is down 5.6% and NVR is off 10.2%.",
      "The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF, which tracks a variety of building products companies, is up 1.4%. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up about 4%.",

      "The average temperature in January was the lowest since 1988, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics, and was particularly disruptive in the South. Devastating fires in Los Angeles may have also impacted spending.",

Sales rose at general merchandise stores, a category that includes big retailers like Walmart and Target, and at restaurants and bars.",
      "In addition to cold weather, the decline could reflect falling consumer confidence as reflected in recent surveys by the Conference Board and University of Michigan. Still, hiring and wage growth have been steady, suggesting the economy is still expanding. Last week the government reported that the unemployment rate fell for the second straight month to a low 4%.",
      "Yet inflation also ticked higher last month, underscoring its persistence despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool prices through higher interest rates. The cost of groceries jumped in January from the previous month, pushed higher by soaring egg prices. Rising costs could be exacting a toll on shoppers.",
      "President Donald Trump is also stepping up tariff threats, which could raise prices further.

It represented a significant escalation by the White House in a four-day dispute with the AP over access to the presidency.",
      "The administration has blocked the AP from covering a handful of events at the White House this week, including a news conference with India's leader and several times in the Oval Office. It\u2019s all because the news outlet has not followed Trump\u2019s lead in renaming the body of water, which lies partially outside U.S. territory, to the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "AP reporters and photographers travel with the president virtually everywhere as part of a press \u201cpool\u201d and have for decades. AP journalism serves millions of readers and thousands of news outlets around the world.",
      "Journalists consider the administration's move a violation of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment \u2014 a governmental attempt to dictate what a news company publishes under threat of retribution. The Trump administration says the AP has no special right of access to events where space is limited, particularly given the news service's \u201ccommitment to misinformation.\u201d",

      "\u201cFreedom of speech is a pillar of American democracy and a core value of the American people. The White House has said it supports these principles,\u201d AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said Friday night. \u201cThe actions taken to restrict AP\u2019s coverage of presidential events because of how we refer to a geographic location chip away at this important right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution for all Americans.\u201d",
      "The body of water in question has been called the Gulf of Mexico for hundreds of years. AP, whose influential stylebook is used by news outlets as an arbiter of language and usage, advised that because of its broad set of global customers, it would both refer to the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico and also reference Trump\u2019s order changing the name to the Gulf of America within the United States.",
      "At the same time, the AP switched style last month from Denali to Mount McKinley for the mountain in Alaska that Trump ordered renamed. That location lies entirely within U.S. jurisdiction.",
      "Taylor Budowich, White House deputy chief of staff, said in a post to X Friday \u2014 one that was later released as a White House statement \u2014 that the AP \u201ccontinues to ignore the lawful geographic name change of the Gulf of America. This decision is not just divisive, but it also exposes The Associated Press\u2019 commitment to misinformation.\u201d",

      "Other news organizations, like The New York Times and Washington Post, have also said they would primarily use Gulf of Mexico. Fox News said that it was switching to Gulf of America.",
      "The White House Correspondents Association has issued statements condemning the action against AP. Although there are talks going on behind the scenes, individual news outlets have been relatively quiet.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A European naval force in the Middle East helped free a Yemeni fishing boat seized by suspected Somali pirates off the Horn of Africa, authorities said.",
      "The naval force, known as EUNAVFOR Atalanta, said late Thursday the incident remained under investigation. It said the 12 mariners on board were safe and uninjured.",

      "\u201cThe immediate presence of Atalanta forces in the area, especially the helicopter, was decisive in the fishing vessel liberation,\u201d EUNAVFOR said. \u201cThe crew confirmed that the alleged pirates abandoned the vessel after stealing personal objects and two skiffs belonging to the dhow.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 07:54:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Record high egg prices prompted Nevada lawmakers to unanimously back suspending their cage-free egg law, but the six other states with similar laws in effect have shown no sign of dropping them even if it might help lower grocery bills",
    "story": [
      "Record high egg prices prompted Nevada lawmakers to unanimously back suspending their cage-free egg law, but the six other states with similar laws in effect have shown no sign of dropping them even if it might help lower grocery bills",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Back when egg prices remained securely under $2 a dozen in 2021, Nevada joined several other states concerned about animal welfare in requiring cage-free eggs.",
      "Now four years later, a dozen eggs costs an average of nearly $5 in the U.S. because of the lingering bird flu, so Nevada passed a law the governor signed Thursday that will allow the state to suspend that law temporarily in hopes of getting residents some relief at the checkout counter.",
      "But it is not quite that simple, which is why the other six states with the same laws are so far reticent to follow suit.",
      "By relaxing the rule, Nevada might get access to additional eggs, but the supply of all eggs remains tight because nearly 159 million birds have been slaughtered since the bird flu outbreak began in 2022 to help limit virus spread. The virus prompts the slaughter of entire flocks anytime it is found.",
      "It is not clear dropping cage-free laws will have a significant effect on egg prices that have peaked at an average of $4.95 per dozen because the farmers who collectively invested several billion dollars in making the switch can\u2019t easily go back to raising chickens packed together in massive barns that they already spent the money to convert.",
      "Even if all the cage-free laws went away, big corporations like McDonald\u2019s and Sodexo remain committed to buying only those kind of eggs, ensuring strong demand for cage-free eggs.",
      "University of Arkansas agricultural economist Jada Thompson said opening up Nevada to all kinds of eggs \u201ccould ease egg prices in Nevada very slightly,\u201d but that it might make prices worse elsewhere because supplies are so tight.",
      "But Nevada is going to give it a try even if California, Massachusetts, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Michigan don't seem to be considering it. Arizona, Rhode Island and Utah also have cage-free laws on the books, but theirs won't take effect for at least a couple more years.",
      "Democratic Assemblymember Howard Watts III, who raises chickens in his Nevada backyard, advocated for the 2021 bill to promote the \u201cstandard of humane treatment\u201d of the animals. But the ongoing bird flu outbreak in the U.S. has caused egg prices to to hit a record high, and cage-free eggs are generally even more expensive.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that was not foreseen at that time was this major animal disease outbreak,\u201d Watts testified Tuesday. \u201cAs a result, there was no regulatory flexibility to suspend those requirements in the event of a major supply chain disruption.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo approved the legislation Thursday. Nevada Department of Agriculture Director J.J. Goicoechea is expected to authorize the 120-day suspension of the cage-free egg requirements within a day, according to Goicoechea's spokesperson Ciara Ressel.",
      "\u201cWe anticipate 30 days before we can see an impact at the grocery stores,\u201d Ressel said.",
      "This month\u2019s jump in egg prices was the biggest since the nation\u2019s last bird flu outbreak in 2015. The previous high was set two years ago when eggs were selling for $4.82 per dozen on average.",
      "The average prices mask just how bad it is in some places. Some Californians these days are shelling out $12.99 for a dozen, or more than a buck an egg. Some New York shops even started selling bundles of three eggs to help people who can't afford a full dozen.",
      "Nevada resident Nancy Wong said she has been \u201coutraged\u201d by egg prices in the state. \u201cWe have gone to the store and eggs have been either rationed or completely out,\u201d she said.",
      "The concern with the cage-free requirements is that only about 121 million of the 304 million chickens laying eggs nationwide are raised on cage-free farms, so the supply is limited.",
      "Many of the eggs those hens produce are promised to restaurant chains like McDonald's and Panera, food service giants like Sodexo and Aramark and grocers under long-term contracts that help keep prices down. But even when they do have to pay a premium, grocers sometimes lose money on eggs by selling them cheaply to try to get shoppers in the door.",
      "The number of cage-free chickens has steadily increased in recent years because of the laws and the pressure from the companies buying eggs, increasing exponentially from just 38 million at the start of 2017. But the United Egg Producers trade group has estimated it would take at least 226 million cage-free hens to meet all the demand for those eggs, and more customers are clamoring for them, so the supply is tight.",
      "The total flock of chickens nationwide used to number above 330 million before the bird flu outbreak began.",
      "Even as more egg farmers were converting to cage-free setups over the past decade, prices stayed between $1.40 and $2 per dozen most of the time with only the normal seasonal price spikes around Easter and Thanksgiving until this current bird flu outbreak began in early 2022.",
      "If bird flu outbreaks happen to hit cage-free farms hard, there are fewer eggs out there that can replace the lost ones. For example, out of the nearly 47 million birds slaughtered just since the start of December, more than 3 million of them were on five cage-free farms in California.",
      "Anytime birds must be killed, it takes months for a farm to resume producing eggs because of the time required to dispose of the carcasses, sanitize the barns and raise new chickens until they are about 5 months old and capable of laying eggs.",
      "California won\u2019t consider dropping its cage-free law in part because the rule came from a measure voters passed in 2018, so voters would have to approve any major changes.",
      "But there doesn't seem to be much support for changes in other states either.",
      "Michigan state Rep. Jerry Neyer, a dairy farmer and chair of the state House Agriculture Committee, said the idea that new cage-free laws are driving up egg prices is a \u201cmisconception.\u201d The Republican added that most farms already adapted to comply with the law, so dropping the mandate wouldn't cut costs.",
      "A bill to repeal Colorado\u2019s cage-free requirements, which just took effect on Jan. 1, was killed in its first committee vote last month. The sponsor, Republican state Rep. Ryan Gonzalez, argued that while the avian flu was a major factor in prices, the cage-free rules played a significant role. But the majority of lawmakers on the panel appeared skeptical.",
      "Jonathan Kuester, who runs the small Historic Wagner Farm with about 200 Red Star hens in Illinois just outside Chicago, said he doesn't think cage-free practices are the cause of the egg shortages.",
      "He acknowledged his farm is more vulnerable to a bird flu infection than a traditional farm where chickens are confined inside a barn that can be better protected. Kuester's birds roam free, where they might interact with ducks and geese that are the main carriers of the disease.",
      "\u201cThe egg shortage that people are seeing is a result of some fairly large flocks being euthanized, and so fewer chickens are currently laying than were three or four months ago,\" Kuester said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a little bit of a panic, too. People are suddenly buying eggs as quickly as they can, and so you see that shortage.\"",

      "An AP reporter was prevented from entering a news conference where President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi answered questions, effectively shutting out thousands of global news outlets that rely on the news organization.",

      "\u201cWe urge the Trump administration in the strongest terms to stop this practice,\u201d Pace, who also wrote to Trump's chief of staff on Wednesday, said in a statement. \u201cThis is now the third day AP reporters have been barred from covering the president \u2014 first as a member of the pool, and now from a formal press conference \u2014 an incredible disservice to the billions of people who rely on The Associated Press for nonpartisan news.\u201d",

      "Hong Kong plans to crack down on poor-quality subdivided flats are leaving many low-income residents uncertain about their future in one of the world\u2019s most expensive housing markets",
      "HONG KONG -- Jimmy Au\u2019s world shrinks to about the size of a parking space whenever she gets home.",
      "Her cramped Hong Kong home is one of four units carved out of what was once a single apartment. Most of the space is occupied by the bunk bed she shares with her husband and son, and their sleep is often disrupted by neighbors returning late or heading out early. Au\u2019s son often gets bruises bumping into things. Privacy is limited, with only a curtain separating the bathroom from the kitchen.",
      "But what troubles Au most about her home is that she might lose it. Hong Kong's government is planning to crack down on what it calls inadequate housing in subdivided apartments, mandating a minimum size and other baseline standards for homes like Au's. A public consultation period ended on Monday, and the government is aiming to pass the rules into law this year.",
      "The proposed rules leave many low-income residents like Au uncertain about their future in one of the world\u2019s most expensive housing markets.",
      "Au, a homemaker who moved from mainland China nine years ago, said her family pays about $460 a month in rent, about half of the income her husband makes from irregular renovation jobs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid the rent will get so high we can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Au said, sitting on the bed's lower bunk, surrounded by clothes, a fan and plastic storage drawers.",
      "Housing is a sensitive issue in Hong Kong, one of the world's least affordable cities. Some 7.5 million people live in a small territory that's mostly made up of steep slopes. Just 7%, or 80 square kilometers (30 square miles), of the city's total land is residential. The average price of an apartment of less than 40 square meters (430 square feet) last December ranged from about $13,800 to $16,800 per square meter, depending on the district.",
      "Beijing, which sees the city\u2019s housing problems as a driver of the 2019 anti-government protests, wants the city to phase out subdivided units by 2049. The government is also boosting the public housing supply, aiming to provide 189,000 flats over the next five years.",
      "But some 220,000 people rely on subdivided units, including migrants, workers, students and young professionals.",
      "Most subdivided homes are not far from the standards, the government said, but an estimated 33,000 units would need major renovations to meet them.",
      "The proposed rules would mandate a minimum size of at least eight square meters (86 square feet), a bar the government says it meant to leave room for low-priced housing. Every unit will also need to have a window, a toilet exclusively for the occupants' use, and a door to separate the toilet from other parts of the home, among other criteria.",
      "Landlords will have a grace period to renovate. After that, violations could lead to up to three years' imprisonment and a maximum fine of about $38,500.",
      "Security guard Fafa Ching has lived in multiple subdivided flats for over a decade. Her current unit costs about $490 per month and lacks even a bathroom sink, forcing her to collect water from the showerhead with a basin to wash her face. Her home will need renovation to meet proposed requirements for fire safety and separate electricity and water meters.",
      "Ching worries that upgraded homes will be too expensive for her.",
      "The government has said if necessary, it will offer assistance such as helping affected tenants to find other private accommodation or directly providing temporary shelter. A top official told the city\u2019s public broadcaster that transitional housing apartments are ready and assured that large-scale enforcement will happen only when proper resettlement arrangements are available.",
      "Chan Siu-ming, a professor at the City University of Hong Kong\u2019s social and behavioral sciences department, welcomed the government\u2019s taking steps to set minimum standards, but said its resettlement plans are inadequate.",
      "Chan said the impact could be wider than officials expect, and the city\u2019s supply of public and transitional housing may not meet needs. Low-income residents may also need help shouldering the cost of moving house, he said.",
      "As of last September, the average waiting time for a public flat is five and a half years, but it can take even longer than that. Ching said she's waited for eight years.",
      "In an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press, the government said it does not expect significant surges in rent as demand will drop with the increasing public housing supply. It reiterated that the rules will be implemented gradually to avoid causing panic.",
      "Chan added that some single people may be forced into even smaller dormitory-like \u201cbed spaces,\u201d which are not covered by the proposed rules. Bed spaces are widely considered to be Hong Kong's worst form of housing \u2014 partitioned areas in which residents get barely enough space to fit a single bed and some belongings. They are currently regulated under another law, the government said.",
      "Sze Lai-shan, the deputy director of the Society for Community Organization, a non-government organization, said some people have already been asked to move out of subdivided homes as landlords anticipate the policy.",
      "She suggested the government start registering substandard flats before the legislation comes into force to assess the residents\u2019 needs and consider expanding the eligibility for transitional housing. She also hoped the policy would eventually cover those living in tiny bed spaces.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain to people that Hong Kong has two sets of housing standards,\u201d she said.",
      "In Sham Shui Po, one of the city\u2019s poorest districts, bed space resident Law Chung Yu said he doubts that landlords will be able to comply with the rules.",
      "Law, who can\u2019t work due to a health problem and rents one layer of a bunk bed, pays around $280 in monthly rent for the bed space, about 30% of what he gets from the government subsidies he lives on. He shares a bathroom with neighbors in an apartment infested by lice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically an armchair strategy, I don\u2019t see it having much impact in reality,\u201d he said.",
      "Au's never measured her unit, and isn\u2019t sure if her unit meets the minimum size. But with her neighboring units falling short of the minimum size requirement, she knows her home would probably be gone too. She hopes the government will help resettle affected households into places that cost the same as their current rent.",
      "Her landlord hasn\u2019t discussed the issue with her yet. For now, all she can do is wait.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m taking it day by day. It\u2019d be worse if I think about it so much I develop mental problems,\u201d she said."

      "A Michigan judge is putting sponges in the hands of shoplifters, ordering them to wash cars in a Walmart parking lot when spring arrives.",
      "Judge Jeffrey Clothier hopes the unusual form of community service discourages people from stealing from Walmart and rewards shoppers who could see higher prices, or possibly lose stores, if thefts continue. The car washes will be free.",
      "\u201cI don't think everybody that steals is a bad person. Sometimes people are just down on their luck,\u201d said Clothier, who was recently elected to Genesee County District Court. \u201cBut there's going to be consequences when you break the law.\u201d",
      "Clothier told The Associated Press that he began ordering \u201cWalmart wash\u201d sentences this week for misdemeanor shoplifting at the store in Grand Blanc Township, 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Detroit. He believes 75 to 100 people eventually will be ordered to wash cars at weekend events at that location in March and April.",
      "The judge said Walmart is \u201con board\u201d and will provide water and supplies. The company's Arkansas headquarters didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Friday.",
      "Clothier said he was shocked to see the breadth of retail thefts when he joined the bench in January, adding that offenders were from all over Michigan and outside the state.",
      "\u201cIt's just crazy,\u201d he said, noting he had 48 such cases on his docket one day.",
      "\u201cI think it will be humiliating to be out there washing cars if you see someone you know,\u201d the judge said.",
      "And shoplifters won't be the only people up to their elbows in suds.",
      "\"I will be there washing cars with them,\" Clothier said."

      "During a time of pressure on public broadcasters, PBS says that it is shutting down its office of diversity, equity and inclusion and firing the two executives who staffed it",
      "NEW YORK -- PBS says it is shutting down its office of diversity, equity and inclusion to comply with President Donald Trump's executive order, firing the two executives brought on when the effort was begun in 2021.",
      "The move, eliminating the jobs held by Cecilia Loving and her associate Gina Leow, comes as public television and radio girds for a fight over federal funding likely to be more serious than it has faced in many years.",
      "Despite eliminating the DEI effort, PBS CEO Paula Kerger said Tuesday that \u201cwe were committed to telling the stories of all Americans before we had an office, and will continue to do it afterwards.\u201d",
      "Because PBS gets federal funding through U.S. Department of Education and National Science Foundation for its children's programming, the system's lawyers determined that it needed to comply with Trump's order, she said. The system gets some $535 million in general support from the government, about 16% of its budget, but because it is filtered through the private Corporation for Public Broadcasting, it's unclear whether that would require compliance.",
      "Some of PBS' 330 member stations have their own DEI efforts and receive CPB funding, so it will be up to them to decide what to do with their offices. \u201cWe're trying to encourage them to have lawyers look at their circumstances,\u201d Kerger told The Associated Press.",
      "The Free Press website reported that PBS initially considered transferring Loving and Leow to other jobs within the system. Kerger said that was thought about but rejected.",
      "The DEI office was concerned with more than just racial equity; much of its recent work went to making sure children with hearing issues had access to PBS programming, she said.",
      "Four years ago, PBS faced pressure from the opposite direction. More than 130 filmmakers sent a letter to the system saying that its relationship with documentarian Ken Burns came at the expense of others and that PBS showed a \u201csystemic failure to fulfill a mandate for a diversity of voices.\u201d",
      "With the Trump administration's current efforts at cutting federal spending, Kerger understands public broadcasting will be looked at closely. U.S. Sen. Mike Lee posted \u201clet's defund PBS and NPR\u201d on X Tuesday.",
      "That's not a new opinion. Republicans in the past have made similar calls, primarily because of a contention that news programming leans left. Ultimately, efforts to defund PBS usually fall short through pressure brought to bear on individual legislators from the hundreds of stations across the country.",
      "Kerger and NPR officials are expected to testify next month before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.",
      "\u201cI think it is different this time because so much is under scrutiny,\u201d Kerger said. \u201cI never assume that government funding will continue. I think we have to work hard each and every time these questions come up to make sure we are making the case of why this is important.\u201d",
      "She said it's a time where people assume \u201cthere is bias at play\u201d when they don't see their opinions expressed in news stories. Some people feel news efforts are too conservative, others too liberal. \u201cWe take that part of our work pretty seriously and if we miss sometime, we correct that,\u201d she said.",
      "Work done by local stations to alert citizens during the California wildfires and hurricanes in Florida are examples of things legislators need to be aware of, she said.",
      "\u201cI'm always an optimistic person,\u201d Kerger said, \u201cbut I think it's going to require a lot of conversations to see if we can hold on to a level of funding to enable our stations to continue.\"",

      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is on the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration",
      "BRUSSELS -- U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday made the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration, as the allies wait to learn how much military and financial support Washington intends to provide to Ukraine's government.",
      "Hegseth held talks with U.K. Defence Secretary John Healey, before a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Hegseth's predecessor, former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, set up the forum for drumming up arms and ammunition for Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Over nearly three years, around 50 countries have collectively provided Ukraine more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance. But the meeting this week was convened by another country for the first time: the United Kingdom. All previous gatherings of the forum were chaired by the United States.",
      "No decision has been made on who might chair the next meeting, if one is called.",
      "Hegseth wasn't expected to make any announcement on new weapons for Ukraine.",
      "His trip comes less than two weeks before the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Most U.S. allies fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin won't stop at Ukraine\u2019s borders if he wins, and that Europe\u2019s biggest land war in decades poses an existential threat to their security.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to quickly end the war. He\u2019s complained that it's costing American taxpayers too much money. He has suggested that Ukraine should pay for U.S. support with access to its rare earth minerals, energy and other resources.",
      "Some U.S. allies worry that a hasty deal might be clinched on terms that aren't favorable to Ukraine. On top of that, Trump appears to believe that European countries should take responsibility for Ukraine's security going forward.",
      "Washington's 31 NATO allies also want to hear what Trump's new administration has in store for the world\u2019s biggest security organization. Trump traumatized his European partners during his first term in office by threatening not to defend any member that doesn\u2019t meet NATO guidelines for military spending.",
      "NATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any ally must be considered an attack on them all and met with a collective response. Membership is considered to be the ultimate security guarantee, and it\u2019s one that Ukraine is trying to secure.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s security needs and defense spending will be discussed on Thursday. European allies have hiked their military budgets since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, and 23 are estimated to have reached or exceeded last year the target of spending 2% of gross domestic product.",
      "However, a third of members still haven't reached that threshold, and Trump is almost certain to target them again. Recently, Trump called for NATO members to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, a level that no member has reached so far \u2014 not even Poland, which is the closest, spending more than 4% and expected to approach 5% this year.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Germany on Tuesday, Hegseth wouldn't commit to having the U.S. increase its defense spending to 5% of GDP. Hegseth said that he believes that the U.S. should spend more than it did under the Biden administration and \u201cshould not go lower than 3 percent.\u201d",
      "He said any final decision would be up to Trump, but added that \u201cwe live in fiscally constrained times\u201d and need to be responsible with taxpayer money. The U.S. spends about 3.3% of GDP on defense.",
      "NATO leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their next planned summit, in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 24-26.",

    "summary": "Valentine's day and the whiff of chocolate and cocoa are in the air",
    "story": [
      "Valentine's day and the whiff of chocolate and cocoa are in the air",
      "BRUGES, Belgium -- St. Valentine chocolates always seek to show how deep your love is. This year, it might just also show how deep your pockets are.",
      "With the price of cocoa beans setting unprecedented records on the commodities market, it will certainly turn the gift of love into a bigger financial commitment than it once was. Turns out that if love is reputed to be eternal, a low price for cocoa, the essential ingredient in chocolate, is not.",
      "\u201cThe price increase of cocoa is absolutely spectacular, now for 2, 2\u00bd years,\u201d said Philippe de Sellier, the head of both Leonidas and Belgian chocolate federation Choprabisco. When it stood at less than $2,000 a ton in the summer of 2022, it really took over early last year and peaked at well over $12,000 during the Christmas season and has been hovering around the $10,000 mark since.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing unprecedented prices. They haven't been this high for the last 50 years,\u201d said Bart Van Besien, policy adviser of the Oxfam fair trade group. And the impact can be felt deep in chocolate gourmet country Belgium, where some of its 280 chocolate companies are left with a bleeding heart during Valentine's week.",
      "Dominque Persoone, owner of the famed Chocolate Line brand, still has plenty of beans to grind in his workshop in Bruges, but considers himself lucky, partly because he also has his own cocoa plantation in Mexico.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of colleagues who are really in trouble, because the price is too high,\" he said. \u201cIf you don't have good contacts, they just don't deliver anymore.\u201d",
      "Some just close for Valentine, he said, turning one of the few financial bonanzas of the year into a forced vacation, hoping that Easter, with its eggs and bunnies, will bring better tidings. Many chocolatiers can't go for the usual profit margins and turn all the extra costs of the cocoa prices over to their customers. Persoone said that his chocolates increased in price by 20% over the last year alone while de Selliers said that it depends very much from producer to producer.",
      "The shock of cocoa prices pretty much is a metaphorical perfect storm, mixing climate, disease, commodity speculation, the plight of farmers and social ascendency around the world into one heady mix.",
      "\u201cThe drop that has happened now in production was directly linked to climate change,\u201d said Van Besien, blaming changes in annual rain and drought patterns in western Africa that weakened the sensitive trees in key production areas. Persoone also said that the temperature differences between night and day increased in the small strip of land around the equator where the trees can thrive. Compounded by disease, it made sure too many harvests failed.",
      "At the same time across the world, populations lifted themselves out of poverty, middle classes expanded in places like China and the craving for the delicacy increased.",
      "And making matters worse, the years of slumping prices for the beans simply drove farmers off the land to look for a better future in the cities and pushed production further down. De Selliers said that \u201c60 % of cocoa comes from Ivory Coast and Ghana and these farmers have to make a better living. It is extremely important.\u201d",
      "Persoone concurred: \u201cWe didn't pay enough to have an honest price for the farmers.\u201d",
      "So, strangely enough, low prices then, help cause high prices now.",
      "\u201cThe big irony in the cocoa industry is that farmers are now getting a fair price at the moment they are abandoning cocoa farming,\u201d Van Besien said. \u201cWith the price they are getting right now, they could have invested in sustainable practices. They could have sent their children to school.\u201d",
      "Does it mean a premier box of chocolates is a guilty pleasure on Valentine's Day?",
      "\u201cYeah, the guilt question .... It's one that always works,\u201d said Van Besien, the fair trade expert. \u201cWe could not survive if we would be thinking about these things all the time,\u201d arguing that legislation should trump consumer emotions.",
      "\u201cWe should have laws that make buying cocoa below the cost of the production something illegal. And it should not be up to the consumer to make this decision,\u201d he said. Both de Selliers and Persoone hope that if the prices drop down again, they stay around the $5,000 or $6,000 mark.",
      "\u201cI really, really hope the money goes to the farmers,\u201d Persoone said.",
      "So in the meantime, despite the price hikes, the chocolate shouldn't leave too bitter a taste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a small luxury that most people still can afford,\u201d Persoone said. \"I hope it stays like this.\u201d",

      "North Carolina House members have advanced a Republican package to boost state recovery funding after Hurricane Helene by another $500 million",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina House members advanced Wednesday a Republican package to boost state recovery funding after Hurricane Helene as committees fleshed out details on how best to spend another $500 million to address the historic flooding.",
      "The House's budget-writing committee voted for the latest spending proposal, which would emphasize repairs for damaged homes, private bridges and roads, assistance to farmers who lost crops and rebuilding infrastructure adjacent used by small businesses.",
      "GOP House leaders had unveiled a version last week, but several amendments adjusted the measure in a special Helene recovery committee on Tuesday. A House floor vote is expected next week, said Rep. John Bell, the House rules chairman and co-chairman of the recovery committee.",
      "The package remains less than half of the $1.07 billion that new Democratic Gov. Josh Stein sought in new recovery spending earlier this month from legislators.",
      "Stein's package contains several initiatives the House plan currently lacks, including money to recompense local governments in the mountains for lost or spent revenues and for two business grant programs designed to help small businesses directly.",
      "Senate GOP leaders will have their own competing spending ideas that will figure into negotiations with House counterparts. Both Stein and Republican lawmakers want to get more Helene spending out the door early this year to address immediate needs. Additional funds are expected in the two-year state budget that would take effect July 1.",
      "The legislature already has appropriated close to $1 billion since last fall for Helene aid in the weeks after it made landfall in late September.",
      "\u201cThis is just the next step in this process,\u201d House Speaker Destin Hall told Tuesday's committee meeting. \"Somebody asked me earlier, \u2018How many bills are we going to need to do this?\u2019 And my answer is \u2014 and I know you all feel the same \u2014 it\u2019s going to be as many as it takes for us to get it done to rebuild western North Carolina.\u201d",
      "North Carolina state officials reported that Helene damaged 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads, bridges and culverts. State officials projected the storm caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs.",
      "Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "The state House proposal seeks to maximize federal matching funds, avoid mistakes from previous storm recovery efforts and prevent the distribution of too much money to programs ill-equipped to get it out the door, Bell said.",
      "\"This body is very strategic in what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Bell said Wednesday.",
      "Adjustments that House Republicans made this week to their preliminary bill included shifting $75 million to create a state Agriculture Department program to address agricultural crop and infrastructure losses.",
      "Another $60 million initially earmarked for repairs of state facilities would be used for other purposes. Nearly all of it \u2014 $55 million \u2014 would help small businesses, although not in the form of direct payments, as Stein and other Democrats want.",
      "Instead, the proposed infrastructure grant program would allocate money to local governments to repair \u201cqualifying infrastructure needs\u201d like utilities, broadband and sidewalks that would benefit small businesses trying to reemerge from the storm. Bell said Wednesday that a grant program could be open to abuses by businesses that aren't located specifically in the damaged region.",
      "With Republicans falling one seat short of retaining a veto-proof majority in the General Assembly after the November election, Stein and Democratic allies may be able to yield more leverage to fashion a package to their liking.",
      "For example, Democratic Rep. Eric Ager of Buncombe County offered an amendment Tuesday to create a direct payment program to small businesses that Stein sought, running it through the state Revenue Department.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re losing businesses in western North Carolina every day and we\u2019ve got to find a solution,\u201d Ager said, adding that it \u201cwould really go a long way in keeping some folks solvent through to the summer when business picks back up again.\u201d",
      "While Ager pulled his amendment before a vote because earlier committee action took away his funding source, Bell suggested to Ager and later to reporters that new language to help small businesses may be considered.",

      "In a video posted on X, Administrator Lee Zeldin said the EPA would revoke contracts for a still-emerging \u201cgreen bank\u201d that is set to fund tens of thousands of projects to fight climate change and promote environmental justice.",
      "The program, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, is formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, but is more commonly called the green bank. Two initiatives, worth $14 billion and $6 billion respectively, are intended to offer competitive grants to nonprofits, community development banks and other groups for projects with a focus on disadvantaged communities.",
      "The program is a favorite of Democrats who passed President Joe Biden's signature climate law without a single Republican vote, and former EPA Administrator Michael Regan frequently cited it as one of his major accomplishments.",
      "Republicans in Congress have called the green bank a \u201cslush fund\u201d and voiced concern over how the money will be used and whether there will be sufficient accountability and transparency. The Republican-controlled House approved a bill last year to repeal the green bank and other parts of Biden\u2019s climate agenda. The bill was blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate.",
      "Zeldin, in the video posted Wednesday night, said there will be \u201czero tolerance of any waste and abuse\u201d at the EPA under his administration. He cited \u201can extremely disturbing video\u201d on X that features a former EPA staffer stating that the Biden administration was \u201ctossing gold bars off the Titanic\u201d in order to spend billions of taxpayer dollars before President Donald Trump took office.",
      "\u201cThe days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cI\u2019ve directed my team to find your gold bars, and they found them. Now we will get them back inside of control of government as we pursue next steps.\"",
      "The video Zeldin cited was posted by Project Veritas, a right-wing organization that often uses hidden cameras to try to embarrass news outlets, labor organizations and Democratic officials. In this case, the Veritas video showed Brent Efron, a former EPA special adviser for implementation, speaking at a bar or restaurant with someone who turned out to be with the group. Efron has since left the EPA.",
      "Clean energy advocates denounced Zeldin's action as a political stunt and said he was illegally attempting to revoke spending approved by Congress for partisan reasons. They pledged to challenge the directive in court.",
      "\u201cThis is not just an attack on clean energy investments \u2014 it\u2019s a blatant violation of the Constitution,\" said Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, an environmental group that supports the green bank. \u201cThe Trump team is once again trying to illegally slash programs meant to help American families to fund tax cuts for billionaires.\u201d",
      "The money has already been awarded to eight nonprofits, including the Coalition for Green Capital, Climate United Fund, Power Forward Communities, Opportunity Finance Network, Inclusiv and the Justice Climate Fund. Those organizations have partnered with a range of groups, including Rewiring America, Habitat for Humanity and the Community Preservation Corporation.",

      "Breakfast sandwiches are the most popular order during morning visits, Circana said, and 70% of the breakfast sandwiches on U.S. menus include eggs.",
      "Eggs Up Grill CEO Ricky Richardson said breakfast restaurants took off after the COVID pandemic because people longed for comfort and connection. As inflation made food more expensive, customers saw breakfast and lunch as more affordable options for eating out, he said.",
      "The growth in restaurant demand reverses a pattern that emerged during the pandemic, when consumers tried to stock up on eggs for home use but restaurants needed fewer of them, according to Brian Earnest, a lead economist for animal proteins at CoBank.",
      "Changing preferences since then have caused further market strain. Americans are increasingly looking for protein with few added ingredients, and eggs fit that bill.",
      "\u201cConsumers think eggs are really fresh, so if you\u2019re making something with eggs, you know it\u2019s fresh,\u201d Earnest said.",
      "To address animal rights concerns, McDonald\u2019s and some other companies have switched to 100% cage-free eggs, which limits the sources they will buy from. Ten states, including California and Colorado, have passed laws restricting egg sales to products from cage-free environments.",
      "\u201cIt makes the market much more complicated than it was 20 years ago,\u201d Earnest said.",
      "The higher prices are hitting restaurants hard. Wholesale egg prices hit a national average of $7.34 per dozen last week, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That was 51% higher than at the beginning of the year. Wholesale costs may be higher than retail prices since grocers use eggs as a loss leader to get customers in the door.",
      "Some chains, like Waffle House, have added a surcharge to help offset the cost of eggs. Others may turn to egg substitutes like tapioca starch for some recipes or cut egg dishes from the menu, said Phil Kafarakis, the president and CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association.",
      "First Watch President and CEO Chris Tomasso said eggs are critical for the chain's brand and are found in the majority of its offerings, whether at the center of the plate or as an ingredient in batters. So far, he said, the company has been able to obtain the eggs it needs and isn't charging extra for them.",
      "First Watch is also increasing portion sizes for non-egg items like meat and potatoes, Tomasso said.",
      "Richardson, of Eggs Up Grill, said he recently met with franchisees to discuss adding a surcharge but they decided against it.",
      "\u201cEggs have always been and will continue to be an important part of American diets,\u201d Richardson said.",

      "English cricket has generated around $650 million from the sale of stakes in franchises in The Hundred to big-business investors from India and the United States, including consortiums involving NFL great Tom Brady and Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly.",
      "Auctions held over the past two weeks drew bids that value the eight teams in The Hundred \u2014 a format similar to Twenty20 and launched in England only in 2021 \u2014 at more than $1.2 billion.",
      "English cricket officials confirmed the huge figures for the first time on Thursday and set out how they want the money spent. The priority? Safeguarding the future of the domestic game that has lurched into financial strife in recent years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a seminal moment for cricket in England and Wales,\u201d said Richard Thompson, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board.",
      "The investors who secured stakes in the franchises range from Silicon Valley tech giants including Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, to four Indian conglomerates already owning teams in the widely popular Indian Premier League.",
      "Throw in the likes of Knighthead Capital Management, which includes Brady and already owns Birmingham City soccer club, and Cain International, a company co-funded by Boehly, and there's now a heavy dose of expertise in finance, technology and elite sport in a once-quaint sport that has been supercharged by money from around the world.",
      "It was 17 years ago when Allen Stanford, a Texan businessman, flew into Lord's \u2014 the so-called \u201chome of cricket\u201d in northwest London \u2014 aboard a private helicopter filled with fake dollar notes in a publicity stunt for a remarkable deal he reached with the ECB: A five-match T20 series between England and superstars from the Caribbean worth $100 million.",
      "The ECB were in raptures for a supposedly game-changing deal that quickly went wrong when Stanford was charged with \u2014 and later convicted of \u2014 fraud.",
      "So, has the ECB learnt its lessons after hitting the jackpot again?",
      "\u201cThis has probably been done in a different style \u2014 a bit more muted,\u201d ECB chief executive Richard Gould said on a video call. \u201cWe are very confident in the investor group we have got. ... We haven't been complacent.\u201d",
      "The ECB has done \u201cextensive due diligence\u201d and \u201call the checks to ensure it will be a different outcome\" to the Stanford debacle, director of business operations Vikram Banerjee said.",
      "The ECB seems open to that, yes.",
      "\u201cWe'd be foolish not to listen to the amazing set of investors that have got great ideas,\u201d Gould said. \u201cWe need to make sure we are a governing body that provides stability but also enables our investors and county clubs to drive forward.\u201d",
      "Gould made reference to the NFL taking games overseas and also the idea \u2014 floated around in 2008 but never adopted \u2014 of a 39th round of English Premier League games played abroad.",
      "No, the ECB insists.",
      "The governing body said it still owns The Hundred as a competition and felt it was important the \u201cstructure of the game is retained and owned by the ECB and our members (the counties).\u201d That means the schedule, the formats and the governance of English cricket.",
      "Expect, however, the new investors to make changes to their franchises when it comes to team names, colors and branding in The Hundred from 2026.",
      "Changing the times when matches are played \u2014 to potentially suit Indian audiences, for example \u2014 is \u201cnot on the agenda,\u201d Gould said, because securing strong attendances inside the stadiums is a priority.",
      "Banerjee said there was no intention to turn the Hundred \u2014 a format where each team receives a maximum of 100 balls \u2014 into a T20 competition but could envisage the competition having a second tier if there is enough growth.",
      "The ECB said the new investors have a \u201clock-in period\u201d of five years before they can sell their shares to other parties.",
      "The ECB said the deals, once finalized after an exclusivity period, will underpin \u201clong-term financial sustainability\u201d in the domestic game in England.",
      "Proceeds from the sales will be split 19 ways \u2014 between the 18 long-established county teams in the English and Welsh domestic game as well as the Marylebone Cricket Club, which owns Lord\u2019s and is regarded as the guardian of the laws of the game. The grassroots game is in line to receive around 50 million pounds ($62 million), the ECB said.",
      "\u201cOur three overarching principles as we look at what we want this investment to deliver should be strategic, ambitious and leaving a legacy,\u201d Thompson said in an open letter. \u201cWe may not get this chance again for at least a generation, and cannot afford to waste this golden opportunity.\u201d",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump says he&rsquo;ll sign an order that increases U.S. tariffs to the rates other countries charge on imports",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he\u2019ll sign an order that increases U.S. tariffs to the rates other countries charge on imports",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Thursday that he\u2019ll sign an order that increases U.S. tariffs to the rates other countries charge on imports.",
      "\u201cTODAY IS THE BIG ONE: RECIPROCAL TARIFFS!!!\u201d Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social. \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\u201d",
      "The prospect of a dramatic hike on tariffs could send shockwaves through the world economy, possibly depressing growth while also causing inflation to intensify. Trump has maintained that such tariffs will help to create domestic factory jobs, but most economists say they would effectively be a tax increase on U.S. consumers that would add to inflationary pressures.",
      "The Republican president has openly antagonized multiple U.S. trading partners over the past several weeks, levying tariff threats and inviting them to retaliate with import taxes of their own that could send the economy hurtling into a trade war.",
      "Trump has put an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports due that country's role in the production of the opioid fentanyl. He also has readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days. On top of that, on Monday, he removed the exemptions from his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs. And he's mused about new tariffs on computer chips and pharmaceutical drugs.",
      "The European Union, Canada and Mexico have countermeasures ready to inflict economic pain on the United States in response to Trump's actions, while China has already taken retaliatory steps with its own tariffs on U.S. energy, agricultural machinery and large-engine autos as well as an antitrust investigation of Google.",
      "Trump has not specified how he defines the term \u201creciprocal\u201d and whether his order would apply only to matching tariffs or to including other foreign taxes that he views as a barrier to exporting American goods.",
      "The White House has argued that charging the same import taxes as other countries do would improve the fairness of trade, potentially raising revenues for the U.S. government while also enabling negotiations that could eventually improve trade.",
      "But Trump is also making a political wager that voters can tolerate higher inflation levels. Price spikes in 2021 and 2022 severely weakened the popularity of then-President Joe Biden, with voters so frustrated by inflation eroding their buying power that they chose last year to put Trump back in the White House to address the problem. Inflation has risen since November's election, with the government reporting on Wednesday that the consumer price index is running at an annual rate of 3%.",
      "The Trump team has decried criticism of its tariffs even as it has acknowledged the likelihood of some financial pain. It says that the tariffs have to be weighed against the possible extension and expansion of Trump's 2017 tax cuts as well as efforts to curb regulations and force savings through the spending freezes and staff reductions in billionaire adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency initiative.",
      "But an obstacle for this approach might be the sequencing of the various policies and the possibilities of a wider trade conflict stifling investment and hiring amid the greater inflationary pressures.",
      "Analysts at the bank Wells Fargo said in a Thursday report that the tariffs would likely hurt growth this year, just as the extended tax cuts could help growth recover in 2026.",
      "\u201cTariffs impart a modest stagflationary shock to an economy,\" the report said. \u201cThe U.S. economy entered 2025 with a fair amount of momentum, but we look for real GDP growth to downshift a bit over the next few quarters as the price-boosting effects of tariffs erode growth in real income, thereby weighing on growth in real consumer spending.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The executive director of a federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico\u2019s finances says it is \u201cimpossible\u201d for the U.S. territory to pay the $8.5 billion bondholders are demanding in a bankruptcy case involving the island\u2019s power company",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- The executive director of a federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico\u2019s finances said that it is \u201cimpossible\u201d for the U.S. territory to pay the $8.5 billion bondholders are demanding in a bankruptcy case involving the island's power company.",
      "Robert Mujica Jr. unveiled a new fiscal plan for Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority on Tuesday, stating that the government can pay creditors $2.6 billion. The plan, requested by a federal judge overseeing the case, does not call for any rate increases to help pay off the company's debt of more than $9 billion and the projected expenses are higher than those in the previous fiscal plan.",
      "The board remains in contentious mediation with creditors as it tries to restructure the only outstanding debt that remains since Puerto Rico declared in 2015 that it could not afford to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load and then filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history two years later.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gone on for too long,\u201d Mujica said of the case. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to get out of this one.\u201d",
      "Economists have said that the unresolved case has spooked potential investors and hampered economic development on the island.",
      "Mujica noted that officials don\u2019t yet know where they would obtain funding for the $2.6 billion they\u2019re offering, but warned it shouldn\u2019t come from an increase in electric rates given already high power bills and the fragile state of Puerto Rico\u2019s grid.",
      "\u201cThe system needs investment,\u201d Mujica said, adding that all revenue should go into fortifying and improving the grid. \u201cPuerto Ricans deserve to have a utility that is performing and that is reliable.\u201d",
      "The island suffers from chronic power outages that worsened after Hurricane Maria razed the grid when it slammed into Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm in September 2017. However, the grid was already crumbling given a lack of maintenance and investment for decades.",
      "Mujica said that if the government agreed to bondholder demands, which total $12 billion including interest, it would mean an electric rate increase of up to eight cents that he says Puerto Ricans cannot afford.",
      "The current offering of $2.6 billion, which represents an 80% reduction of the power company\u2019s debt, has been accepted by 44% of creditors and a third of all bondholders.",
      "Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico, says the grid needs up to $25 billion in federal funding through fiscal year 2034 to fully rebuild and maintain the system.",
      "Of the $17 billion expected in funding from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, only $3.2 billion has been disbursed, Mujica said.",
      "\u201cThe system right now is deteriorating faster than the investments are being made,\u201d he said.",

      "Fontana was eventually disqualified, handing Santos-Griswold fourth place. But the American struggled after returning from China.",
      "Santos-Griswold opted not to go to that year\u2019s world championships and instead took some time out to decide whether to return to the sport.",
      "\u201cI was all over the place in my head,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say like about a month of myself going back and forth, like really figuring out if it was what I wanted, not like what someone else wanted, not what family wanted, and if I could handle the mental aspect of skating because it\u2019s really hard.",
      "\u201cUltimately I went back and forth for a while and decided that I didn\u2019t feel like I was ready to give it up. I felt like I still had more to give in the sport and I really wanted to push myself to the end.\u201d",
      "Santos-Griswold was speaking at the start of races this weekend in Milan that serve not only as the last leg of the Short Track World Tour \u2014 with her in pole position to win the Crystal Globe \u2014 but also as a test run for next year\u2019s Olympics, with some of the skating events set to be held at the same venue.",
      "\u201cDefinitely being here this weekend I think is really exciting and also nerve-wracking,\u201d Santos-Griswold said. \u201cYou want to obviously have a good feel and get a good mindset to be ready to be here in a year from now.",
      "\u201cBut I think regardless of what happens, it\u2019s also enough time to reset if needed. So my goal for this weekend is to really just get a good feel and prepare myself for next year.\u201d",
      "Having taken three Olympic trials to book her ticket to the Games, Santos-Griswold acknowledges that she felt the pressure in 2022.",
      "She feels there will be even more pressure next year but believes she is learning the lessons from Beijing.",
      "\u201cI think it was honestly a good precursor for this upcoming one and knowing how to handle that,\u201d Santos-Griswold said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that honestly I\u2019ve been dealing with a lot this year even, is the pressure of skating and how hard it can be and how frustrating it can be when you feel physically ready but mentally you might be not quite there.",
      "\u201cSo I think while it\u2019s hard to deal with right now, I\u2019m grateful that it\u2019s happening right now so that I can figure out ways around it and working with it.\u201d",
      "And there is one crucial aspect Santos-Griswold is focusing on.",
      "\u201cI think I always feel like I have to constantly prove myself in the sport,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m working on being confident in the type of skater I am and knowing that I don\u2019t need to prove to anyone that I\u2019m good.",
      "\u201cThat I\u2019m just good.\u201d",

      "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver had no idea 25 years ago that the Tech Summit would turn into much of anything, much less one of the hottest tickets at All-Star weekend",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- NBA Commissioner Adam Silver had no idea 25 years ago that the Tech Summit would turn into much of anything, much less one of the hottest tickets at All-Star weekend.",
      "Then again, nobody could have seen this coming.",
      "The NBA celebrated 25 years of tech summits on Friday, a full-circle moment of sorts. The event started when the league's All-Star weekend was most recently in the Bay Area in 2000 \u2014 and now, a quarter-century later, with this weekend's events in San Francisco the tech summit is back and still growing.",
      "The question at that first summit was a simple one: \"What's next?\" Turns out, nobody had the entire answer.",
      "\u201cOur first Tech Summit feels like a distant memory because there has been so much innovation around media and technology over the past 25 years,\u201d said Silver, who was president of NBA Entertainment when the tech summit was born. \u201cWe started the Tech Summit in San Francisco during the early days of the internet. At that time, there were skeptics, including many of the prominent leaders in sports media, who felt the \u2019World Wide Web' wouldn\u2019t become as transformational as some were forecasting.",
      "\"Of course, the internet went on to impact virtually every aspect of our lives and create enormous disruption in every industry, with sports being no exception.\u201d",
      "Among the speakers at the first summit: A tech star named Mark Cuban, who was about to take over as owner of the Dallas Mavericks. Many team owners have been part of the tech summit since; Golden State co-chairman and CEO Joe Lacob was one of the panelists at this year's event.",
      "\u201cI give the NBA credit for having the forethought,\u201d Cuban said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cAnd of course, back then, I said streaming would dominate.\u201d",
      "He was right: The first panel on Friday was a conversation between leaders from major streaming services \u2014 Netflix, Apple, Amazon and YouTube, along with ESPN and NBC Sports. The NBA releases a schedule and list of panelists for the summit, but to promote a robust exchange of ideas all attendees and participants agree that almost everything said during the event is off the record.",
      "Other panelists on Friday included National Basketball Players Association executive director Andre Iguodala, All-Star players Victor Wembanyama of San Antonio and Jalen Brunson of New York, WNBA champion Sabrina Ionescu of the New York Liberty, and USA Basketball chairperson Gen. Martin E. Dempsey \u2014 a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",
      "It was generally thought that the first Tech Summit was going to also be the last. The All-Star Game was in the Bay Area, a global tech capital, and it just made sense to talk about how the world was rapidly changing.",
      "But the event worked. So, it came back \u2014 and keeps coming back.",
      "It has grown into a very hot ticket, a who\u2019s-who of the NBA featuring team owners, billionaires from other walks of industry, media moguls and more. Silver said he\u2019s also enjoyed the 1-on-1 on-stage interviews that have highlighted past summits, such as conversations with NBA greats including Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan and Larry Bird. The conversation this year: broadcaster Bob Costas interviewing Golden State coach Steve Kerr.",
      "\u201cIt was something we had created uniquely for that moment in time in Silicon Valley,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAnd while the event has grown over the years, we\u2019ve also managed to keep it fairly intimate because the smaller size leads to more thoughtful and engaging conversations.\u201d",
      "Silver wouldn't have known what to guess when asked in 2000 what the conversations would be about in 2025.",
      "And when asked to predict what the topics at the Tech Summit in 2050 will be, he didn't know where to begin \u2014 because, of course, nobody knows what's coming in the next quarter-century.",
      "\u201cOther than the game of basketball, I really have no idea.\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe\u2019re featuring AI and robotics at this year\u2019s event. Who knew?\u201d",

      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Dale Earnhardt Jr. blinked back tears as the moment socked him at Daytona International Speedway \u2014 a track bursting with triumph and tragedy for his family \u2014 that he was, with a country star and a NASCAR champ in tow, back in the Daytona 500.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t believe that we get to race on Sunday,\u201d Earnhardt said. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it.\u201d",
      "Believe it, Junior.",
      "Long NASCAR's most popular driver as he built a Hall of Fame racing career in the intimidating shadow of his father, Earnhardt and his JR Motorsports team celebrated Thursday night at the track where he both won two Daytona 500s and suffered the loss of his father on the last lap in the 2001 race.",
      "\u201cDaddy loved Daytona,\u201d Earnhardt said. \u201cLoved winning here. Just loved to win any race here. He loved to add to that number whatever it was (34 total). Gosh, I loved coming here as a kid. Just a lot of great memories. So when he passed away, I had to make a decision, I had a career in front of me and I was coming back multiple times. I had to figure out a way to be OK with it.\"",
      "Earnhardt knew only joy and gratitude at the track as JR Motorsports and reigning Xfinity Series champion Justin Allgaier qualified for the season-opening \u201cGreat American Race\u201d and secured their Cup Series debut with their performance in a 150-mile qualifying race at Daytona.",
      "Earnhardt bearhugged and head-locked all his crewmembers, friends and family \u2014 that includes his race team partner, sister Kelley Earnhardt-Miller \u2014 as he climbed down the pit box and snaked his way to pit road. His lips quivering, hands shaking before the race, Earnhardt clutched Allgaier in pure bliss as the dream of moving up to the elite Cup Series level became a reality under the lights at Daytona.",
      "\u201cMan, we have kind of tried to downplay how badly we want to race in the Cup Series,\u201d Earnhardt said. \u201cAt least I have. It's one of those things where you're like, if it's meant to be, it's meant to be.\u201d",
      "Outside of two full seasons a decade ago, the 38-year-old Allgaier never made a serious run at a Cup career but found new life in NASCAR's second-tier series. He has 25 career wins and won his first Xfinity title last season. He finished second in 2020 and 2023 and blossomed into one of the most popular drivers during his 14 seasons on the Xfinity series.",
      "None of those accomplishments right now hit quite like racing in the Daytona 500 with Junior.",
      "\u201cThis one means more than I could ever imagine,\u201d Allgaier said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really fun.\u201d",
      "Added Earnhardt-Miller: \"In our DNA is to earn it, and that\u2019s how we were brought up with Dad. I think everything that we do, you put that hard work in, and it feels better to earn your success.\u201d",
      "Normally a beer drinker (Budweiser Select 55 is his favorite), Earnhardt might have to do cheers to his good fortune with some \"Tennessee Whiskey.\"",
      "JR Motorsports made a run at Daytona in large part because of a partnership with Grammy Award-winning artist Chris Stapleton. Allgaier, who has two previous Daytona 500 starts, and his No. 40 Chevrolet are sponsored by Stapleton's whiskey label, and the singer was expected to attend the Daytona 500. There's more star power inside the car, with the Chevy powered by a Hendrick Motorsports engine.",
      "Earnhardt was crushed after the race team \u2014 one of nine open teams trying to fill the final four spots in the Daytona field \u2014 failed to lock in a spot the previous night in qualifying.",
      "\u201cI didn't really know exactly how badly I wanted to do this or wanted to be a part of something like this until we started going through it,\u201d he said. \u201cYesterday was just so tough to understand, something as simple as being eight-thousandths too slow was really hard to understand. It's hard to accept. I've just been sitting here all day thinking about how badly I wanted this for all of us.\u201d",
      "Earnhardt won two Daytona 500s, in 2004 and 2014, and 26 races overall. But he never won a Cup championship or came close to matching the achievements of his late Hall of Fame father, Dale, who won seven titles and was known as \u201cThe Intimidator.\u201d",
      "It might have been easy for Earnhardt's professional successes through the decades at Daytona to get swallowed by the grief following his father's death",
      "\u201cI probably need a psychiatrist to describe it,\u201d he said to laughter.",
      "Candid as ever, the 50-year-old Earnhardt insisted he's learned to accept his dad's death as part of the long arc of life rather than grounds to forever blame and hate the famed track.",
      "\u201cI knew that it wasn't the track that took him. I knew that wherever he was, he still felt the same about Daytona,\" Earnhardt said. \"So, I've embraced it. Him losing his life in this property brought this property closer to me. That doesn't work the same with other people and tragedy, but for me, knowing I had to keep coming here, I made some peace with it, embraced the track and loved it.\u201d",
      "Earnhardt loves Daytona, too.",
      "As the tears flowed, it was conceivable to think Earnhardt might not have ever loved it more.",
      "\u201cWe get to push a car on the grid Sunday for the first time ever,\u201d Earnhardt said. \u201cIn the biggest, most important race that I\u2019ve ever known. And I can\u2019t wait.\u201d",

      "MEDLEY, Fla. -- Napheesa Collier of the WNBA's Minnesota Lynx took home $200,000 on Friday after she beat Washington Mystics forward Aaliyah Edwards in the final of Unrivaled's 1-on-1 tournament.",
      "The winner's check was the largest one-day prize in women's basketball history, Unrivaled commissioner Micky Lawler said, a big payday that was among the goals of Collier and fellow WNBA star Breanna Stewart when they founded the 3-on-3 league.",
      "Unrivaled gives WNBA players opportunities to compete in the United States and earn good salaries \u2014 an especially attractive option for players who for years suited up overseas in the offseason to supplement their income. Players earn an average salary of more than $220,000 during the eight-week season, which is close to the maximum base salary in the WNBA.",
      "\u201cMy entire WNBA salary is what I just got in 30 minutes of playing 1-on-1,\u201d Collier said. \u201cWhich is insane to even say. And same for (playing) overseas. A lot of people, this is their full contract, so you\u2019re playing seven months for this kind of money.\u201d",
      "Collier, a No. 1 seed in the 30-player tournament, won the best-of-three series 2-1 over the eighth-seeded Edwards to become Unrivaled's first 1-on-1 champion.",

      "Collier's five Unrivaled teammates each received $10,000 from the tournament's $350,000 prize pool. Edwards got $50,000 for reaching the final.",

      "The win capped a dominant tournament run for Collier, who plays for Unrivaled's Lunar Owls and leads Unrivaled in scoring at 29.3 points per game.",
      "Earlier Friday, Collier overwhelmed former UConn teammate and No. 6 seed Azura Stevens in their semifinal matchup. Collier scored the first eight points of the game and the reigning WNBA Defensive Player of the Year relied on stifling defense to win 11-2.",
      "Collier breezed past Katie Lou Samuelson in the first round before winning a physical second-round battle against Rickea Jackson. She then beat her Lynx and Lunar Owls teammate Courtney Williams to reach the semifinals.",
      "She shot her way past Edwards in the decisive Game 3, making 4 of 6 shots and holding Edwards scoreless.",
      "Edwards, who plays for Mist in Unrivaled, beat two top-seeded opponents on her way to the final, cruising past No. 1 seed Arike Ogunbowale 11-2 in the first semifinal matchup earlier Friday. Before that, she shut down No. 1 seed Stewart 12-0 in the opening round. After earning a second-round bye, Edwards topped third-seeded Allisha Gray 12-6.",

      "MONTREAL -- Fans in Montreal booed the U.S. national anthem prior to the Americans\u2019 first game of the 4 Nations Face-Off against Finland on Thursday night, and Stanley Cup-winning forward Matthew Tkachuk had a simple reaction.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t like it, and that\u2019s all I got,\" Tkachuk said after the U.S. beat Finland 6-1. Tkachuk and brother Brady each had two goals.",

      "\u201cOur goal is to make sure that we create an environment and that hockey represents an opportunity to bring people together, and I think people understand that,\u201d Commissioner Gary Bettman said Wednesday at a news conference prior to the start of the tournament. \u201cIn this building, initially there was some booing a couple of games ago and the club made an announcement asking people to stop and show respect for two great countries, and it stopped. And that\u2019s what we expect.\u201d",
      "U.S. center J.T. Miller put a positive spin on the song getting booed.",

      "There was no such reaction for Finland\u2019s national anthem that followed. Fans across Canada have booed the U.S. anthem at NHL and NBA games after President Donald Trump threatened tariffs against the country, prompting backlash from a close neighbor and longtime ally.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, obviously, and we wish it wasn\u2019t the case, but from time to time things happen, and people have strong feelings about it,\u201d Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said Wednesday. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re aware of what\u2019s been happening here. I think the negativity has probably lessened over the last week. Hopefully it continues to lessen and that relations will be normal. But it\u2019s something obviously we\u2019re aware of.\u201d",
      "U.S. captain Auston Matthews was booed during a pregame ceremony before Canada vs. Sweden on Wednesday and then again when he was shown on video screens during warmups. Matthews said after his team's morning skate that he expected that reaction.",
      "\u201cThey might just be booing us because we\u2019re the U.S. team here, like Auston\u2019s getting booed a ton and whatnot,\" defenseman Zach Werenski said. \"Obviously, I\u2019m a proud American and I love playing for the USA and being an American. I don\u2019t want to get into the political side of it, but it is what it is. I like to just view it as they want us to lose because we\u2019re the U.S. team.\u201d",

      "Davis Thompson has the lead at the Genesis Invitational thanks to a birdie on the final hole for a 66",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Davis Thompson capped a roller coaster of a back nine at Torrey Pines with a birdie to take the lead Friday in the Genesis Invitational. Scottie Scheffler had an unusually wild day off the tee and was right on his heels.",
      "It set up for a compelling weekend in this $20 million signature event with two names leaping off the pages of the leaderboard \u2014 Scheffler, playing bogey-free despite hitting only five fairways, and Rory McIlroy showing the form that led him to victory at Pebble Beach.",
      "Thompson made only two pars on the back nine and finished with a wedge to a foot for birdie and a 6-under 66 for a one-shot lead over Scheffler.",
      "\u201cWe're halfway through, still a lot of golf left,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cYeah, just trying to stay in my own lane.\u201d",
      "Scheffler, whose start to the year was delayed by a freak hand injury, appears to be gaining comfort in his game even if it didn't always look that way in far more agreeable weather along the Pacific bluffs.",
      "He twice hit off the 12th tee, the first one with a 50-yard chip shot back to the 11th green for a remarkable par save. His tee shot on the par-3 11th was so far left it twice bounced on the cart path, and it settled close enough to a water station that he got free relief.",
      "He had a shot right of a bunker that was right of the fourth fairway and had to flex his right leg to keep from falling into the sand. He managed another par there. On the seventh, another miss well to the left, he had to kick his right leg on the follow-through to muscle it out of rough that would even make the U.S. Open blush. That found the green for a simple par.",
      "He also holed a bunker shot for eagle on the par-5 sixth and converted three other birdies for a round of 67 that put him in the final group.",
      "\u201cI love see that,\u201d Scheffler said about his ability to score on day when his ball striking wasn't quite up to standard. \u201cI feel like those short little touchy shots are always the ones that are the last to come back after a longer layover. It's nice to get those feels back.\u201d",
      "He then headed to the range for a quick session with his driver.",
      "Thompson, who won for the first time last year at the John Deere Classic, was at 8-under 136 and will play in the final group Saturday with Scheffler.",
      "Denny McCarthy birdied the last hole for a 70 and will be paired with McIlroy.",
      "McIlroy surged up the leaderboard by going 5 under over his opening 10 holes until running into a few issues off the tee on holes where it's hard to recover. He rallied with a pair of birdies, but his lament was playing the par 5s with only one birdie.",
      "Even shot, his 67 left him only three shots behind.",
      "\u201cI hit a lot of really good shots. I played well for the most part. I scrambled well,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t take advantage of the par 5s. ... Look, I made up for it in other places, which was nice. But I know going into the weekend I\u2019m going to have to play the par 5s better.\u201d",
      "The signature events hosted by a player \u2014 Tiger Woods at the Genesis Invitational, though he is not playing this week \u2014 have a 36-hole cut of the top 50 and ties. Among those leaving early were Sepp Straka, who won in the California desert and was leading the FedEx Cup, and Jordan Spieth, who was coming off a tie for fourth in the Phoenix Open last week.",
      "Also missing the cut was Max Homa, who has not made it to the weekend in the three events he has played this year with a 36-hole cut.",
      "Scheffler wasn't the only player who leaned hard on his short game. Thompson got up-and-down for par on the 10th hole. He chipped in for birdie on the next two holes, regained the lead with a birdie on the par-5 13th, and then bogeyed the next two holes.",
      "But his 25-foot birdie putt on the par-3 16th got him back on track, and he had the advantage of being in the first cut on the 18th to help take some spin off a wedge he hit to tap-in range.",
      "Among those chasing is Ludvig Aberg, who was eager to get back to Torrey Pines. He shot 66 to get within four shots of the lead on a meaty course that he loves. Aberg got a nasty stomach virus he tried to play through three weeks ago, and it caused him to withdraw at Pebble Beach after the opening round.",
      "Aberg was at 140 with Patrick Rodgers, who had a 71.",

      "Aaron Rodgers\u2019 tenure with the New York Jets began with lots of fanfare and Super Bowl aspirations",
      "Aaron Rodgers' tenure with the New York Jets began with lots of fanfare and Super Bowl aspirations.",
      "It ended less than two years later with a disappointing thud.",
      "The Jets slammed the door on the 41-year-old quarterback potentially returning to the team when new head coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey issued a joint statement Thursday saying they told Rodgers last week \u201cthat our intention was to move in a different direction at quarterback.\u201d",
      "Rodgers will likely be designated a post-June 1 cut for salary cap reasons, but would be able to be released after the NFL's new league year begins on March 12.",
      "The four-time MVP hasn't announced his playing plans, saying several times in recent weeks that he'll take some time to consider whether he wants to continue his career for a 21st season or retire.",
      "While he faces an offseason of uncertainty, one thing is clear: If Rodgers wants to get back in the huddle, it won't be with the Jets. But a few quarterback-needy teams could be potential landing spots.",
      "They have the No. 1 overall pick in the draft in April and the Titans could target a quarterback such as Colorado's Shedeur Sanders or Miami's Cam Ward. Bringing in Rodgers could allow them to focus on other positions in the draft. But with a new general manager in place in Mike Borgonzi and a young head coach in 40-year-old Brian Callahan, would they want to take on an aging QB in what is a likely rebuild?",
      "Deshaun Watson might miss the entire 2025 season after he ruptured his Achilles tendon for the second time in three months, and his status with the team moving forward was already shaky. The Browns have the second overall pick, so they\u2019ll certainly have a shot at Sanders or Ward. But even if they draft one of them, Rodgers could allow them to sit and learn for at least a season.",
      "Daniel Jones is already long gone and Tommy DeVito is the only quarterback on the Giants\u2019 roster under contract for next season. New York has the No. 3 pick, so Sanders or Ward could be in play. But coach Brian Daboll and GM Joe Schoen don\u2019t have a lot of time to turn things around. They were retained after the season, but co-owner John Mara made it clear he needs to see marked improvement. Bringing in Rodgers would be a last-ditch effort to stabilize things. Plus, Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have to move and he\u2019s already familiar with MetLife Stadium.",
      "Sure, Rodgers' buddy Davante Adams insisted on leaving Las Vegas and reuniting with his former Green Bay quarterback in New York. But this is a new regime with head coach Pete Carroll and GM John Spytek. Aidan O'Connell and Gardner Minshew are the possible starters next season, especially since having the No. 6 pick likely takes the Raiders out of play for one of the top quarterbacks. But Carroll and minority owner Tom Brady could be an attractive combo for Rodgers, who would provide the Raiders with a bridge to a young QB.",
      "The Steelers have made the playoffs the last two seasons and four of the past five under coach Mike Tomlin, but failed to get out of the wild-card round in any. Owner Art Rooney II said it's unlikely both Russell Wilson and Justin Fields will be back, with his preference the Steelers choose one to return. Rodgers' availability might change things as he could step into a playoff-ready team that's looking for its first postseason win since 2016.",
      "Rodgers grew up in the Bay Area rooting for the 49ers and idolizing Joe Montana, and it appeared he could live out his childhood dream when San Francisco had the No. 1 overall pick in 2005. But the 49ers instead went with Alex Smith and Rodgers fell to 24th when the Packers drafted him. Brock Purdy is eligible for a contract extension on his rookie deal and owner Jed York recently said he'd like to see him in San Francisco long-term. But the 49ers missed the playoffs this season after playing in the Super Bowl and Rodgers could be viewed as the missing piece to another long postseason run.",
      "Could Rodgers take the same path Brett Favre did when he left Green Bay, played for the Jets and then went to Minnesota? Well, Sam Darnold could be a free agent after having a career year while leading the Vikings to the playoffs \u2014 although he could get the franchise tag. Jones is still there after leaving the Giants and so is J.J. McCarthy, who missed his entire rookie season with a knee injury. But Rodgers could step into a high-powered offense that includes Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, T.J. Hockenson and running back Aaron Jones, his former Packers teammate.",
      "New coach Kellen Moore was complimentary of Derek Carr in his introductory news conference Thursday, but stopped short of saying he\u2019d be New Orleans' starting quarterback next season. That certainly created some some speculation that perhaps the Saints could move on from Carr, who has two years left on his contract. Rodgers could step in for Carr, who was the Jets' backup plan when they pursued Rodgers in 2023.",

      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla -- Cease production of the penny, let collector\u2019s gobble up what's left of the 1 cent coin, and there will still be one eternally glued to Dale Earnhardt\u2019s old Chevrolet, the luckiest piece of loose change in NASCAR history.",
      "The penny was doomed into obscurity after President Donald Trump this week directed the Treasury Department to stop minting new ones, citing the rising cost of producing the coin.",
      "The memories that linger of Earnhardt, 24 years after his death in the 2001 Daytona 500, and of the penny given to him by a 6-year-old girl ahead of his 1998 Daytona 500 victory, are priceless to those who were there for one of NASCAR\u2019s seminal moments.",
      "\u201cI know,\u201d Earnhardt crew chief Larry McReynolds said this week, when asked if he heard of the penny\u2019s impending demise, \u201cthe \u201998 lucky penny.\u201d",
      "Lucky, indeed.",
      "At that point, Earnhardt, even with his seven NASCAR championships, was a victim of bad luck, missed opportunities and close calls that stamped him 0 for 19 in NASCAR\u2019s biggest race.",
      "Earnhardt was NASCAR\u2019s \u201cIntimidator,\u201d a nickname earned for a fierce driving style and a relentless pursuit of the checkered flag that fueled his Hall of Fame career.",
      "Winning the Daytona 500 was the only milestone that eluded Earnhardt over the first two decades of his career.",
      "Earnhardt had a number of fluky failures in the race. In 1997, with 10 laps to go and running near the front, he was involved in a late crash that sent his car flipping down on the backstretch. In 1993, Dale Jarrett passed him for the lead on the last lap. In 1991, he obliterated a seagull on the backstretch, damaging his radiator and forcing him to pit for repairs. In 1990, he cut a tire less than mile from the finish line, allowing Derrike Cope to steal one of his two career victories.",
      "Earnhardt long boasted one of the best teams in NASCAR driving for team owner Richard Childress.",
      "Who knew he needed a little girl and her penny to finally win Daytona?",
      "Earnhardt credited 6-year-old Wessa Miller for helping him get that elusive win. He met Miller through the Make-A-Wish Foundation following the final practice for the race. Miller gave Earnhardt the penny and told him she had rubbed it and that it would bring him good luck. As she handed it to him, he said he hoped so.",
      "Earnhardt brushed past McReynolds in the garage and started digging through his tool box and drawers looking for a weather-strip adhesive that was often used to glue lug nuts on the wheels. Earnhardt essentially traded his helmet for a hard hat and went to work sticking that penny on the dash of the No. 3.",
      "\u201cHe had enough glue to glue a dollar\u2019s worth of pennies on,\u201d McReynolds said. \u201cIt was running down the sleeve of his uniform. Finally I said, 'if I help you glue this penny on the dash, can we get down to business and talk about this race car?\u201d",
      "Whether it was the penny, the racing Gods finally on their side, or maybe Earnhardt was just that damn good, he finally won the Daytona 500.",
      "As Earnhardt crossed the finish line, the grandstands erupted in celebration. No one expected that emotion to carry onto pit road. As Earnhardt drove toward victory lane, crew members from nearly every team lined up to congratulate him.",
      "Now, 27 years later, the No. 3 Chevrolet is forever frozen as it was in victory lane, confetti and all \u2014 penny glued on the dash \u2014 at the RCR Museum in Welcome, North Carolina.",
      "\u201cI always enjoy going in there and seeing the mural of the victory lane photo behind it,\u201d McReynolds said.",
      "The win was a moment in NASCAR worth every penny \u2014 especially that last one.",

      "Meteorologists warn that the coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy and prolonged exclamation point on America\u2019s winter of repeated polar vortex invasions starting this weekend",
      "The coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy exclamation point on America's winter of repeated polar vortex invasions, meteorologists warn. And it will stay frozen there all next week.",
      "Different weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole not just into the United States, but also Europe, several meteorologists tell The Associated Press.",
      "This will be the 10th time this winter that the polar vortex \u2014 which keeps the coldest of Arctic air penned in at the top of the world \u2014 stretches like a rubber band to send some of that big chill south, said Judah Cohen, seasonal forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research. In a normal winter, it happens maybe two or three times.",
      "This winter, with record snow in New Orleans and drought and destructive wildfires in Southern California, has not been normal.",
      "The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains Saturday and then stick around all next week. The cold will likely concentrate east of the Rockies with only the far American west and central and southern Florida exempted, meteorologists said.",
      "On Tuesday, expect the Lower 48 states to have an average low of 16.6 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8.6 Celsius), and then plunge to 14 degrees (minus 10 Celsius) on Wednesday, calculated private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist.",
      "Sometime next week, 89% of the contiguous United States will be below the freezing mark and 27% of the Lower 48 will be below zero (minus 18 degrees Celsius), according to National Weather Service forecasts.",
      "Meteorologists expect strong winds to make the cold feel even worse. Every U.S. state but Hawaii, California and Florida have some or all parts forecast to have a good chance of windchills of 20 degrees or below sometime next week, the National Weather Service predicted.",
      "Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa will have \u201cprobably the most impressive\u201d cold, with temperatures as much as 35 degrees (19 degrees Celsius) below what's normal for this time of year, said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist at the weather service's Weather Prediction Center. NOAA weather models predict Wednesday lows below zero in Oklahoma, Colorado, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.",
      "Some storms \u2014 with flooding, heavy snow or even a nor'easter \u2014 could hit during next week's prolonged cold outbreak, but details on those aren't certain yet, Taylor said.",
      "\u201cEverything, all the stars align, all the wind directions in the atmosphere are dragging the cold polar air out of the Canadian Arctic,\u201d Maue said. \u201cIt\u2019s the depths of winter. Everything signals extreme biting, winter cold. Obviously this isn\u2019t the first polar vortex episode of the winter, but it looks to be the most severe.\u201d",
      "A stretched polar vortex like this one happens lower in the atmosphere and is different than when the polar vortex has sudden warming, weakens and all the cold air escapes south and out of the poles, Cohen said. During stretching events, the polar vortex remains in place and strong, but it also just pulls and bends. Stretch outbreaks are usually slightly milder than the big polar escape events and often hit the United States, not Europe.",
      "Meteorologists are going to want to study why this stretching is happening so often this year, but it could just be natural randomness, said Laura Ciasto, a meteorologist at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center who specializes in the polar vortex.",
      "\u201cWhat we're observing right now is interesting, but not unprecedented,\u201d said Martin Stendel, a scientist at the National Center for Climate Research in Denmark.",
      "Another factor adding to the polar vortex stretching is a big blob of high pressure in the upper atmosphere over Greenland. It's moving west and will push the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that moves weather systems such as storms \u2014 into a pattern that causes polar air to plunge and stay there, Cohen said.",
      "Human-caused climate change may be making the jet stream wavier and more likely to be stuck in that wavy pattern, one of the factors involved, Stendel said.",
      "There haven't been many winters like this in the past to help meteorologists forecast what will happen next and when the cold will finally go away, Maue said.",
      "Despite the unusually cold winter across the U.S., the world remains in an overall warming pattern. Earth's average overall temperature set yet another monthly heat record in January. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 C (2.7 F) above pre-industrial times.",

      "A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration passive acoustic recorder located about 900 miles (1,448 kilometers) away from the implosion site picked up the sound, U.S. Coast Guard officials said in a statement. The recording became public on Feb. 7.",

      "The implosion of the Titan killed all five people on board and set off a Coast Guard investigation and international debate about the future of private deep-sea travel. The Titan vanished on its way to the wreck of the Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean, setting off a five-day search that ended with authorities telling the world that the vessel had been destroyed with no survivors.",
      "Concerns were raised after the implosion because of the Titan's unconventional design and its creator's refusal to submit to independent safety checks. OceanGate, the Washington state-based company that owned the submersible, suspended operations in July 2023.",
      "Titan operator Stockton Rush, who co-founded OceanGate, was among those who died in the implosion. The implosion also killed two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet.",
      "A Coast Guard panel performing a lengthy investigation into the submersible disaster heard two weeks of testimony last September. The testimony included dramatic moments, such as when a former OceanGate scientific director said the Titan malfunctioned during a dive just a few days before its implosion.",
      "The Coast Guard is expected to release more information about the implosion in the future. A spokesperson for the agency said Wednesday the investigation is still ongoing and a final report will be released after it is completed."

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 The Italian government denied Wednesday that it had spied on journalists and migrant activists using spyware but said it would cooperate with an investigation into \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d after at least seven Italian cellphones were apparently hacked with military-grade surveillance technology.",
      "Meta\u2019s WhatsApp messaging service informed dozens of people across the European Union on Jan. 31 that they had been targeted in a spyware attack using technology from Israeli cyber firm Paragon Solutions.",
      "In a statement provided by Meta\u2019s Italy press office, WhatsApp said it had disrupted what it called \u201ca spyware campaign by Paragon that targeted several users, including journalists and members of civil society.\u201d",
      "After The Guardian newspaper reported the story, the Italian government confirmed on Feb. 5 that at least seven Italian cellphones were involved and that it had activated the National Cybersecurity Agency, which reports to the premier\u2019s office, to investigate.",
      "It said other targeted phones had numbers from Belgium, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.",

      "But he insisted that the law was \u201crigorously respected\u201d and denied the government had used the technology to spy on journalists illegally. He threatened legal action against any claims to the contrary.",
      "\u201cRegardless, it\u2019s up to judicial authorities to ascertain the source of the vulnerabilities that have been claimed,\u201d he said, adding that Italian intelligence services \u201care ready to provide full support.\u201d",

      "Both confirmed in interviews Wednesday that they had been informed by WhatsApp on Jan. 31 that their phones had been infected with the spyware. The message they received from WhatsApp suggested they contact Citizen Lab, based out of the Munk School at the University of Toronto, which has for years played a leading role in exposing state-backed hackers.",
      "Cancellato said he believed he had been targeted by hackers who wanted to see what investigative stories Fanpage was developing. He declined to speculate on who it might have been. Fanpage has published undercover reports in which journalists infiltrated the youth branch of Premier Giorgia Meloni's party and exposed neofascist behavior.",

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her government is not ruling out filing a civil lawsuit against Google if it maintains its stance of calling the stretch of sea between northeastern Mexico and the southeastern United States the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday that her government wouldn't rule out filing a civil lawsuit against Google if it maintains its stance of calling the stretch of sea between northeastern Mexico and the southeastern United States the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "The area, long named the Gulf of Mexico across the the world, has gained a geopolitical spotlight in recent weeks after President Donald Trump declared he would change the Gulf's name.",
      "Sheinbaum, in her morning press conference on Thursday, said the president's decree is restricted to the \u201ccontinental shelf of the United States\" because Mexico still controls much of the Gulf. \u201cWe have sovereignty over our continental shelf,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum said that despite the fact that her government sent a letter to Google saying that the company was \u201cwrong\u201d and that \u201cthe entire Gulf of Mexico cannot be called the Gulf of America,\" the company has insisted on maintaining the nomenclature.",
      "It was not immediately clear where such a suit would be filed.",
      "Google reported last month on its X account, formerly Twitter, that it maintains a \u201clong-standing practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.\u201d",
      "An Associated Press analysis shows that as of Thursday, the user's location and other data was dependent on how the Gulf appeared on Google Maps. If the user is in the United States, the body of water appeared as Gulf of America. If the user was physically in Mexico, it would appear as the Gulf of Mexico. In many other countries across the world it appears as \u201cGulf of Mexico (Gulf of America).\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum has repeatedly defended the name Gulf of Mexico, saying its use dates to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.",
      "She has also mentioned that, according to the constitution of Apatzing\u00e1n, the antecedent to Mexico\u2019s first constitution, the North American territory was previously identified as \u201cMexican America\u201d. Sheinbaum has used the example to poke fun at Trump and underscore the international implications of changing the Gulf's name.",
      "In that sense, Sheinbaum said on Thursday that the Mexican government would ask Google to make \u201cMexican America\u201d pop up on the map when searched.",
      "This is not the first time Mexicans and Americans have disagreed on the names of key geographic areas, such as the border river between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Tamaulipas. Mexico calls it Rio Bravo and for the United States it is the Rio Grande.",
      "This week, the White House barred AP reporters from several events, including some in the Oval Office, saying it was because of the news agency's policy on the name. AP is using \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d but also acknowledging Trump's renaming of it as well, to ensure that names of geographical features are recognizable around the world."

      "In addition to taking down scam networks, Meta says it is testing other tools to combat bad actors, including facial recognition technology that compares suspicious users' profile photos against a public figure's image. But, for now, that only works for celebrity impersonations.",
      "To stay vigilant, Meta recommend people be suspicious of messages from strangers. If you do engage, try to verify the person\u2019s identity by looking them up on the platform \u2014 check when their accounts were created or use a reverse image search on their photos.

      "Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.",
      "Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.",
      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",

      "The European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for more than 20 critical raw materials and concluded that if the country joins the 27-nation EU, it could strengthen the European economy.",
      "Details of any deal will likely develop in meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Zelenskyy and Trump will probably discuss the subject when they meet.",
      "U.S. companies have expressed interest, according to Ukrainian business officials. But striking a formal deal would likely require legislation, geological surveys and negotiation of specific terms.",

      "NEW YORK -- Google's online calendar has removed default references for a handful of holidays and cultural events \u2014 with users noticing that mentions of Pride and Black History Month, as well as other observances, no longer appear in their desktop and mobile applications.",
      "The omissions gained attention online over the last week, particularly around upcoming events that are no longer automatically listed. But Google says it made the change midway through last year.",
      "The California-based tech giant said it manually added \"a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries\u201d for several years, supplementing public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com that have been used to populate Google Calendar for over a decade. Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",
      "\u201cMaintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn\u2019t scalable or sustainable,\u201d Google said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.\u201d",
      "Google did not provide a full list of the cultural events it added prior to last year's change \u2014 and therefore no longer appear by default today.",
      "But social media users and product experts posting to online community boards have pointed to several holidays and cultural observances that they're not seeing anymore. In addition to the first days of Pride Month and Black History Month, that includes the start of Indigenous Peoples Month and Hispanic Heritage Month, as well as Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Verge first reported on some of these omissions last week.",
      "Norway-based Time and Date AS, which operates timeanddate.com, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. The website shows numerous country-by-country lists of holidays and observances from around the world \u2014 some of which include cultural awareness events like Pride and Black History Month \u2014 but those specific to public holidays are more limited.",
      "Separate from this Calendar shift, Google has also gained attention over its more recent decision to change the names of the Gulf of Mexico and Denali on Google Maps \u2014 following orders from President Donald Trump to rename the body of water bordering the U.S., Mexico and Cuba the Gulf of America, as well as revert the title of America\u2019s highest mountain peak back to Mt. McKinley.",
      "\u201cWe have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\u201d Google said last month.

Last week, Google outlined plans to scrap some of its diversity hiring targets \u2014 joining a growing list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Google's move notably came in the wake of an executive order aimed, in part, at pressuring government contractors to end DEI initiatives. As a federal contractor, Google said it was evaluating required changes.",

      "Two rare black wolves have been spotted on camera crossing a stream in a Polish forest",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Two rare black wolves, likely siblings, were spotted on camera crossing a stream in a Polish forest, a conservation organization said Sunday.",
      "The unusual sighting, captured last year on a video camera set up by SAVE Wildlife Conservation Fund Poland project coordinator Joanna Toczyd\u0142owska, has prompted the organization to collect scat (droppings) in the forest in the hopes of learning more about the black wolves' genetics.",
      "\u201cIt's something new and unusual,\u201d Toczyd\u0142owska told The Associated Press.",
      "Toczyd\u0142owska initially placed the camera to study beavers. When she noticed she was recording wolves instead, she kept the camera there and collected the black wolf footage a few weeks ago.",
      "In one clip, a black wolf and a gray wolf slowly crossed a stream in the forest, the water nearly up to their bellies, before they leap onto the bank. A second clip, taken last fall, records two black wolves and a gray wolf fording the same stream.",
      "Most of the 2,5000 to 3,000 wolves in Poland are gray with red or black accents. Black fur comes from a genetic mutation that was likely in domesticated dogs thousands of years ago. The dark fur is rare in Europe due to a reduced genetic diversity, but at least half of the wolf population has black fur in Yellowstone National Park in the United States.",
      "Because wolves travel in families and both black wolves were around 30 kilograms (66 lbs) \u2014 roughly the size of a German shepherd \u2014 Toczyd\u0142owska said they were likely siblings and roughly a year old. At least one is male.",
      "The conservation organization, which has been monitoring wolves in Poland for 13 years, is not disclosing the forest's location to keep the wolves safe from poaching and prevent misinformation about wolves from spreading.",
      "Wolves were essentially extinct in Poland by the 1950s, but the population has been reintroduced in recent years, especially in central part of the country in the early 2000s. Toczyd\u0142owska and her colleagues teach other the public how to safely live in areas inhabited by wolfpacks.",
      "\u201cFor people, it is a new phenomenon,\u201d Roman Gula, head of the organization's wolf monitoring project, told the AP. \"Education is one of our major, major goals.\"",
      "The conservation fund announced the sighting last week on Facebook and asked for financial support to pay for the scat's genetic testing to learn more about the black-fur mutation.",

      "PARIS -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a $97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman's push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company.",
      "\"We are not for sale,\u201d Altman said Tuesday at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.",
      "Musk\u2019s bid, announced Monday, is the latest in a bitter years-long battle with Altman over control of the AI startup they both helped found a decade ago as a nonprofit and is now a leading force in the global boom surrounding generative AI technology.",
      "\u201cOpenAI has a mission,\u201d Altman told France\u2019s AI minister in an on-stage discussion Tuesday mobbed by tech industry workers and investors. \u201cWe are an unusual organization and we have this mission of making AGI benefit all humanity. And we are here to do that.\u201d",
      "Its stated aim since its founding in 2015 is to safely build futuristic, better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk, an early investor and board member, quit OpenAI in 2018 after an internal power struggle left Altman in charge.",
      "Their public feud has escalated over the past year as Musk sued OpenAI and is working to grow his own AI company called xAI, part of a business empire that includes Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X. Musk also now holds power as a top adviser to President Donald Trump in reshaping the U.S. government, and has publicly questioned OpenAI\u2019s Trump-backed private investment project for building AI data centers in the United States.",
      "The offer complicates OpenAI's plan to shift its structure away from its nonprofit roots to a company beholden to shareholders.",
      "OpenAI's nonprofit board will need to consider Musk's offer. It's not Altman alone who can accept or reject it, though the chair of the board, Bret Taylor, echoed Altman's approach and declared \u201cOpenAI is not for sale\u201d at a Wall Street Journal event Tuesday in Palo Alto, California.",
      "Taylor said Musk's move was \u201clargely a distraction\u201d from the board's fiduciary duty to its mission.",
      "As a nonprofit board, said Taylor, \u201cour job is very simple, which is to basically evaluate every strategic decision of the organization through that one test, which is, \u2018Does this actually further the mission of ensuring AGI benefits humanity?\u2019 And I have a hard time seeing how this would.\u201d",
      "The board will need to weigh not just the value of the company's assets but also the value of controlling the company developing this technology. Musk's offer also seems to set a floor for how much the nonprofit should be paid if it does relinquish control of its subsidiaries.",
      "Rose Chan Loui, executive director for the Lowell Milken Center on Philanthropy and Nonprofits at UCLA Law, said the board should consider the credibility of Musk's offer, including if he and his investors will pay in cash. And they should consider whether a new board under the control of Musk and other investors would be independent and what guarantees they can give about protecting its public mission.",
      "Musk's $44 billion Twitter takeover in 2022 also started with an unsolicited offer and a legal fight with Twitter's board, which was also led by Taylor, a former Facebook and Salesforce executive. However, taking over OpenAI would be more complicated because of its charitable purpose.",
      "\u201cThere is a legally binding purpose,\u201d said Jill Horwitz, a professor at UCLA School of Law. \u201cIt is the promise that was made to the public when OpenAI, the nonprofit, was formed. That promise is legally enforceable.\u201d",
      "The sudden popularity of ChatGPT two years ago brought worldwide fame and new commercial possibilities to OpenAI and also heightened internal turmoil over the future of the organization and the advanced AI it was trying to develop. Its nonprofit board fired Altman in late 2023. He came back days later with a new board.",
      "OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit purpose, as defined most recently in 2020, is \u201c(to) ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity, including by conducting and/or funding artificial intelligence research.\u201d",
      "The question is, can it do that if it sells its assets and loses control of the company developing this technology?",
      "\u201cTo make the promise to the world that you are bound by a legal purpose and to build with that promise, including telling your investors not to expect any returns and to think of your investments as more akin to a donation than an investment,\" said Horwitz. \"And then to say once you\u2019ve gotten big enough, \u2019You know what? We\u2019d like to own this.' That seems like a real violation of the promise.\u201d",
      "Musk sued OpenAI last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab that would benefit the public good. A lawyer for Musk has said he invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018.",
      "Lawyers for OpenAI and Musk faced off in a California federal court last week as a judge weighed Musk\u2019s request for a court order that would block OpenAI's for-profit conversion.",
      "The judge hasn\u2019t yet ruled on Musk\u2019s request but in the courtroom said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn\u2019t intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its planned transition. But she also suggested Musk had plausible enough arguments to take to a jury trial.",
      "Along with Musk and xAI, others backing the bid announced Monday include Baron Capital Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund, and firms run by Musk allies Ari Emanuel and Jon Lonsdale.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement that if Altman and OpenAI\u2019s current board \u201care intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away from it: control over the most transformative technology of our time.\u201d",
      "Altman told employees this week that OpenAI's structure \u201censures that no individual can take control of OpenAI\u201d and he has sought to characterize Musk's tactics as those of a competitor trying to catch up.",

      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",

      "Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying numerous investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles",
      "WASHINGTON -- Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying a crushing number of federal investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles.",
      "Now, Musk\u2019s close relationship with President Donald Trump means many of those federal headaches could vanish within weeks or months.",
      "On the potential chopping block: crash investigations into Tesla\u2019s partially automated vehicles; a Justice Department criminal probe examining whether Musk and Tesla have overstated their cars\u2019 self-driving capabilities; and a government mandate to report crash data on vehicles using technology like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.",
      "The consequences of such actions could prove dire, say safety advocates who credit the federal investigations and recalls with saving lives.",
      "\u201cMusk wants to run the Department of Transportation,\u201d said Missy Cummings, a former senior safety adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the number of investigations that are underway with Tesla. They will all be gone.\u201d",
      "Within days of Trump taking office, the White House and Musk began waging an unbridled war against the federal government \u2014 freezing spending and programs while sacking a host of career employees, including prosecutors and government watchdogs typically shielded from such brazen dismissals without cause.",
      "The actions have sparked outcries from legal scholars who say the Trump administration\u2019s actions are without modern-day precedent and are already upending the balance of power in Washington.",
      "The Trump administration has not yet declared any actions that could benefit Tesla or Musk\u2019s other companies. However, snuffing out federal investigations or jettisoning safety initiatives would be an easier task than their assault on regulators and the bureaucracy.",
      "Investigations into companies like Tesla can be shut down overnight by the new leaders of agencies. And safety programs created through an agency order or initiative \u2014 not by laws passed by Congress or adopted through a formal regulatory process \u2014 can also be quickly dissolved by new leaders. Unlike many of the dismantling efforts that Trump and Musk have launched in recent weeks, stalling or killing such probes and programs would not be subject to legal challenges.",
      "As such, the temporal and fragile nature of the federal probes and safety programs make them easy targets for those seeking to weaken government oversight and upend long-established norms.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that\u2019s been stifling Tesla,\u201d said Daniel Ives, a veteran Wall Street technology and automobile industry analyst.",
      "Among Musk\u2019s businesses, the federal government\u2019s power over Tesla to investigate, order recalls, and mandate crash data reporting is perhaps the most wide-ranging. However, the ways the Trump administration could quickly ease up on Tesla also apply in some measure to other companies in Musk\u2019s sprawling business empire.",
      "A host of Musk's other businesses \u2014 such as his aerospace company SpaceX and his social media company X \u2014 are subjects of federal investigations.",
      "Musk\u2019s businesses are also intertwined with the federal government, pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX, for example, has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. Tesla, meanwhile, has received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.",
      "Musk, Tesla\u2019s billionaire CEO, has found himself in his newly influential position by enthusiastically backing Trump\u2019s third bid for the White House. He was the largest donor to the campaign, plunging more than $270 million of his vast fortune into Trump\u2019s political apparatus, most of it during the final months of the heated presidential race.",
      "Those donations and his efforts during the campaign \u2014 including the transformation of his social media platform X into a firehose of pro-Trump commentary \u2014 have been rewarded by Trump, who has tapped the entrepreneur to oversee efforts to slash government regulations and spending.",
      "As the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk operates out of an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where most White House staff work and from where he has launched his assault on the federal government. Musk\u2019s power under DOGE is being challenged in the courts.",
      "Even before Trump took office, there were signs that Musk\u2019s vast influence with the new administration was registering with the public \u2014 and paying dividends for Tesla.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock surged more than 60% by December. Since then, its stock price has dropped, but still remains 40% higher than it was before Trump's election.",
      "\u201cFor Musk,\u201d said Ives, the technology analyst, \u201cbetting on Trump is a poker move for the ages.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about how it would handle investigations and government oversight involving Tesla or other Musk companies. A spokesman for the transition team said last month that the White House would ensure that DOGE and \u201cthose involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines and conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "In the weeks before Trump took office on Jan. 20, the president-elect\u2019s transition team recommended changes that would benefit the billionaire and his car company, including scrapping the federal order requiring carmakers to report crash data involving self-driving and partially automated technology.",
      "The action would be a boon for Tesla, which has reported a vast majority of the crashes that triggered a series of investigations and recalls.",
      "The transition team also recommended shelving a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, something Musk has publicly called for.",
      "\u201cTake away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X as he campaigned and raised money for Trump in July.",
      "Auto industry experts say the move would have a nominal impact on Tesla \u2014 by far the largest electric vehicle maker in the U.S. \u2014 but have a potentially devastating impact on its competitors in the EV sector since they are still struggling to secure a foothold in the market.",
      "Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Before the election, he posted a message on X, saying he had never asked Trump \u201cfor any favors, nor has he offered me any.\u201d",
      "Although most of the changes that Musk might seek for Tesla could unfold quickly, there is one long-term goal that could impact the autonomous vehicle industry for decades to come.",
      "Though nearly 30 states have rules that specifically govern self-driving cars, the federal government has yet to craft such regulations.",
      "During a late October call with Tesla investors, as Musk was pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump\u2019s campaign, he signaled support for having the federal government create these rules.",
      "\u201cThere should be a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles,\u201d Musk said on the call. \u201cIf there\u2019s a department of government efficiency, I\u2019ll try to help make that happen.\u201d",
      "Musk leads that very organization.",
      "People whose lives have been forever changed by Tesla crashes fear that dangerous and fatal accidents may increase if the federal government\u2019s investigative and recall powers are restricted.",
      "They say they worry that the company may otherwise never be held accountable for its failures, like the one that took the life of 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon.",
      "The college student was on a date with her boyfriend, gazing at the stars on the side of a rural Florida road, when they were struck by an out-of-control Tesla driving on Autopilot \u2014 a system that allows Tesla cars to operate without driver input. The car had blown through a stop sign, a flashing light and five yellow warning signs, according to dashcam video and a police report.",
      "Benavides Leon died at the scene; her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, suffered injuries but survived. A federal investigation determined that Autopilot in Teslas at this time was faulty and needed repairs.",
      "\u201cWe, as a family, have never been the same,\u201d said Benavides Leon\u2019s sister, Neima. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer, and everything that we design and we build has to be by important codes and regulations. This technology cannot be an exception.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has to be investigated when it fails,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause it does fail.\u201d",
      "Tesla\u2019s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement on Twitter in December 2023, Tesla pointed to an earlier lawsuit the Benavides Leon's family had brought against the driver who struck the college student. He testified that despite using Autopilot, \u201cI was highly aware that it was still my responsibility to operate the vehicle safely.\u201d",
      "Tesla also said the driver \u201cwas pressing the accelerator to maintain 60 mph,\" an action that effectively overrode Autopilot, which would have otherwise restricted the speed to 45 mph on the rural route, something Benavides Leon's attorney disputes.",
      "The federal agency that has the most power over Tesla \u2014 and the entire automobile industry \u2014 is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation.",
      "NHTSA sets automobile safety standards that must be met before vehicles can enter the marketplace. It also has a quasi-law enforcement arm, the Office of Defects Investigation, which has the power to launch probes into crashes and seek recalls for safety defects.",
      "The agency has six pending investigations into Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology, prompted by dozens of crashes that took place when the computerized systems were in use.",
      "Other federal agencies are also investigating Musk and Tesla, and all of those probes could be sidelined by Musk-friendly officials:",
      "\u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department are separately investigating whether Musk and Tesla overstated the autonomous capabilities of their vehicles, creating dangerous situations in which drivers may over rely on the car\u2019s technology.",
      "\u2014The Justice Department is also probing whether Tesla misled customers about how far its electric vehicles can travel before needing a charge.",
      "\u2014The National Labor Relations Board is weighing 12 unfair labor practice allegations leveled by workers at Tesla plants.",
      "\u2014The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is asking a federal judge to force Tesla to enact reforms and pay compensatory and punitive damages and backpay to Black employees who say they were subjected to racist attacks. In a federal lawsuit, the agency has alleged that supervisors and other employees at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, California, routinely hurled racist insults at Black employees.",
      "Experts said most, if not all, of those investigations could be shut down, especially at the Justice Department where Trump has long shown a willingness to meddle in the department\u2019s affairs. The Trump administration has already ordered the firing of dozens of prosecutors who handled the criminal cases from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.",
      "\u201cDOJ is not going to be prosecuting Elon Musk,\u201d said Peter Zeidenberg, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Justice Department's public integrity section who served during the Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations. \u201cI\u2019d expect that any investigations that were ongoing will be ground to an abrupt end.\u201d",
      "Trump has also taken steps to gain control of the NLRB and EEOC. Last month, he fired Democratic members of the board and commission, breaking with decades of precedent. One member has sued, and two others are exploring legal options.",
      "Tesla and Musk have denied wrongdoing in all those investigations and are fighting the probes.",
      "The federal agency that appears to have enjoyed the most success in changing Tesla\u2019s behavior is NHTSA, an organization of about 750 staffers that has forced the company to hand over crash data and cooperate in its investigations and requested recalls.",
      "\u201cNHTSA has been a thorn in Musk\u2019s side for over the last decade, and he\u2019s grappled with almost every three-letter agency in the Beltway,\u201d said Ives, the Wall Street analyst who covers the technology sector and automobile industry. \u201cThat\u2019s all created what looks to be a really big soap opera in 2025.\u201d",
      "Musk has repeatedly blamed the federal government for impeding Tesla\u2019s progress and creating negative publicity with recalls of his cars after its self-driving technology malfunctions or crashes.",
      "\u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 should be recalled,\u201d Musk posted on Twitter (now X) in 2014. Two years ago, he posted, \u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!\u201d",
      "Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, said some investigations might continue under Trump, but a recall is less likely to happen if a defect is found.",
      "As with most car companies, Tesla\u2019s recalls have so far been voluntary. The threat of public hearings about a defect that precedes a NHTSA-ordered recall has generally prompted car companies to act on their own.",
      "That threat could be easily stripped away by the new NHTSA administrator, who will be a Trump appointee.",
      "\u201cIf there isn\u2019t a threat of recall, will Tesla do them?\u201d Brooks said. \u201cUnfortunately, this is where politics seeps in.\u201d",
      "Among the active NHTSA investigations, several are examining fundamental aspects of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driving systems that were in use when dozens of crashes occurred.",
      "An investigation of Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system started in October after Tesla reported four crashes to NHTSA in which the vehicles had trouble navigating through sun glare, fog and airborne dust. In one of the accidents, an Arizona woman was killed after stopping on a freeway to help someone involved in another crash.",
      "Under pressure from NHTSA, Tesla has twice recalled the \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d feature for software updates. The technology \u2014 the most advanced of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot systems \u2014 is supposed to allow drivers to travel from point to point with little human intervention. But repeated malfunctions led NHTSA to recently launch a new inquiry that includes a crash in July that killed a motorcyclist near Seattle.",
      "NHTSA announced its latest investigation in January into \u201cActually Smart Summon,\u201d a Tesla technology that allows drivers to remotely move a car, after the agency learned of four incidents from a driver and several media reports.",
      "The agency said that in each collision, the vehicles were using the system that Tesla pushed out in a September software update that was \u201cfailing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash.\u201d NHTSA also criticized Tesla for failing to notify the agency of those accidents.",
      "NHTSA is also conducting a probe into whether a 2023 recall of Autopilot, the most basic of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driver assistance systems, was effective.",
      "That recall was supposed to boost the number of controls and alerts to keep drivers engaged; it had been prompted by an earlier NHTSA investigation that identified hundreds of crashes involving Autopilot that resulted in scores of injuries and more than a dozen deaths.",
      "In a letter to Tesla in April, agency investigators noted that crashes involving Autopilot continue and that they could not observe a difference between warnings issued to drivers before or after the new software had been installed.",
      "Critics have said that Teslas don\u2019t have proper sensors to be fully self-driving. Nearly all other companies working on autonomous vehicles use radar and laser sensors in addition to cameras to see better in the dark or in poor visibility conditions. Tesla, on the other hand, relies only on cameras to spot hazards.",
      "Musk has said that human drivers rely on their eyesight, so autonomous cars should be able to also get by with just cameras. He has called technology that relies on radar and light detection to discern objects a \u201cfool\u2019s errand.\u201d",
      "Bryant Walker Smith, a Stanford Law School scholar and a leading automated driving expert, said Musk\u2019s contention that the federal government is holding him back is not accurate. The problem, Smith said, is that Tesla\u2019s autonomous vehicles cannot perform as advertised.",
      "\u201cBlaming the federal government for holding them back, it provides a convenient, if dubious, scapegoat for the lack of an actual automated driving system that works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Smith and other autonomous vehicle experts say Musk has felt pressure to provide Tesla shareholders with excuses for repeated delays in rolling out its futuristic cars. The financial stake is enormous, which Musk acknowledged during a 2022 interview. He said the development of a fully self-driving vehicle was \u201creally the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.\u201d",
      "The collisions from Tesla\u2019s malfunctioning technology on its vehicles have led not only to deaths but also catastrophic injuries that have forever altered people\u2019s lives.",
      "Attorneys representing people injured in Tesla crashes \u2014 or who represent surviving family members of those who died \u2014 say without NHTSA, the only other way to hold the car company accountable is through civil lawsuits.",
      "\u201cWhen government can\u2019t do it, then the civil justice system is left to pick up the slack,\u201d said Brett Schreiber, whose law firm is handling four Tesla cases.",
      "However, Schreiber and other lawyers say if the federal government\u2019s investigative powers don\u2019t remain intact, Tesla may also not be held accountable in court.",
      "In the pending wrongful death lawsuit that Neima Benavides Leon filed against Tesla after her sister\u2019s death, her attorney told a Miami district judge the lawsuit would have likely been dropped if NHTSA hadn\u2019t investigated and found defects with the Autopilot system.",
      "\u201cAll along we were hoping that the NHTSA investigation would produce what it did, in fact, end up producing, which is a finding of product defect and a recall,\u201d attorney Doug Eaton said during a March court hearing. \u201cAnd we had told you very early on in the case if NHTSA had not found that, we may very well drop the case. But they did, in fact, find this.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:06:26 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t work&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t last very long",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don\u2019t last very long",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Monday he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don't last very long. Instead he wants the government to exclusively move to plastic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous situation. We\u2019re going back to plastic straws,\u201d Trump said as he signed an executive order to reverse federal purchasing policies that encourage paper straws and restrict plastic ones. The order directs federal agencies to stop buying paper straws \u201cand otherwise ensure that paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings.\u201d",
      "The move by Trump \u2014 who has long railed against paper straws, and whose 2019 reelection campaign sold Trump-branded reusable plastic straws for $15 per pack of 10 \u2014 targets a Biden administration policy to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.",
      "Trump declared President Joe Biden\u2019s policy \u201cDEAD!\u201d in a social media post over the weekend.",
      "While plastic straws have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life, Trump said Monday that he thinks \"it's OK\u201d to continue using them. \u201cI don\u2019t think that plastic is going to affect the shark very much as they\u2019re eating, as they\u2019re munching their way through the ocean,'' he said at a White House announcement.",
      "Several U.S. states and cities have banned plastic straws, and some restaurants no longer automatically give them to customers. But plastic straws are only a small part of the problem. The environment is littered with single-use plastic food and beverage containers \u2014 water bottles, takeout containers, coffee lids, shopping bags and more.",
      "Around the world, the equivalent of one garbage truck of plastic enters the ocean every minute from a range of sources, including plastic bags, toothbrushes, bottles, food packaging and more, experts say. As those materials break down in the environment, microplastics are turning up in the stomachs of fish, birds and other animals, as well as in human blood and tissue.",
      "And plastic manufacturing releases planet-warming greenhouse gases and other dangerous pollutants. More than 90% of plastic products are derived from fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and millions of tons of plastic waste enter the world\u2019s oceans every year. Many multinational companies have moved away from plastic straws and have made reducing plastic use across their operations central to their sustainability goals, making Trump's decision an outlier in the business world.",
      "Trump\u2019s order is \u201cmore about messaging than finding solutions,\u2033 said Christy Leavitt, plastics campaign director for the environmental group Oceana, noting that most U.S. voters support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic packaging and foodware.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is moving in the wrong direction on single-use plastics,'' Leavitt said. \u201cThe world is facing a plastic pollution crisis, and we can no longer ignore one of the biggest environmental threats facing our oceans and our planet today.\u201d",
      "The plastic manufacturing industry applauded Trump's move.",
      "\u201cStraws are just the beginning,\u201d Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, said in a statement. \u201c\u2018Back to Plastic\u2019 is a movement we should all get behind.\u201d",
      "More than 390 million straws are used every day in the United States, mostly for 30 minutes or less, according to advocacy group Straws Turtle Island Restoration Network. Straws take at least 200 years to decompose and pose a threat to turtles and other wildlife as they degrade into microplastics, the group says.",
      "\"To prevent another sea turtle from becoming a victim to plastic, we must make personal lifestyle alterations to fight for these species,'' the group said in a statement.",
      "Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic. About 40% of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations.",
      "Globally, nations are creating a treaty to address plastic pollution. Leaders met for a week in South Korea late last year but didn\u2019t reach an agreement. Talks resume this year as more than 100 countries pursue a pact that limits plastic production as well as tackles cleanup and recycling.",
      "The U.S., China and Germany are the biggest players in the global plastics trade. U.S. manufacturers have asked Trump to remain at the negotiating table, and to revert to Biden\u2019s previous position that focused on redesigning plastic products, recycling and reuse.",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who presented the executive order to Trump, told him the push for paper straws has cost the government and private industry \u201can absolute ton of money and left consumers all over the country wildly dissatisfied with their straws. It really is something that affects ordinary Americans in their everyday lives.\"",

      "PARIS -- JD Vance is stepping onto the world stage for the first time as U.S. vice president this week, using a high-profile artificial intelligence summit in France and a gathering of national security leaders in Germany to showcase Donald Trump\u2019s more assertive approach to diplomacy.",
      "The 40-year-old vice president, who was just 18 months into his tenure as a senator before joining Trump\u2019s ticket, is expected, while in Paris, to push back on European efforts to tighten AI oversight while advocating for a more open, innovation-driven approach.",
      "The AI summit has drawn world leaders, top tech executives, and policymakers to discuss artificial intelligence\u2019s impact on global security, economics, and governance. High-profile attendees also include Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, signaling Beijing\u2019s deep interest in shaping global AI standards. The event highlights a growing divide between the European Union and other players pushing for more regulations to make the fast-moving technology safer for the public, and the U.S., where the Trump administration has prioritized business-friendly policies and technological dominance.",
      "Vance\u2019s trip extends beyond Paris. Later this week, he will travel to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, where he has said he plans to push European allies to step up their commitments to NATO and Ukraine.",
      "The summit will give some European leaders an introduction to Vance, who is making his first major overseas trip since taking office. He has signaled he will use the summit as a venue for candid discussions on AI policy and broader geopolitical issues.",
      "\u201cAt the AI Summit, the main reason I\u2019m going is actually to have some private conversations with the world leaders who are also going to be there,\u201d Vance told Breitbart News. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot that some of the leaders who are present at the AI summit could do to, frankly \u2014 bring the Russia-Ukraine conflict to a close, help us diplomatically there \u2014 and so we\u2019re going to be focused on those meetings in France.\u201d",
      "Vance is expected to meet separately on Tuesday on the sidelines of the summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, according to a person familiar with planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the yet to be formally announced bilateral meetings.",
      "Vance was joined by his wife Usha and their three children \u2014 Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel \u2014 for the trip to Europe. They were greeted in France on Monday morning by Manuel Valls, the minister for Overseas France, and the U.S. Embassy\u2019s charge d\u2019affaires, David McCawley.",
      "On Tuesday, Vance will have a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron, with discussions on Ukraine and the Middle East on the agenda. Vance, like the U.S. president, has questioned U.S. spending on Ukraine and the broader approach to isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump promised to end the fighting within six months of taking office.",
      "Vance also addressed what he views as a concerning trend in Europe regarding free speech, a topic he raised last year at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019ve seen in Europe a really significant, and I think, frankly, an evil trend towards censorship,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you hear a lot about America\u2019s moral leadership. One of the things that America\u2019s moral leadership is going to be about during President Trump\u2019s term is free speech. We want people to be able to speak their minds, and we believe that free and open debate is actually a good thing. Unfortunately, a lot of our European friends have gone the wrong direction there.\u201d",
      "Vance is attending Munich again, where he may meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He plans to revisit themes he raised last year, including \u201cto hit on\u201d the need for NATO allies to take on a greater share of responsibility.",
      "Leaders in Europe have been carefully watching Trump\u2019s recent statements on threats to impose tariffs on the European Union, take control of Greenland and his suggestion that Palestinians clear out of Gaza once the fighting in the Israel-Hamas conflict ends \u2014 an idea that\u2019s been flatly rejected by Arab allies.",
      "The summit, which gathers major players such as Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, aims at fostering AI advances in sectors like health, education, environment and culture.",
      "A global public-private partnership named \u201cCurrent AI\u201d will be launched to support large-scale initiatives that serve the general interest.",
      "The Paris summit \u201cis the first time we\u2019ll have had such a broad international discussion in one place on the future of AI,\u201d said Linda Griffin, vice president of public policy at Mozilla. \u201cI see it as a norm-setting moment.\u201d",
      "Nick Reiners, senior geotechnology analyst at Eurasia Group, noted an opportunity to shape AI governance in a new direction by \u201cmoving away from this concentration of power amongst a handful of private actors and building this public interest AI instead.\"",
      "However, it remains unclear if the United States will support such initiatives.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complicated questions to resolve\u201d around issues like the ability to control AI systems, Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, founder of Google\u2019s DeepMind research lab, said. \u201cBut also I think even more complicated are maybe the geopolitical questions about things like regulation.\u201d",
      "French organizers are also looking for the summit to ignite major investment announcements in Europe, positioning the region as a viable contender in an industry increasingly shaped by a growing U.S.-China rivalry.",
      "France plans to announce AI private investments worth a total of 109 billion euros ($113 billion) over the coming years, Macron said, presenting it as \u201cthe equivalent\u201d of Trump's Stargate AI data centers project.",
      "On the eve of the AI Summit, Macron posted a series of 'deepfake' videos of himself on Instagram, using artificial intelligence to manipulate his voice and image in various parodies\u2014an effort he said was meant to spark debate on AI\u2019s potential and risks.",
      "In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun expressed opposition Monday to any moves to restrict access to AI tools. The release of DeepSeek has prompted calls in the U.S. Congress to limit its use for security reasons.",
      "\u201cWe oppose drawing ideological lines and oppose overstretching national security concepts and politicizing economic and trade issues,\u201d Guo said.",
      "He said that China advocates for open-source AI technology and promotes the accessibility of AI services to share the benefits of artificial intelligence with all countries.",
      "Modi is co-hosting the summit with Macron in an effort to involve more global actors in AI development and prevent the sector from becoming a U.S.-China battle.",
      "India\u2019s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, stressed the need for equitable access to AI to avoid \"perpetuating a digital divide that is already existing across the world.\u201d",
      "Macron will also travel on Wednesday with Modi to the southern French port city of Marseille to inaugurate an Indian Consulate there and visit the ITER nuclear research site.",
      "France has become a key defense partner for India, with talks underway on New Delhi purchasing 26 Rafale fighter jets and three Scorpene submarines. Officials in India said that discussions are at the final phase and the deal could be inked in a few weeks.",

      "She suggested her decision would come down over the next few days, but not on Friday night.",
      "The 19 states brought the lawsuit against Musk and the administration, arguing that allowing Musk's associates to access the Treasury Department's payment system as part of Trump's campaign pledge to slash the federal government would be a \"huge cybersecurity risk\" and potentially allow the Trump administration to unlawfully \"block federal funds from reaching beneficiaries who do not align with the President's political agenda.\"",
      "\"All of the States' residents whose [personal identifiable information] and sensitive financial information is stored in the payment files that reside within the payment systems are at risk of having that information compromised and used against them,\" the lawsuit said.",

      "The lawsuit -- filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James and 18 other state attorneys general -- raised particular concern about unvetted DOGE employees accessing sensitive government records including social security numbers, bank information, and federal tax returns. According to the lawsuit, Musk being able to access the Bureau of Fiscal Services -- which serves as the country's checkbook by dispersing trillions in funding -- could allow Musk to cut off government spending from the source.",

      "\"The Court's firm assessment is that, for the reasons stated by the States, they will face irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief. That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking,\" U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer wrote, prompting a Mush to blast the judge and Vice President JD Vance to question the legality of the order.",
      "While the Trump administration challenged the temporary order, U.S. District Judge Jeanette Vargas -- a Biden-nominated judge who will hear the case going forward -- reiterated that there was \"sound factual basis\" for the temporary restraining order when it was imposed late last week.",

But now, the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage is being actively targeted by some conservative lawmakers. The Idaho House passed a resolution in late January by a vote of 46-24 calling on the Supreme Court to reconsider its past marriage equality decision.",
      "The Idaho resolution comes after Associate Justice Clarence Thomas expressed interest in revisiting the Obergefell v. Hodges same-sex marriage decision, should a future related court case arise, in his concurring opinion on the court's landmark 2022 decision on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned the federal right to abortion. He argued that any past \"substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous'\" and would need to be corrected, specifically noting Obergefell.",
      "Some legislators and residents in Idaho, Arizona, Virginia, and Nebraska are addressing the current legislative climate by looking for ways to stop anti-same-sex marriage efforts in their tracks \u2013 and they hope to do so by letting voters decide on marriage equality for themselves at the ballot box.",

      "Federal funds from the Department of Education support programs, resources and sometimes even staffing to address educational barriers faced by low-income, low-performing, disabled and rural students, among others.",
      "If the department is dismantled, as President Donald Trump and some Republican lawmakers have said they hope to do, public school K-12 educators fear these programs could be diminished.",
      "\"The first people that are going to feel that are second- and third-graders who are getting specific reading interventions that will help them be closer to grade level. I have high schoolers who are reading well below a ninth-grade level, and that would only get worse,\" Stambaugh said. \"And then to wonder to yourself will this child be able to read a medical document to sign? Will this child be able to conduct just the general business of life? Because at the bare minimum, that's what schools are offering.\"",
      "Detroit high school teacher Rodney Fresh said he's seen students that might have been considered \"a throwaway child by society \u2026 become a productive member of society when they graduate\" because of the Michigan school's career and technical programs, which get federal funding.",
      "\"I've seen students where traditional schooling hasn't necessarily been beneficial, but we get them in supportive career tech programs that are supported by federal finances, and they excel. They find their niche,\" Fresh told ABC News.",
      "Established in 1980 by Congress, the department is intended to collect data and research on schooling and education, direct supportive funds to targeted communities, and investigate and enforce civil rights anti-discrimination law. It's the smallest Cabinet-level department, with less than 5,000 employees.",
      "The department does not dictate or implement policy on school curriculum.",
      "President Trump said he wants to eliminate the department and \"send all education work and needs back to the States,\" according to Trump's Agenda47 campaign.",
      "Trump's team hasn't clarified what it would mean to give the power back to the states, though he has cited the use of \"block grants\" by the federal government as a way to further expand school voucher programs.",
      "In the ongoing efforts to dismantle the Department of Education, lawmakers have recommended redirecting program enforcement and funds to other federal departments.",
      "\"The federal Department of Education has never educated a single student, and it's long past time to end this bureaucratic Department that causes more harm than good,\" U.S. Senator Mike Rounds said when introducing legislation to dismantle the department.",
      "A statement from his office continued, stating: \"Despite its inefficiencies, there are several important programs housed within the Department. Rounds' legislation would redirect these to Departments of Interior, Treasury, Health and Human Services, Labor and State.\"",
      "ABC News has reached out to the White House and the Department of Education for comment.",
      "\"Many of the concerns that people have with education and the direction of education this country, whether it be curriculum, instruction or even instructional materials, are not handled by the Department of Education,\" Rep. Jahana Hayes, a Democrat on the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, said in an interview with ABC News.",
      "\"Those are already local decisions that are handled by local boards of education, state boards of education. So all of that is handled locally.\"",
      "Federal funding makes up 11% of school revenue nationwide, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.",
      "However, the weight this funding carries is heavier for some states than others; federal dollars make up roughly 20% of South Dakota school revenue and 19% of revenue in Mississippi and Montana. These are the biggest recipients of federal dollars in the country, the NCES noted.",
      "States like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are among the smallest recipients, with federal dollars making up just 5% of school revenue.",
      "Among the grants and funds delivered by the department are Title I funding and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funding. These federal financial assistance programs are geared towards communities facing high levels of poverty or disabled populations. They can support services like additional reading and mathematics instruction and staffing, speech or behavioral therapy, after-school and summer programs.",
      "Across Ohio, the state's Coalition for the Education of Children with Disabilities reports that almost 16% of students have a disability of some kind.",
      "Stambaugh said she sees the role that federal funding plays for the disabled students in her classrooms each day. She noted the money subsidizes the salaries or pay for tutors, individual aids for highly disabled children and intervention specialists aimed at helping struggling readers and performers.",
      "Getting rid of federal funding, Stambaugh argued, \"gives our highest vulnerability students less one-on-one attention, less individualized education, and it puts them at greater risk to be even further behind the peers that they're already testing behind.\"",
      "In Detroit, where about 84% of kids are eligible for free and/or reduced-price lunch, schools have become more than a place for students to learn.",
      "For those who come to school hungry, need a place to wash and dry their clothes, or need additional help with literacy and math after class, federal funding helps schools run additional services for students in need, according to Fresh.",
      "\"For some students, I become a counselor, a social worker, a big brother, a dad, and so I don't think you ever really get to just turn off from being a teacher,\" said Fresh. \"I think it's a 24/7 job.\"",
      "Title I and IDEA were established through Congress, just as the Department of Education was, and it would take Congress to lead their undoing, some lawmakers told ABC News.",
      "Hayes told ABC News that she expects Trump and billionaire businessman and Trump confidant Elon Musk to \"strangle the funding\" of the department if it can't be dismantled.",
      "\"What we're seeing through some of the actions with other organizations is that we are dealing with an administration that is not following the rules as they've been established,\" Hayes said. \"The Department of Education was set up by an act of Congress, and can only be dismantled by an act of Congress.\"",
      "Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has already made sizable cuts to the Education Department \u2013 slashing 89 independent research contracts at the department's Institute of Education Sciences worth nearly $900 million, according to DOGE's post on X and confirmed by a department spokesperson on Feb. 11.",
      "But with the thin Republican majority in the House and Senate, it's unclear just how likely it would be for Congress to dismantle the department completely.",
      "Utah Republican Rep. Burgess Owens told ABC News it'll be a congressional numbers game to take down the Education Department, but noted that he has to \"see if executive order can really do that or not.\"",
      "\"All the things will be tested,\" he said.",
      "Owens, who supports dismantling the department, said that issuing block grants to states could serve as a replacement for the department's programs, adding that there would have to be some state accountability for funds.",
      "\"If this is not working, let's be innovative. Let's be creative, and we figure out something else,\" he said.",

      "No longer in charge, Sen. Mitch McConnell has been speaking his mind",
      "WASHINGTON -- No longer in charge, Sen. Mitch McConnell has been speaking his mind, the long-serving GOP leader rejecting President Donald Trump\u2019s more high-profile Cabinet nominees \u2014 alone at times, among the Republicans, casting his no votes.",
      "When it came to Pete Hegseth, now the defense secretary, who faced allegations of excessive drinking and aggressive behavior toward women, McConnell said the combat veteran had \u201cfailed, as yet, to demonstrate\u201d he was ready for the job.",
      "The \u201cdesire to be a change agent is not enough,\u201d McConnell said.",
      "On Tulsi Gabbard, who was sworn in this week as director of national intelligence, he said she has displayed \u201ca history of alarming lapses in judgment,\u201d citing in particular her views toward Russia, China and the security breach by former government contractor Edward Snowden.",
      "And as Senate Republicans confirmed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, McConnell, a survivor of childhood polio  who used a wheelchair during the vote, opposed.",
      "\u201cA record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions does not entitle Mr. Kennedy to lead these important efforts,\u201d the Kentucky senator said.",
      "This is McConnell unplugged, three weeks into the Trump administration, and his new role as no longer the Senate GOP leader but one of 100 senators. It is testing the strength, but also the limits, of his influence on the institution, where he has been a monumental presence for nearly 40 years.",
      "McConnell is far from an anti-Trump Republican and hardly the face of the GOP opposition to the White House. He has voted to confirm Trump\u2019s other nominees and said he expects to support Trump's agenda.",
      "But his opposition to the trio of Trump's most controversial nominees stands out. Taken together, McConnell's votes against Hegseth, Gabbard and RFK Jr. provide a window into the type of leader he intends to be outside the stately leadership office. And it shows the shifts in his power, as few other Republicans joined him, leaving him often on his own, with Democrats, unable to stop Trump's choices.",
      "\u201cMcConnell\u2019s votes on the Trump nominees reflect, at least in part, the fact that he is more free to vote in accord with personal preferences than he was when he was responsible for serving as the leader and voice for Senate Republicans,\u201d said Frances Lee, a professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton.",
      "Just two other Republicans, the independent-minded Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, also voted against Hegseth.",
      "\u201cNow that he is no longer in leadership, Sen. McConnell enjoys more freedom to simply exercise his own individual judgment and personal discretion,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Trump lashed out after the latest votes, calling McConnell \u201cbitter\u201d and \u201cnot equipped mentally\u201d during a lengthy rant in the Oval Office late Thursday, after Kennedy was sworn into office.",
      "\u201cI feel sorry for Mitch,\u201d the Republican president said.",
      "\u201cHe votes against almost everything now. He\u2019s a, you know, very bitter guy,\u201d Trump said of McConnell, who had been a crucial partner as the Senate majority leader during Trump's first term.",
      "Together, Trump and McConnell passed shared priorities, notably the 2017 GOP tax bill, but the two also clashed \u2014 the president calling the senator \u201cOld Crow,\u201d which McConnell turned into a badge of honor \u2014 and had a very public falling out after the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden. McConnell called Trump \u201cmorally responsible\u201d for the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection by a mob of his supporters at the Capitol but ultimately endorsed Trump's reelection bid.",
      "Trump did not appear Thursday to understand that McConnell had polio as a child, a factor as he weighed Kennedy's nomination.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s lost his power,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things.\u201d",
      "When he announced he was stepping down as GOP leader, McConnell said he would finish his Senate term, which expires after the 2026 election. It\u2019s unclear if he will run again.",
      "To be sure, McConnell is far from marginalized. He commands prime positions as chairman of the influential Rules Committee as well as the chairman of the Appropriation Committee\u2019s subcommittee on defense, where he has signaled he intends to make his mark shoring up the nation\u2019s military assets and assuring U.S. leadership on the global stage.",
      "\u201cI expect to support most of what this administration is trying to accomplish,\u201d McConnell said during a recent interview on CBS' \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d",
      "The senator still faces polio\u2019s lingering effects, particularly in his left leg. McConnell fell twice recently, on the steps from the Senate chamber, where he was swiftly caught and steadied by two GOP colleagues, and a short time later in the private GOP lunchroom. He sometimes uses a wheelchair as he did this week as a precaution.",
      "Other senators are watching and weighing the turn of events.",
      "\u201cHe seems to be liberated, and I think he\u2019s voting his conscience,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat.",
      "Blumenthal said while other Republicans are \u201cin a state of trembling in fear\u201d over primary threats if they don\u2019t fall in line with Trump\u2019s agenda, particularly from billionaire Trump aide Elon Musk\u2019s political group, McConnell is not among them.",
      "\u201cWhatever his motivation, he is certainly demonstrating that courage and conscience still matter,\u201d he said.",
      "New Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, said, \u201cThe great part about being a senator is that you get to decide what\u2019s important to you, what your priorities are, and he should represent the people who elected him.\u201d",
      "McConnell\u2019s critics have also taken notice. Nate Morris, a businessman in Kentucky, said this week he is considering a Senate run in 2026.",
      "\u201cI think President Trump needs less of these weak, career politicians running for office and more outside businessmen who are going to fight for his America First agenda,\u201d Morris posted on social media this week.",
      "Citing McConnell\u2019s opposition to Hegseth, Morris said McConnell \"turned his back on President Trump.\u201d",

      "\u201cPeople wanted that very badly,\u201d Trump said.",
      "In a fact sheet provided to reporters, the White House said the order was necessary because COVID vaccine mandates were \"threatening educational opportunities for students.\"",

      "Thank you so much for your time, Mr. Huitema. So, the office you worked in is an independent agency that was working to prevent conflicts of interest in government. Have those guardrails now simply been removed?",
      "HUITEMA: Well, I know that there are committed public servants still at the Office of Government Ethics and ethics officials throughout the executive branch who are committed to their work and committed to upholding those values of integrity.",
      "But certainly those guardrails have been weakened. There is a real change in vision; I would say, from having organizations -- like the inspectors general, the Office of Special Counsel, the Office of Government Ethics -- that have an air of independence and authority and stature to speak without an agenda, you know, play it straight and narrow and uphold integrity, uphold the rule of law and and uphold accountability in government.",
      "ABC NEWS: So should the American public be confident executive branch nominees are not violating ethics rules and are complying with the law?",
      "HUITEMA: Well, we'll have to see. You know, it's interesting -- I was caught by surprise, obviously, by my termination. And my biggest feeling is one of disappointment. I had signed up for a five-year commitment and I was committed to seeing that through.",
      "And I knew that that meant working across multiple administrations and I was willing to serve in good faith any administration, including this one. And we'd actually gotten off to a good start.",
      "The vetting of nominees for cabinet positions, for example, has happened in basically the same way it's happened in the past. And we were able to do those, finish them up at a faster rate than ever before.",
      "But we're entering a new phase now, right? As officials actually come into their positions and are taking actions as government employees, now is when we're entering that time period where real substantive concerns about ethics and integrity can arise.",
      "And my sense is that the president just doesn't want an Office of Government Ethics that's empowered to take those issues seriously and speak to them.",
      "ABC NEWS: Are you concerned about Elon Musk's possible conflict of interest as he takes an unprecedented role in government oversight?",
      "HUITEMA: Well, I don't want to speak to any particular individuals. And, you know, part of the issue with Elon Musk and the DOGE [Department of Government Efficiency] effort, right, is we don't really know exactly what he's doing. So, I'm not privy to any details and don't have anything to share in that regard.",
      "But it's a perfect example of what a challenge it can be for people from the private sector with extensive investments and financial interests to come into government and adjust to the change in expectations, the change in rules that apply.",
      "ABC NEWS: I guess it sounds like an obvious question, but humor us here for a moment, why do you believe that government watchdogs are important?",
      "HUITEMA: Well, I think they're important for a couple of reasons. Even though they are mostly internally focused, they don't have a lot of visibility, I recognize that a lot of people watching probably have never even heard of the Office of Government Ethics, but they help set the tone and build a culture within government of respect for the rule of law, adherence to the rule of law, a commitment to public service, and an expectation of accountability for that public service.",
      "And so as those institutions are eroded, people may not see it right away, but in time, you can expect to see more corruption, more abuse of office and less accountability for that. The guardrails to sort of notice and address those kinds of concerns will be reduced.",
      "And eventually, I guess my big concern is that in the long run, if that continues now, a change of culture is really hard to reverse.",

      "On a recent hot summer day in Chile, the beaches of Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Conc\u00f3n and Re\u00f1aca are packed with holidaymakers sharing yerba mate teas and playing ball",
      "VI\u00d1A DEL MAR, Chile -- On a recent hot summer day in Chile, the beaches of Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Conc\u00f3n and Re\u00f1aca are packed with holidaymakers sharing yerba mate teas and playing ball. Others mill about in the shopping centers on the coast and in the capital, some wearing shirts with Lionel Messi\u2019s name on them, carrying bags full of clothes, video games and mobile phones.",
      "They are part of a wave of Argentines who have found Chile to be a budget-friendly paradise this southern summer.",
      "\u201cEverything here is so cheap for us,\u201d said Cristian V\u00e1zquez, who was enjoying the sea in Re\u00f1aca, on Chile\u2019s central coast.",
      "In December 2024, the start of the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s summer, more Argentines went on vacation abroad than in the previous year, with Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay as the top destinations.",
      "Despite a year of economic crisis, Argentines are flocking to beaches, mountains and shopping centers abroad, encouraged by a favorable economic outlook \u2014 and a strong peso.",
      "Between December 2023 and the same month in 2024 the Argentine peso appreciated by around 41% against the official U.S. dollar, thanks in part of a strong adjustment plan implemented by President Javier Milei, an ultra-liberal who came to power at the end of 2023 on vows to \u201cblow up\u201d the central bank, take an axe to the bloated government and kill sky-high inflation.",
      "The stampede of Argentines traveling abroad for their summer vacations is driven by several factors, including the recent devaluation of various foreign currencies, the convenience of nearby destinations accessible by car and the prohibitively high cost of domestic vacations, especially along the Argentine Atlantic coast.",
      "Argentine tourism abroad surged in December, with departures up 76.4% year-over-year to 1.3 million travelers compared to the same month the previous year, according to official figures. Of those, 80.7% visited neighboring countries, primarily Chile (28%), Brazil (22.6%) and Uruguay (15.6%).",
      "Chile has become a popular destination for Argentines, who made up 40% of the 5.2 million visitors to the country in 2024 and early 2025. Chile\u2019s strong economic position relative to Argentina has resulted in competitive prices, a major draw for Argentine tourists.",
      "Chile\u2019s tourism undersecretary, Ver\u00f3nica Pardo, noted that visitors are also spending more than in previous years, averaging about $63.3 per person per day.",
      "Argentine visitors aren\u2019t confined to the sun-drenched beaches of the Chilean coast. Messi jerseys and mate gourds are also a common sight in other neighboring countries.",
      "Nicol\u00e1s Lentini, 37, recently arrived in Brazil, drawn by the devalued real and lower prices. \u201cA week\u2019s rent for four people in Argentina costs $700,\" he said, noting that he paid the same amount for 14 days in B\u00fazios, a Brazilian resort east of Rio de Janeiro.",
      "\u201cBesides, the beaches here are incomparable to ours, where it\u2019s cold. Here, you can wear a T-shirt all day.\u201d",
      "Brazil experienced a surge in tourism after the real depreciated by around 27% in 2024, when it reached a record of 6.6 million foreign arrivals, with Argentines being the main visitors (1.9 million).",
      "Andr\u00e9s Dey\u00e1, from Argentina's federation of travel and tourism business associations, highlighted the challenges of competing with neighboring countries like Brazil.",
      "\u201cWe can provide good services, financing tools, tourism quality and everything else,\u201d he said, but ultimately \"macroeconomic issues define where Argentines decide to travel.\u201d",
      "After a four-year hiatus marked by the COVID-19 pandemic and a subsequent economic crisis, Luis S\u00e1nchez returned to the exclusive resort of Punta del Este, Uruguay.",
      "\u201cWe like it a lot... this year the prices aren\u2019t as high as they\u2019ve been,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez, one of 309,570 Argentines who visited Uruguay between December 20, 2024, and January 13, 2025, representing nearly half of all visitors to the country, where the U.S. dollar appreciated almost 13% against the Uruguayan peso in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "Tourism operators in Argentina note that the Argentine exodus was also fueled by recovering purchasing power due to falling inflation and the recent elimination of a tax on foreign credit card purchases.",
      "Sunbathing in a bikini on a Punta del Este beach, Esperanza Fagalde said she hadn\u2019t vacationed at the Uruguayan resort for the past two years. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t affordable,\u201d she said, citing the unfavorable exchange rate and high costs.",

      "At Niagara Falls, visitors from the United States and Canada are taking in President Donald Trump\u2019s unsolicited suggestion the U.S. annex its neighbor to the north with an air of detached amusement",
      "NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. -- At Niagara Falls, the iconic honeymoon and tourist destination on the U.S.-Canadian border, visitors from both countries took in President Donald Trump\u2019s unsolicited suggestion that the U.S. annex its neighbor to the north with an air of detached amusement.",
      "Do they take the idea seriously? Generally speaking, no. But some citizens of both nations wonder why it\u2019s necessary to pick a fight with one of America\u2019s closest allies when there wasn\u2019t much friction there to begin with.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re allies,\u201d said Shannon Robinson, of Milton, Ontario. \u201cWe love you guys. And we\u2019re proud of the amicable relationship we have. But we\u2019re also proud to be distinct.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s idea is bold, offensive and ignorant, but \u201che can say what he wants, and it's actually bringing Canadians together right now,\" said Robinson, standing on the Niagara Falls Observation Tower, which extends over the Niagara Gorge and affords an unobstructed view of all three falls and the Niagara River.",
      "In some instances, that togetherness involved booing. The response was slightly more muted on a recent day as bundled-up tourists from all over the world braved sub-freezing temperatures to catch a glimpse of the majestic falls.",
      "Jeremy Powers, of Panama City, Florida, said the Republican U.S. president's talk of annexing one of America's closest allies and trading partners is \u201cvery weird.\u201d",
      "\u201cHaving that as their own independent nation needs to be maintained, I feel,\u201d said Powers, who was in New York state on a work trip and decided to check out Niagara Falls.",
      "\u201cYou know, we don\u2019t need to try and manifest destiny and gather more land. We need to partner and work with other countries in a more friendly manner,\u201d Powers said before dropping down on one knee to open up a bag containing his camera equipment.",
      "Manifest destiny, the idea that the United States is exceptional among world nations and destined by God to expand its territory across North America, drove U.S. growth through the 19th century. Territorial expansion was not a prominent feature of foreign policy debates before Trump started talking about taking on Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal \u2014 and even colonizing Mars.",
      "\u201cThe United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons,\u201d Trump said in his inaugural address. \u201cAnd we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.\u201d",
      "Canadian energy minister Jonathan Wilkinson agreed that Trump is uniting Canadians, but he said they're done laughing about his talk of annexation.",
      "\u201cOn the 51st state, I think, you know, when that was said the first time, some people thought it was funny,\u201d Wilkinson said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI don\u2019t think Canadians find it funny anymore.\u201d",
      "Back at Niagara Falls, plumes of vapor rose off the frigid water. On Rainbow Bridge, an American flag and a Canadian flag stand feet apart, the representation of two neighboring countries overseeing the shared beauty of nature.",
      "Joseph Sullivan, a landscaper who made the trek from New Orleans to upstate New York, sees Trump\u2019s proposal as \u201charsh.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll he\u2019s doing,\" Sullivan said, \u201cis creating chaos and making other countries want to hate America.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General says it's launching an audit of the security controls for the federal government\u2019s payment system",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General on Friday said it was launching an audit of the security controls for the federal government's payment system, after Democratic senators raised red flags about the access provided to Trump aide Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team.",
      "The audit will also review the past two years of the system's transactions as it relates to Musk's assertion of \u201calleged fraudulent payments,\u201d according to a letter from Loren J. Sciurba, Treasury\u2019s deputy inspector general, that was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The audit marks part of the broader effort led by Democratic lawmakers and federal employee unions to provide transparency and accountability about DOGE's activities under President Donald Trump's Republican administration. The Musk team has pushed for access to the government's computer systems and sought to remove tens of thousands of federal workers.",
      "\u201cWe expect to begin our fieldwork immediately,\u201d Sciburba wrote. \u201cGiven the breadth of this effort, the audit will likely not be completed until August; however, we recognize the danger that improper access or inadequate controls can pose to the integrity of sensitive payment systems. As such, if critical issues come to light before that time, we will issue interim updates and reports.\u201d",
      "Tech billionaire Musk, who continues to control Tesla, X and SpaceX among other companies, claims to be finding waste, fraud and abuse while providing savings to taxpayers, many of his claims so far unsubstantiated. But there is a risk that his team's aggressive efforts could lead to the failure of government computer systems and enable Musk and his partners to profit off private information maintained by the government.",
      "Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon led the push for the inspector general office's inquiry.",
      "On Wednesday, Warren, Wyden and Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noting the inconsistencies in the accounts provided by his department about DOGE.",
      "\u201cYour lack of candor about these events is deeply troubling given the threats to the economy and the public from DOGE\u2019s meddling, and you need to provide a clear, complete, and public accounting of who accessed the systems, what they were doing, and why they were doing it,\u201d the Democratic lawmakers wrote in their letter.",
      "The Treasury Department provided conflicting information about DOGE's access to the payment system. Initially, it claimed the access was read only, only to then acknowledge that a DOGE team member briefly had the ability to edit code, and then to say in an employee sworn statement that the ability to edit was granted by accident.",
      "The 25-year-old employee granted the access, Marko Elez, resigned this month after racist posts were discovered on one of his social media accounts, only for Musk to call for his rehiring with the backing of Trump and Vice President JD Vance.",
      "Advocacy groups and labor unions have filed lawsuits over DOGE\u2019s potential unauthorized access to sensitive Treasury payment systems, and five former treasury secretaries have sounded the alarm on the risks associated with Musk\u2019s DOGE accessing sensitive Treasury Department payment systems and potentially stopping congressionally authorized payments.",
      "Earlier this week, the Treasury declined to brief a pair of the highest-ranking lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee, including Wyden, on the ongoing controversy related to DOGE's use of Treasury payment systems, citing ongoing litigation.",

      "Last month, an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter collided as the plane prepared to land at Washington D",
      "On Jan. 29, an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter collided as the plane prepared to land at Washington D.C.\u2019s Ronald Reagan National Airport. Both plunged into the Potomac River, killing all 67 people aboard.",
      "Since then, much of the attention has focused on the helicopter's altitude, and whether it may have been flying too high. The National Transportation Safety Board, which is handling the investigation, plans to brief reporters Friday on their probe.",
      "The collision was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground.",
      "Air travel remains overwhelmingly safe in the U.S., but there have been a string of incidents in recent weeks, including a fiery explosion on Jan. 31 when a medical transport jet crashed into a Philadelphia neighborhood, killing seven people. Last week, a small commuter aircraft crashed off western Alaska, killing 10 people.",
      "American Airlines Flight 5342 was coming in from Wichita, Kansas, carrying 60 passengers and four crew members, as it approached Reagan National to land on a clear Wednesday night. Nearby, a U.S. Army Black Hawk with three soldiers on board was on a training exercise, practicing emergency evacuation routes that would be used to ferry out key government officials in case of an attack or catastrophe.",
      "A few minutes before the twin-engine jet was to land, air traffic controllers asked if it could use a shorter runway. The pilots agreed, and flight-tracking sites show the plane adjusted its approach.",
      "Shortly before the collision, a controller got an alert that the plane and Black Hawk were converging and asked the helicopter if it had the plane in sight. The military pilot said yes and asked for \u201cvisual separation\u201d with the jet \u2014 allowing it to fly closer than otherwise may have been allowed if the pilots didn\u2019t see the plane. Controllers approved the request.",
      "Roughly 20 seconds later, the aircraft collided.",
      "Since the crash, the National Transportation Safety Board has recovered all the flight data recorders and pulled the wreckage of both aircraft from the Potomac.",
      "It will take more than a year to get the final NTSB report on the crash, but officials have been providing regular updates as investigators learn more and they plan to publish a preliminary report in the coming weeks.",
      "Almost immediately after the crash, President Donald Trump publicly faulted the helicopter, which had a flight ceiling of 200 feet (61 meters), for flying too high. He also blamed federal diversity and inclusion efforts, particularly regarding air traffic controllers. When pressed by reporters, the president could not back up those claims. A few days later, Trump placed the blame on what he called an \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system.",
      "Army officials have said the Black Hawk crew was highly experienced and familiar with the crowded skies around Washington.",
      "Altitude data was not fully clear in the early days of the investigation, with conflicting numbers from the plane's flight data recorder and the control tower.",
      "At the time, however, investigators were still working to recover information from the helicopter\u2019s black box, which had been waterlogged after plunging into the river, and to refine other data.",
      "Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet\u2019s flight recorder showed a change in its angle, though they did not say whether that indicated the pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.",
      "The Army identified the Black Hawk crew as Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach of Durham, North Carolina; Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O\u2019Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. O\u2019Hara was the crew chief and Eaves and Lobach were pilots.",
      "Among the jet\u2019s passengers were several members of the Skating Club of Boston returning from a development camp for elite junior skaters that followed the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita.",
      "The victims also included a group of hunters returning from a guided trip in Kansas, four members of a steamfitters\u2019 local union in suburban Maryland, nine students and parents from Fairfax County, Virginia, schools and two Chinese nationals."

      "Jailed and disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is suing his brother and other executives at their now-defunct film company",
      "Jailed and disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein alleges in a new lawsuit that his brother, Bob Weinstein, and other executives at their now-defunct film company duped him into guaranteeing a $45 million loan in 2016, but diverted funds for their own personal use while setting the stage for his downfall.",
      "Harvey Weinstein, 72, filed the claims Thursday in a long-running civil case in New York City involving a lender accusing him of defaulting on the loan. He is currently detained while awaiting a retrial on sex crimes charges in New York.",
      "\u201cHarvey Weinstein was deceived by those closest to him, and secured a $45 million dollar loan under the pretense of saving The Weinstein Company,\u201d Imran Ansari, Harvey Weinstein's lawyer, said in a statement. \u201cWhile Harvey personally guaranteed the loan, others within The Weinstein Company enriched themselves and strategically undermined him, leaving him \u2018holding the bag\u2019 of debt while \u2018lining their pockets\u2019 when the company was in crisis.\u201d",
      "Ansari alleged Bob Weinstein and others at The Weinstein Co. were in on a plot to position Harvey Weinstein for a downfall in an attempt to seize control of the company, which went bankrupt in 2018 as the sexual misconduct scandal surrounding Harvey Weinstein exploded.",
      "An attorney for Bob Weinstein, Brian Kohn, replied with a brief statement Friday saying, \u201cHarvey\u2019s allegations are entirely without merit,\u201d in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Former Weinstein Co. chief operating officer David Glasser, now chief executive of 101 Studios, known for its production of Paramount's popular series \u201cYellowstone,\u201d is also named in Harvey Weinstein's lawsuit. He did not immediately return a phone message left at his office Friday.",
      "AI International Holdings loaned the money to two affiliates of The Weinstein Co. and Harvey Weinstein, and later sued when it said they defaulted.",
      "Harvey Weinstein alleges that his brother, Glasser and others duped him into guaranteeing the $45 million loan by saying the money would help the financially struggling company. Instead, his lawsuit says, they diverted millions of dollars from the company for improper purposes, leaving it short on cash and Harvey Weinstein liable for repaying the loan.",
      "\u201cAs a direct result of these actions, the Companies were drained of, at the very least, $12 million in cash that should have been allocated to repay the Loan owed to AI International,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cThis mismanagement left the Companies unable to satisfy their financial obligations, resulting in insolvency and placing Weinstein at substantial personal financial risk as the guarantor of the Loan.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the state Supreme Court in Manhattan, says Weinstein was made to suffer \u201csevere and outrageous financial and reputational harm.\u201d",
      "It also makes several allegations of financial misconduct against Bob Weinstein, Glasser and others.",
      "It accuses Bob Weinstein of withdrawing at least $6 million from company accounts under false pretenses, to give himself priority over creditors including AI International.",
      "The lawsuit alleges Glasser approved and received $5 million in excessive bonuses and unauthorized financial transactions, and used company funds to pay his father $1 million despite no legitimate business reason.",
      "AI International Holdings sued Harvey Weinstein and the two affiliates of The Weinstein Co. in late 2017. The lawsuit said they defaulted on the loan after AI International had ordered the entire balance to be paid immediately because Harvey Weinstein had been dismissed as co-chairman amid the sexual misconduct allegations.",
      "According to Harvey Weinstein, Bob Weinstein and Glasser settled their liability for the loan with AI International for about $15 million due to \u201cbad faith negotiations,\u201d leaving Harvey Weinstein responsible for the remaining $30 million plus interest.",
      "Harvey Weinstein's lawsuit seeks to shield him from any financial liability for the loan, as well as punitive damages for alleged fraud and financial misconduct and his legal fees.",
      "Bob Weinstein recently asked the judge to reject subpoenas for documents and a deposition issued by Harvey Weinstein's lawyer.",
      "Harvey Weinstein, who also co-founded the film company Miramax, was once one of the most powerful people in Hollywood, having produced films such as \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cThe Crying Game.\u201d",
      "In 2017, he became the most prominent villain of the #MeToo movement, which erupted when women began going public with accounts of his behavior.",
      "He has long maintained that any sexual activity was consensual.",
      "Harvey Weinstein is being retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013. Another charge filed in September alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "His 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence were overturned last year, as an appeals court found the trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against Weinstein based on allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case."

      "No longer in charge, Sen. Mitch McConnell has been speaking his mind",
      "WASHINGTON -- No longer in charge, Sen. Mitch McConnell has been speaking his mind, the long-serving GOP leader rejecting President Donald Trump\u2019s more high-profile Cabinet nominees \u2014 alone at times, among the Republicans, casting his no votes.",
      "When it came to Pete Hegseth, now the defense secretary, who faced allegations of excessive drinking and aggressive behavior toward women, McConnell said the combat veteran had \u201cfailed, as yet, to demonstrate\u201d he was ready for the job.",
      "The \u201cdesire to be a change agent is not enough,\u201d McConnell said.",
      "On Tulsi Gabbard, who was sworn in this week as director of national intelligence, he said she has displayed \u201ca history of alarming lapses in judgment,\u201d citing in particular her views toward Russia, China and the security breach by former government contractor Edward Snowden.",
      "And as Senate Republicans confirmed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, McConnell, a survivor of childhood polio  who used a wheelchair during the vote, opposed.",
      "\u201cA record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions does not entitle Mr. Kennedy to lead these important efforts,\u201d the Kentucky senator said.",
      "This is McConnell unplugged, three weeks into the Trump administration, and his new role as no longer the Senate GOP leader but one of 100 senators. It is testing the strength, but also the limits, of his influence on the institution, where he has been a monumental presence for nearly 40 years.",
      "McConnell is far from an anti-Trump Republican and hardly the face of the GOP opposition to the White House. He has voted to confirm Trump\u2019s other nominees and said he expects to support Trump's agenda.",
      "But his opposition to the trio of Trump's most controversial nominees stands out. Taken together, McConnell's votes against Hegseth, Gabbard and RFK Jr. provide a window into the type of leader he intends to be outside the stately leadership office. And it shows the shifts in his power, as few other Republicans joined him, leaving him often on his own, with Democrats, unable to stop Trump's choices.",
      "\u201cMcConnell\u2019s votes on the Trump nominees reflect, at least in part, the fact that he is more free to vote in accord with personal preferences than he was when he was responsible for serving as the leader and voice for Senate Republicans,\u201d said Frances Lee, a professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton.",
      "Just two other Republicans, the independent-minded Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, also voted against Hegseth.",
      "\u201cNow that he is no longer in leadership, Sen. McConnell enjoys more freedom to simply exercise his own individual judgment and personal discretion,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Trump lashed out after the latest votes, calling McConnell \u201cbitter\u201d and \u201cnot equipped mentally\u201d during a lengthy rant in the Oval Office late Thursday, after Kennedy was sworn into office.",
      "\u201cI feel sorry for Mitch,\u201d the Republican president said.",
      "\u201cHe votes against almost everything now. He\u2019s a, you know, very bitter guy,\u201d Trump said of McConnell, who had been a crucial partner as the Senate majority leader during Trump's first term.",
      "Together, Trump and McConnell passed shared priorities, notably the 2017 GOP tax bill, but the two also clashed \u2014 the president calling the senator \u201cOld Crow,\u201d which McConnell turned into a badge of honor \u2014 and had a very public falling out after the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden. McConnell called Trump \u201cmorally responsible\u201d for the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection by a mob of his supporters at the Capitol but ultimately endorsed Trump's reelection bid.",
      "Trump did not appear Thursday to understand that McConnell had polio as a child, a factor as he weighed Kennedy's nomination.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s lost his power,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things.\u201d",
      "When he announced he was stepping down as GOP leader, McConnell said he would finish his Senate term, which expires after the 2026 election. It\u2019s unclear if he will run again.",
      "To be sure, McConnell is far from marginalized. He commands prime positions as chairman of the influential Rules Committee as well as the chairman of the Appropriation Committee\u2019s subcommittee on defense, where he has signaled he intends to make his mark shoring up the nation\u2019s military assets and assuring U.S. leadership on the global stage.",
      "\u201cI expect to support most of what this administration is trying to accomplish,\u201d McConnell said during a recent interview on CBS' \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d",
      "The senator still faces polio\u2019s lingering effects, particularly in his left leg. McConnell fell twice recently, on the steps from the Senate chamber, where he was swiftly caught and steadied by two GOP colleagues, and a short time later in the private GOP lunchroom. He sometimes uses a wheelchair as he did this week as a precaution.",
      "Other senators are watching and weighing the turn of events.",
      "\u201cHe seems to be liberated, and I think he\u2019s voting his conscience,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat.",
      "Blumenthal said while other Republicans are \u201cin a state of trembling in fear\u201d over primary threats if they don\u2019t fall in line with Trump\u2019s agenda, particularly from billionaire Trump aide Elon Musk\u2019s political group, McConnell is not among them.",
      "\u201cWhatever his motivation, he is certainly demonstrating that courage and conscience still matter,\u201d he said.",
      "New Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, said, \u201cThe great part about being a senator is that you get to decide what\u2019s important to you, what your priorities are, and he should represent the people who elected him.\u201d",
      "McConnell\u2019s critics have also taken notice. Nate Morris, a businessman in Kentucky, said this week he is considering a Senate run in 2026.",
      "\u201cI think President Trump needs less of these weak, career politicians running for office and more outside businessmen who are going to fight for his America First agenda,\u201d Morris posted on social media this week.",
      "Citing McConnell\u2019s opposition to Hegseth, Morris said McConnell \"turned his back on President Trump.\u201d",

      "Conservatives who have spent decades promoting deep cuts to government are giving mixed reviews to the Department of Government Efficiency, the Elon Musk-led project to slash the federal workforce and reduce or end disfavored programs",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Conservatives who have spent decades promoting deep cuts to government are giving mixed reviews to the Department of Government Efficiency, the Elon Musk-led project to slash the federal workforce and reduce or end disfavored programs.",
      "The Associated Press interviewed four veteran budget hawks, including some who have worked on Republican presidential campaigns predating Musk or President Donald Trump becoming dominant in GOP politics.",
      "Some say Musk\u2019s early targets demonstrate success and show more potential than previous efforts to downsize government due to his unique access and influence. Others say it\u2019s too early to tell and argue that DOGE has stoked conservative outrage about specific agencies without going after much bigger pieces of the federal budget, like defense spending or programs with bipartisan support like Medicare and Social Security.",
      "A list of savings provided by the White House last week noted at least $2.2 billion in initial savings identified by the group. The DOGE website has since noted at least $5.6 billion. Any total so far is a tiny fraction of Musk's initial goal of $2 trillion, the size of the federal budget deficit, or even the $1 trillion he has since mentioned more regularly.",
      "Here's what the budget hawks said:",
      "Norquist, whose government-cutting advocacy goes back to the administration of President Ronald Reagan, is famous for having said in 2001, \u201cI don\u2019t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\u201d",
      "He cheered Musk's early efforts.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at what they found after looking for a few days \u2014 I\u2019m not going to second-guess some of the larger numbers they are talking about \u2014 this thing has paid for itself many times over now,\" Norquist said. As of last week, DOGE was operating with about $14 million, according to the Office of Management and Budget.",
      "\u201cNever mind if they find anything more,\u201d Norquist added.",
      "Musk is succeeding, no matter the final tally of DOGE's work, because he has unfettered access both to Trump and millions of followers on the social media platform he owns, X, Norquist said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t bat it down and tell it to go away because X is out there before defenders of allowing Washington to do whatever it wants,\u201d Norquist said. \u201cThat group can\u2019t get over the fact that 10 million people read a tweet by Elon Musk listing five things suggesting Washington is out of control.\u201d",
      "Musk's early efforts appear to be aimed more at satisfying Trump's culturally conservative base than targeting the biggest government spending sources, said Riedl, a veteran Republican budget analyst who was chief economist for former Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, the conservative Heritage Foundation's senior budget researcher, and the architect of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s 10-year deficit reduction proposal.",
      "By seeking to eradicate racial and gender-based diversity, equity and inclusion spending from the the federal civil service, Musk is succeeding in getting the attention of Trump-styled conservatives with relatively few dollars to show for it, she said.",
      "Cancelling so-called DEI contracts across the federal government is akin to cancelling the media subscriptions to national outlets such as The Associated Press, The New York Times, Politico and The Washington Post, she said. They are all regular targets of criticism from Trump's core supporters.",
      "\u201cSo far, DOGE seems more about looking for symbolic culture war savings than truly reducing the budget deficit in any meaningful way,\u201d said Riedl,",
      "Likewise, Musk's effort to encourage many of the hundreds of thousands of eligible federal employees to accept terms to quit immediately in exchange for months of pay is seen by that same segment of voters as ridding the government of a force seen as thwarting Trump's policy agenda.",
      "\u201cThese really get attention of Trump conservatives as fronts in the culture war, but ultimately do not save very much money at all,\" Riedl said.",
      "A large majority of federal spending is tied up in Medicare and Social Security, veterans benefits, defense spending and interest on the national debt. During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump insisted he would protect the two politically sacrosanct entitlement programs and expand the U.S. military, making these areas unlikely targets for cuts.",
      "\u201cIf Trump were serious about the deficit, he'd be addressing Social Security, Medicare, defense and veterans benefits,\u201d Riedl said. \u201cAnd that's if the public even cares. I've seen no real evidence that they do.\u201d",
      "Only about a quarter of Americans said they were in favor of, as Musk recommended Thursday, eliminating entire federal agencies, according to an Associated Press-NORC poll conducted in January. Likewise, only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults said they favored eliminating a large number of federal jobs.",
      "So far, DOGE's recommendations read like a public relations campaign aimed at discrediting the federal government, said Nowrasteh, an executive for the libertarian think tank and co-author of a report published in December recommending cuts to Musk's group.",
      "Nowrasteh thinks the group may be shoring up its standing with conservative voters before it reaches for further buy-in among more moderate voters.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to take down portions of the government that appear to be liberal or left leaning. And in the process, they are trying to expose some of the sillier aspects of what is being funded,\" he said.",
      "The Cato Institute called for cutting 10% of the federal workforce \u2014 translating to a loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs \u2014 and requiring at least 10% compensation cuts for those that remain. Besides the defense and entitlement cuts, they also propose selling all federal land, turning national parks over to states for management, among myriad other dramatic changes.",
      "\u201cMost of the public is innumerate,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don't know the difference between a million and a billion. It seems like a lot of money to you and me. But to the federal government, it's nothing.\u201d",
      "With Musk\u2019s global profile and access in Trump\u2019s world, DOGE has the potential to be far-reaching in a way previous efforts at deficit and budget reduction have not, said Madni, who leads a newer conservative budget and spending think tank aimed at working closely with Congress.",
      "The access that Trump is granting DOGE means Musk\u2019s team will have a view into a broad range of the government\u2019s spending, she said. And Musk\u2019s huge social media following, paired with Trump\u2019s election victory, gives the project an air of momentum, Madni said.",
      "\u201cWe see DOGE as an incredible opportunity to address some of the challenges that we have known existed in federal spending for a long time and haven\u2019t really had the window to address,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s making budget cuts, budget review, cool again.\u201d",
      "She argued the Republican-controlled Congress would also be more likely to limit its budgets with DOGE's help.",
      "\u201cI think part of this conversation really has to be that DOGE is doing a phenomenal job already highlighting that there are places to make cuts, to reprioritize and save taxpayers money and reduce the deficit,\u201d she said. \u201cBut besides that, there is Congress.\u201d"

      "\u201cOpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk\u2019s latest attempt to disrupt his competition,\" said a statement Friday from Bret Taylor, chair of OpenAI's board.",
      "OpenAI attorney William Savitt in a letter to Musk's attorney Friday said the proposal \u201cis not in the best interests of OAI\u2019s mission and is rejected.\u201d",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor, began a legal offensive against the ChatGPT maker nearly a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit he helped found a decade ago.",
      "Then on Monday, while that case was still awaiting a key ruling, Musk and his own AI startup, xAI, and a group of investment firms announced a bid to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI. Musk in a court filing Wednesday expanded on the proposal to acquire the nonprofit\u2019s controlling stake in the for-profit OpenAI subsidiary.",
      "Savitt's letter Friday said that filing added \u201cnew material conditions to the proposal. As a result of that filing, it is now apparent that your clients\u2019 much-publicized \u2018bid\u2019 is in fact not a bid at all.\u201d In any event, \u201ceven as first presented,\u201d the board has unanimously rejected it, Savitt said.",
      "Musk has alleged in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity. Musk had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer has said.",
      "He escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including OpenAI's business partner Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would halt OpenAI\u2019s plans to more fully convert itself into a for-profit business. Musk also added xAI as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was also unfairly stifling business competition. A judge is still considering Musk's request but expressed skepticism about some of his claims in a court hearing last week."

      "In the wooded outskirts of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, a perplexed landlord noticed odd sights at two of his rental properties.",
      "Tenants wore long black coats and parked box trucks outside the duplexes. They ran an electrical cord from one box truck into one of the condos, and kept a stretcher inside another.",
      "A neighbor remembers similarly dressed figures walking around at night holding hands. They never spoke a word.",
      "By the time the FBI searched the property last week, one of the most recent tenants had been killed in a shootout with U.S. Border Patrol agents in Vermont, and a second was under arrest. A third, a shadowy figure known online as \u201cZiz,\u201d remains missing after authorities linked their cultlike group to six deaths in three states.",
      "Officials have offered few details of the cross-country investigation, which broke open after the Jan. 20 shooting death of a Border Patrol trooper in Vermont during a traffic stop. Associated Press interviews and a review of court records and online postings tell the story of how a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.",
      "Their goals aren\u2019t clear, but online writings span topics from radical veganism and gender identity to artificial intelligence.",
      "At the middle of it all is \u201cZiz,\u201d who appears to be the leader of the strange group, who called themselves \u201cZizians.\u201d She has been seen near multiple crime scenes and has connections to various suspects.",
      "She was even declared dead for a time, before reappearing amid more violence.",
      "Jack LaSota moved to the San Francisco Bay area after earning a computer science degree from the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2013 and interning at NASA, according to a profile on a hiring site for programmers, coders and other freelance workers. NASA officials did not respond to a request to confirm LaSota's internship, but a Jack LaSota is listed on a website about past interns.",
      "In 2016, she began publishing a dark and rambling blog under the name Ziz, describing her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and \u201coften desire to kill each other.\u201d",
      "LaSota used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman. She railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.",
      "LaSota began promoting an extreme mix of rationalism, ethical veganism, anarchism and other value systems, said Jessica Taylor, an AI researcher who met LaSota both in person and online through the rationalist community and knew her as Ziz.",
      "When LaSota left the rationalists behind, she took with her a group of \u201cextremely vulnerable and isolated\u201d followers, Anna Salamon, executive director of the Center for Applied Rationality, told the San Francisco Chronicle.",
      "Taylor said Ziz adherents use the rationalist ideology as a reason to commit violence. \u201cStuff like, thinking it\u2019s reasonable to avoid paying rent and defend oneself from being evicted,\u201d she said.",
      "Poulomi Saha, a professor who has studied cults, said LaSota\u2019s beliefs and writings may have made readers feel seen, an often central factor in the formation of groups commonly labeled cults. That\u2019s especially true in the era of online communities, in which it\u2019s easier for marginalized people to seek fellow believers.",
      "\u201cFor the person who feels hailed by that blog post, there is likely to be a kind of dual experience,\u201d said Saha, co-director of the program in critical theory at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cOne where they feel like \u2018I have been saying this, or thinking this, all along, and no one has believed me.\u2019\u201d",
      "LaSota, 34, has not responded to multiple Associated Press emails in recent weeks, and her attorney Daniel McGarrigle declined to comment when asked whether she is connected to any of the deaths. She has missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants have been issued for her arrest. Associated Press reporters have left numerous phone and e-mail messages with LaSota's family and received no response.",
      "In November 2019, LaSota was arrested along with several other people at a protest outside a Northern California retreat center where the Center for Applied Rationality was holding an event. Sheriff\u2019s deputies called in a SWAT team and armored vehicle after the mask-wearing group blocked the property\u2019s exits and handed out fliers railing against the rationalist organization. The group said they were protesting sexual misconduct inside the rationalist group.",
      "The case against LaSota, Emma Borhanian, 31, Gwen Danielson and Alexander Leatham, 29, was pending in August 2022 when the U.S. Coast Guard responded to a report that LaSota had fallen out of a boat in San Francisco Bay. Her body wasn\u2019t found, but her mother confirmed the death and an obituary was published.",
      "It wasn\u2019t long before Ziz surfaced again.",

      "Prosecutors say she was among those who attacked Lind on Nov. 13 when he tried to evict the group for not paying rent.",
      "Impaled by a sword and partially blinded, Lind fought back, fatally shooting Borhanian. Concluding that Lind acted in self-defense, officials charged Leatham and Suri Dao, 23, with murder in Borhanian\u2019s death, as well as attempted murder of Lind.",
      "A person reached by an Associated Press reporter at a phone number listed for Alex Leatham\u2019s father declined to comment. Attempts to reach family members for Dao were not successful.",
      "Police believe LaSota was at the scene of the crime, but she was not arrested.",
      "On New Year\u2019s Eve of 2022, a couple was shot and killed in their home in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania.",
      "A doorbell camera captured audio and video of a car pulling up to the home of Richard Zajko, 71, and his wife, Rita, 69. A voice shouts \u201cMom!\u201d and another voice exclaims, \u201cOh my God! Oh, God, God!\u201d according to a Pennsylvania state police affidavit. Police found the couple shot in the head in an upstairs bedroom after they failed to show up to take care of Rita\u2019s mother.",
      "Police questioned the couple\u2019s daughter, Michelle, at her home in Vermont, and a few weeks later, took her into custody at a Pennsylvania hotel. She wasn't arrested or charged with anything. LaSota was at the hotel, too, and was arrested after refusing to cooperate with officers, and charged with obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct.",
      "Six months later, LaSota was released on bail but stopped showing up for court.",
      "LaSota\u2019s attorney, Daniel McGarrigle, said last month his client was \u201cwholly and unequivocally innocent of the charges filed in this case.\u201d",

      "Maximilian Snyder, 22, who is charged with murder, appeared in court Feb. 6, only long enough to request a new attorney. It's not clear how he was identified as a suspect; he has ties to a woman who just days later would be involved in a shootout.",
      "Snyder is listed as in custody in the Solano County Jail in California. Attempts to reach family members of Snyder were not successful.",
      "On. Jan 20, in Vermont, U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped a vehicle carrying two people connected to the Ziz group. A hotel worker had called authorities after seeing one of them, Teresa Youngblut, with a gun.",
      "Youngblut was driving the car when it was pulled over on Jan. 20, and authorities say she quickly opened fire on officers. The passenger, Felix Bauckholt, a German national who is also listed in court documents as Ophelia, died, along with the border patrol agent, David Maland.",
      "Youngblut was wounded and arrested and has pleaded not guilty to firearms charges.",
      "Authorities who searched the car found a ballistic helmet, night-vision goggles, respirators and ammunition, the FBI said. They also found two-way radios and used shooting range targets.",
      "Youngblut applied for a marriage license with Snyder, the man accused of murdering the elderly landlord. He was a childhood friend; it was unclear if they were married. Authorities say the gun she was carrying was purchased by a person of interest in the Zajko killings.",
      "Youngblut and Bauckholt had been living at the two condos in North Carolina, where the landlord and neighbors now say they saw the odd behavior.",
      "LaSota also had been living there as recently as this winter, said the landlord, who reviewed LaSota\u2019s 2019 police booking photo. He spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because he was concerned for his safety.",

      "LIBERTY, Mo. -- An 86-year-old Kansas City man pleaded guilty Friday to a lesser charge in the 2023 shooting of Ralph Yarl, a Black honor student who rang the white man\u2019s doorbell by mistake.",
      "Andrew Lester was scheduled to stand trial next week on charges of first-degree assault and armed criminal action in the shooting of the then-16-year-old, who survived and is now a freshman at Texas A&M, where he is a member of ROTC and the school's marching band.",
      "As part of a plea deal, Lester pleaded guilty to second-degree assault, a charge that Judge David Chamberlain said carries up to seven years behind bars. Lester, who will be sentenced on March 7, was hunched over as he was wheeled into the courtroom, his hands folded.",
      "Yarl and his mother, Cleo Nagbe, sat in the front row during the hearing.",
      "In a statement issued after Lester's plea, Nagbe thanked her family's supporters who \u201csaw Ralph\u2019s humanity, and rejected a world where fear and prejudice endanger innocent lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile this marks a step toward accountability, true justice requires consequences that reflect the severity of his actions \u2014 anything less would be a failure to recognize the harm he has caused,\u201d she said.",
      "The state will seek a five-year prison sentence for Lester, Clay County Prosecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson told reporters after the hearing.",
      "\u201cSelf-defense has limits,\u201d Thompson said.",
      "Under the first-degree assault charge, Lester was facing a potential sentence of between 15 and 30 years behind bars, depending on the circumstances. One of the key elements of second-degree assault is that defendants \u201chave the burden of injecting the issue of influence of sudden passion arising from adequate cause.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is probably perceived as some middle ground, and the heat of passion would be what was the motivation for the shooting,\u201d said J.R. Hobbs, a Kansas City defense attorney who is not involved in the case. \u201cIf he was afraid or whatever, it may not rise to a full defense. The parties might agree to that because on one hand, it\u2019s a felony conviction \u2014 no trial, no possible appeal. On the other hand, with a lesser statutory limit, the defendant\u2019s exposure is less as well.\u201d",
      "Yarl showed up on Lester\u2019s doorstep on the night of April 13, 2023, after he mixed up the streets where he was supposed to pick up his twin siblings.",
      "Lester\u2019s attorney, Steve Salmon, has long argued that Lester was acting in self-defense and that he was terrified by the stranger who knocked on his door as he settled into bed. Authorities say Lester shot Yarl twice: first in the head, then in the arm.",
      "The shooting shocked the country and renewed national debate about gun policies and race in the U.S.",
      "Yarl testified at an earlier hearing that he rang the bell and then waited for someone to answer for what seemed \u201clonger than normal.\u201d As the inner door opened, Yarl said, he reached out to grab the storm door.",
      "\u201cI assume these are my brothers\u2019 friends\u2019 parents,\u201d he said.",
      "He said Lester shot him in the head and uttered, \u201cDon\u2019t come here ever again.\u201d Although the bullet didn\u2019t penetrate Yarl\u2019s brain, the impact knocked him to the ground. Yarl said Lester then shot him in the arm. The teen was taken to the hospital and released three days later.",
      "His family said the shooting took a big emotional toll and they have filed a lawsuit against the retired aircraft mechanic.",
      "Salmon said last year that Lester\u2019s physical and mental condition had deteriorated. He said Lester has had heart issues, a broken hip and has been hospitalized. Lester also has lost 50 pounds (23 kilograms), which Salmon blamed on the stress of intense media coverage and death threats he subsequently received.",
      "During Friday's hearing, the judge asked Lester whether he was in poor health. Lester responded yes.",
      "A judge had previously ordered a mental evaluation of Lester but allowed for the trial to proceed after its completion. The results of that evaluation were not released publicly.",

      "Del",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- Del. Destiny LeVere Bolling became the first woman in Virginia allowed by political leaders to vote remotely after she delivered her child last week, casting her votes miles from a statehouse historically governed by men.",
      "About a third of state lawmakers are women, garnering 49 out of 140 seats. And of those female legislators, about two dozen have kids under 18, ranging from newborns to teens. But while LeVere Bolling juggled committee meetings, the delegate went into labor. Clerk G. Paul Nardo confirmed she is the first lawmaker granted permission to vote remotely because of childbirth.",
      "\u201cBeing a woman, you feel pressured to just always show up,\u201d she said before giving birth. \u201cI feel compelled because of the issues \u2014 I feel compelled because of the lives that we\u2019re all leading and the tumultuous political climate that we\u2019re living in to be here. I almost feel this guilt or shame for being pregnant during this time, and I shouldn\u2019t, right?\u201d",
      "The Virginia House of Delegates first allowed remote voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic and hosted virtual sessions, whereas the Senate continued to meet in person but allowed members to participate online. This year\u2019s House rules allow Democratic House Speaker Don Scott to approve a member to participate electronically to ensure their safety.",
      "He said letting LeVere Bolling vote remotely was a no-brainer.",
      "\u201cWe want to live our values,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe say we believe in families. We say we want people to participate when they\u2019re young when they have something to think about. We don\u2019t need all the legislators to be very old and people who have grown children.\u201d",
      "In a body tracing its lineage back four centuries, women only began representing Virginians in 1924. A database of Virginia Delegates shows more than 9,500 men have served the body compared to 123 women. Today, Virginia is one of the states with the highest representation of mothers caring for minors in its statehouse.",
      "Elsewhere, the Colorado House also allows lawmakers to vote remotely for health reasons. But 31 states do not allow remote participation in floor proceedings in either chamber as of 2023, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Experts say the varying policies show that procedural rules were not designed with mothers in mind.",
      "\u201cProxy voting in Virginia would be a significant step towards modernizing our legislatures,\u201d Liuba Grechen Shirley, founder of the Vote Mama Foundation, said in a statement. \u201cHowever, we need to do more to ensure lawmakers with caregiving responsibilities are fully included in the legislative process.\u201d",
      "Del. Adele McClure had a daughter in October and has spent the session navigating postpartum, pumping breast milk on the House floor and rushing to see her daughter after long days.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had to kind of learn different ways to adapt and adjust to motherhood and postpartum life and healing,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m definitely not the same person I was last session.\u201d",
      "Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker said she took her 8-month-old baby with her to the Legislature last year, a challenging situation. She said she hoped opportunities for proxy votes would become normalized, noting discussions in Congress about whether U.S. lawmakers should vote remotely.",
      "\u201cEvery single year, we have members who have medical conditions, or every single year, I\u2019ve seen paramedics called to the House floor for a member,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cHealth is unpredictable.\u201d",
      "In the House chamber on Thursday, lawmakers debated a tax-related Senate bill previously opposed by the governor. After a spirited debate, lawmakers cast their votes. The clerk spoke into his microphone: \u201cDelegate LeVere Bolling?\u201d",
      "\u201cAye,\u201d LeVere Bolling responded, her voice booming in the chamber\u2019s speakers. The bill passed 62-33.",

      "A beluga calf born in July is growing and meeting the other members of Shedd Aquarium's pod in Chicago",
      "CHICAGO -- Charlie Jacobsma slapped the surface of a pool enclosure at Chicago\u2019s Shedd Aquarium and scanned the water for movement.",
      "Moments later, the head of a beluga calf emerged, mouth agape in what looked like a smile. Jacobsma's face lit up in response as he cooed to the calf like a human parent to a toddler.",
      "Shedd\u2019s animal care team described its newest resident, born to 35-year-old resident beluga Naya in July 2024, as just that.",
      "\u201cLike a toddler that\u2019s learning to talk and making noises, he\u2019s the same way,\" said Jacobsma, director of animal behavior and training at Shedd. \"He\u2019s just constantly growing and developing.\u201d",
      "The calf received several herrings from Jacobsma, who noted the baby whale has yet to grow in his teeth.",
      "For the aquarium staff, every birth is significant and the first beluga born at Shedd in four years was no different. Shedd staff have witnessed 15 beluga births since 1991.",
      "There was an all-hands-on-deck approach that summer evening, with divers in the water to ensure success. Bella, another female in the enclosure, helped the newborn to the surface before Naya took over.",
      "Baby boy beluga \u2014 his current moniker \u2014 is slowly being introduced to the rest of Shedd's pod of eight whales. Aquarium members are voting on options for the calf's name.",
      "In the wild, belugas live in remote arctic and sub-arctic waters where it is hard to gather research. Much of what humans know about belugas, especially births, comes from aquariums, Jacobsma said.",
      "The largest beluga whales at the aquarium have grown as long as 14 feet (4.26 meters) and weigh over 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms), and it is not uncommon for them to live into their 30s under human care, according to Kayley Galassini, a Shedd spokesperson. Some of the belugas born at Shedd are moved to other accredited aquariums once they have reached maturity, she said.",
      "Shedd\u2019s animals are trained to voluntarily participate in their own healthcare, so staff are able to monitor pregnancies through ultrasounds and other care.",
      "What surprises Jacobsma about this young whale and the rest of the Shedd's pod?",
      "Tongue tickles.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know who the first person was to put their hand in a beluga\u2019s mouth to figure it out, but it\u2019s very sensitive in their mouth, probably from the prey that they eat at the bottom of the ocean,\" Jacobsma said. \"It\u2019s almost like petting a dog or a cat, and you\u2019ll see them come up and want to interact with us and open up their mouth wide for those tongue tickles.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Tennessee city has approved a $28 million settlement in a lawsuit that said police deliberately botched investigations into a suspect accused in multiple lawsuits of drugging and sexually assaulting dozens of women",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Tennessee city agreed Thursday to pay $28 million to settle a lawsuit that said police deliberately botched investigations into a suspect accused in civil cases of drugging and sexually assaulting dozens of women.",
      "If approved by a federal judge, the settlement would resolve the lawsuit filed by women under \u201cJane Doe\u201d pseudonyms against the city and individual police officers over sexual assault allegations against Sean Williams from 2018 to 2021.",
      "The city and the officers have long denied corruption allegations. Before commissioners voted on the settlement, an attorney representing the city said continuing the case posed a financial risk.",
      "\u201cJohnson City does not blame these victims whatsoever,\" said Commissioner Jenny Brock. \"It was Sean Williams that is to blame for all of this.\u201d",
      "Williams is in prison for producing images of child sexual abuse and breaking out of an inmate transfer van in 2023. He has not yet been criminally charged as a result of the women's allegations.",
      "The lawsuit includes a broader settlement class of up to 400 women, including minors, who lodged any report of sexual abuse or trafficking to Johnson City Police from 2018 through December 2022, due to accusations of gender discrimination, Jonathan Lakey, an attorney representing the city, told commissioners. Insurance would cover part of the settlement, he said.",
      "The women in the case have been able to gain some closure and can begin healing, said Vanessa Baehr-Jones, an attorney representing the plaintiffs and broader class of women.",
      "\u201cIt has been a painful journey for these women; it has been a hard journey; and it has ultimately led to a successful and empowering end,\u201d Baehr-Jones wrote in an statement.",
      "The lawsuit is one of three that accuse the Johnson City Police Department of refusing to properly investigate evidence that Williams was drugging and raping women in their east Tennessee community for years. Williams has told The Tennessean he was framed by law enforcement to cover up a broader public corruption scandal.",
      "A former federal prosecutor and a woman who plunged from Williams' fifth-floor apartment window filed the other federal lawsuits. The Jane Does case alleges Williams paid police to obstruct investigations into sexual assault allegations against him.",
      "The former prosecutor\u2019s lawsuit said police deliberately botched her effort to arrest Williams on a federal felon-possessing-ammunition charge in April 2021, enabling him to flee. He was on the run when police arrested him in North Carolina two years later. The city countered that the prosecutor took five months to obtain an indictment when police requested one in 2020.",
      "Attorneys for the officers sued by the Jane Does said those officers \u201cnever turned a blind eye to Williams in any way\u201d and that the department\u2019s actions led to Williams' capture and conviction. As part of the settlement, the plaintiffs are expected to say in court filings that there was a high risk of not proving allegations of corruption, bribery, conspiracy and obstruction of enforcing the law against sex trafficking, among other accusations.",
      "\u201cHopefully, with the City\u2019s settlement, everyone can put this behind them and begin to heal, including the victims of Sean Williams and the officers who were wrongfully accused,\u201d the officers' attorneys wrote Thursday.",
      "A Western Carolina University campus police officer found Williams asleep in his car in 2023 while on the lam, according to a police report.",
      "His vehicle contained cocaine, methamphetamine, about $100,000 and digital storage devices with more than 5,000 images of child sexual abuse. Williams was also in possession of photos and videos showing him sexually assaulting at least 52 women at his Johnson City apartment while they were in an \u201cobvious state of unconsciousness,\u201d police wrote.",
      "At least half a dozen names on the folders of videos of women were consistent with first names on a list labeled \u201cRaped\u201d that Johnson City officers had previously found in his apartment, a police affidavit said.",
      "After being charged for the child sexual abuse images, Williams in October 2023 escaped from a van taking him from a Kentucky detention center to a hearing in Tennessee. Authorities caught him in Florida more than a month later.",
      "Jurors convicted him in July of the escape, punishable by up to five years in prison. In November, the 53-year-old was convicted of the child sexual abuse images charges, carrying 15 years minimum in prison for each of three counts. His sentencing is Feb. 24.",
      "In Tennessee state court, Williams faces additional sexual charges involving minors. In a North Carolina federal court, he's charged with possessing child sexual abuse images and illegal drugs.",
      "Johnson City ordered an outside investigation that found police conducted inconsistent, ineffective and incomplete sexual assault investigations; inadequately managed records; had insufficient training and policies; and sometimes showed gender-based stereotypes and bias, according to results released in 2023.",
      "The city said it began improving the department before the findings, including following a new sexual assault investigation protocol and creating a \u201ccomfortable space\u201d for victim interviews."

Trump also blamed federal diversity and inclusion efforts, particularly regarding air traffic controllers. When pressed by reporters, the president could not back up those claims.

      "As the helicopter is approaching the airport, the cockpit voice recorder captures the pilot saying it is flying at 300 feet (91 meters) and the instructor pilot says it is at 400 feet (122 meters). The discrepancy isn't explained and the helicopter continues to descend. The ceiling for the helicopter flight gets progressively lower as it approaches the airport.",
      "At 8:46, the controller radios the Black Hawk crew to say a passenger jet, referred to as CRJ, is at 1,200 feet (365 meters) and circling to Runway 33. The helicopter's pilots say they see the jet and ask for permission to maintain visual separation \u2014 allowing it to fly closer than otherwise may have been allowed if the pilots didn\u2019t see the plane. Controllers approve the request.",

      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- President Donald Trump's newly installed attorney general, Pam Bondi, has ordered the transfer of a federal inmate to Oklahoma so he can be executed, following through on Trump's sweeping executive order to more actively support the death penalty.",
      "Bondi this week directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to transfer inmate George John Hanson, 60, so that he can be executed for his role in the kidnapping and killing of a 77-year-old woman in Tulsa in 1999.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Justice owes it to the victim and her family \u2014 as well as the public \u2014 to transfer inmate Hanson so that Oklahoma can carry out this just sentence,\u201d Bondi wrote in a memo to the BOP's director.",
      "Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who sought Hanson's transfer last month, praised Bondi's swift action. He requested Hanson be transferred before Oklahoma's next execution on March 20 so that he would be eligible for the next available execution date, likely in June.",
      "Hanson was sentenced to death in Tulsa County, Oklahoma, after he was convicted of carjacking, kidnapping and killing Mary Bowles after he and an accomplice kidnapped the woman from a Tulsa shopping mall.",
      "Hanson, whose name in Oklahoma court records is listed as John Fitzgerald Hanson, has been serving a life sentence in federal prison in Louisiana for several federal convictions, including being a career criminal, that predate his state death sentence.",
      "Hanson's attorneys with the federal Public Defender's Office did not immediately comment on Bondi's order.",
      "Drummond\u2019s predecessor, John O\u2019Connor, previously sought Hanson\u2019s transfer and sued the Bureau of Prisons in 2022 after it refused to turn over the inmate to state custody during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. The agency\u2019s regional director at the time, Heriberto Tellez, said the transfer was not in the public interest, a decision Drummond called \u201cappalling.\u201d"

      "Maland, 44, was killed in a Jan. 20 shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry, Vermont, a small town about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Canadian border. Washington state resident Teresa Youngblut, 21, faces two weapons charges in connection with the killing.",
      "She was traveling with German citizen Felix Bauckholt, who is also listed in court documents as Ophelia. Both had connections to a cultlike group known in online communities as \u201cZizians\" because of their affinity for a blogger who calls herself \u201cZiz.\u201d The pair had been under the surveillance of authorities for several days after an employee at a hotel where they were staying reported seeing Youngblut carrying a gun.",

      "Many U.S. adults believe the federal government is overspending",
      "WASHINGTON -- Many U.S. adults believe the federal government is overspending \u2014 but polling also shows that many Americans, including Republicans, think the country is spending too little on major government programs such as Social Security.",
      "The polls from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research suggest that as President Donald Trump and adviser Elon Musk push for extensive cuts throughout the federal government, slashing funding for humanitarian aid and turning their attention to the Department of Education and the military, Americans may not agree with where Trump and Musk's cuts should ultimately fall.",
      "About two-thirds of Americans say the U.S. government is spending \u201ctoo little\u201d on Social Security and education, according to a January AP-NORC poll. Another 6 in 10, roughly, say too little money is going to assistance to the poor. A similar share say spending is too low for Medicare, the national health care insurance program for seniors, and most also say Medicaid is under-funded by the federal government. About half say border security is not receiving enough funding.",
      "The perpetual challenge for lawmakers is that although U.S. adults mostly think the government isn't spending enough on key issues and programs, they are broadly in favor of cuts to the federal budget. AP-NORC polling from March 2023 found that 6 in 10 U.S. adults said the U.S. government was spending \u201ctoo much\u201d overall.",
      "Foreign aid is one area where there is broad consensus that the U.S. is overspending. The 2023 AP-NORC polling suggests that Americans tend to believe too much money is going to other countries.",
      "Roughly 7 in 10 U.S. adults said the government was putting too much money toward \u201cassistance to other countries.\u201d About 9 in 10 Republicans and just over half of Democrats agreed that the country was overspending on foreign aid at the time.",
      "Richard Tunnell, a 33-year-old veteran living in Huntsville, Texas, said he believes the United States gets involved in other countries' problems too often. Tunnell, an independent who voted for Trump in November, is glad that Trump, a Republican, is prioritizing his \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies.",
      "\u201cAmericans need to worry about Americans,\" Tunnell said. \"There\u2019s atrocities happening on American soil just as much as there is on foreign soil. You know, if we can\u2019t clean up our own house, why the hell are we trying to clean up somebody else\u2019s house?\"",
      "At the same time, polling has shown that U.S. adults tend to overestimate the share of the federal budget that is spent on foreign aid. Surveys from KFF have found that, on average, Americans say spending on foreign aid makes up 31% of the federal budget rather than the actual answer: closer to 1% or less.",
      "On both sides of the political aisle, very few U.S. adults think the country is spending too much on Social Security and Medicare, according to the January AP-NORC poll. But there are bigger divides on spending for the military, border security, Medicaid and assistance to the poor.",
      "About one-third of U.S. adults say the federal government is spending \u201ctoo much\u201d on the military. About one-third say the military is getting \u201ctoo little\u201d funding, and another one-third say it takes in \u201cabout the right amount.\u201d But most Republicans say the military is underfunded, while slightly less than half of Democrats say it's getting too much money.",
      "Jeremy Shouse, a 38-year-old Democrat in Durham, North Carolina, said he believes government assistance programs for ordinary Americans should be as well-funded as the U.S. military is.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really a slap in our faces as Americans,\" he said, referring to the underfunding of programs like Medicaid, which he has needed to use.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes down to school, Medicaid, any type of government assistance programs, the money is just kind of not there,\" he said. \"Not like it is for the military or the Army.\u201d",
      "Strong majorities of Democrats say the U.S. government spends \u201ctoo little\u201d on assistance to the poor, education, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. They are divided on funding for border security \u2014 about 4 in 10 say the funding is about the right amount, while 3 in 10 say it's too high and about 3 in 10 say it's too little \u2014 and tend to say federal law enforcement agencies such as the CIA and the FBI are getting the right amount of funding.",
      "Republicans tend to want more money for border security, Social Security and the military. About 8 in 10 Republicans say too little money is allocated to border security, and about two-thirds say that about Social Security.",

    "story": [
      "Since President Donald Trump took office, immigrants in the U.S. illegally have changed their travel patterns and try to stay home, out of fear they could be deported",
      "HOMESTEAD, Fla. -- The day before President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, a dozen immigrant families came to Nora Sandigo's ranch to ask her to be a legal guardian of their children. Now they are insisting she come over to their homes to sign the necessary paperwork.",
      "It's a result of the many ways immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally have changed their travel patterns as many try to stay home as much as possible and avoid going to the homes and offices of advocates such as Sandigo. Many fear they could be caught up in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation after Trump campaigned on a promise of mass deportations and has terminated programs that had given immigrants a legal way into the U.S.",
      "In the past few weeks, Sandigo has received hundreds of calls from immigrant parents across the U.S. She said she has been in at least 15 houses where parents have filled out paperwork so Sandigo could sign documents on behalf of their children at schools, hospitals and courts if they are deported. The power of attorney also allows her to help the children travel to reunite with their families.",
      "\u201cNow people are telling us that they are afraid to go out on the street, that they are afraid to drive, that they are afraid that they will stop them on the street,\u201d said Sandigo, a 59-year-old mother of two daughters who lives in Homestead, a city of about 80,000 people south of Miami. \u201cThey have asked me to go to where they are instead of them coming to me.\u201d",
      "The White House has said over 8,000 immigrants who were in the country illegally have been arrested since Trump\u2019s inauguration  on Jan. 20. ICE averaged 787 arrests a day from Jan. 23 to Jan. 31, compared with a daily average of 311 during a 12-month period that ended Sept. 30 during the Biden administration. ICE has stopped publishing daily arrest totals.",
      "In Homestead, where many immigrants from Mexico and Central America live and work in nurseries and fruit and vegetable fields, some avoid the supermarkets and instead ask neighbors to do their grocery shopping. In front of stores like Home Depot, men no longer stand around looking for work. Others have even stopped going to Sacred Heart Church on Sundays.",
      "\u201cPeople have stopped coming, and when they come, they ask if the immigration officials came here,\u201d said Elisaul Velazco, the owner of a clothing store downtown. \u201cEverything is paralyzed. Sales have dropped by 60%.\u201d",
      "For years, Sandigo has prepared immigrant parents for the worst-case scenario: being separated from their children.",
      "Now she goes to those parents instead of having them come to her.",
      "One recent Sunday, she visited four houses and received documents involving over 20 children. In some cases, the children were born in the U.S. and are citizens. The documents do not provide her full legal guardianship or transfer parental rights, but simply allow Sandigo to make decisions on their behalf.",
      "Most parents fear if they do not name a legal guardian, their children will enter the foster care system, they will lose their parental rights and someone else will adopt their children.",
      "Julia, a 36-year-old Guatemalan woman who insisted she be identified only by her first name out of fear of deportation, waited a few minutes before opening the door for Sandigo as a group of people ran out the back door.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s me, Nora, the lady you phoned to come,\u201d Sandigo told her.",
      "Julia opened the door a crack, saw Sandigo and then came out. Julia explained her husband had been detained days earlier while in a van with other immigrants on their way to a construction job.",
      "After a brief conversation, Julia invited Sandigo, a notary and a volunteer into her small house.",
      "Julia recalled that eight years ago her first husband, also Guatemalan, was deported, leaving her behind with their two American children, now 18 and 11 years old.",
      "\u201cWe are afraid. I feel very sad with life because of what I am going through,\u201d said Julia, her voice breaking and her eyes getting watery.",
      "The notary asked Julia to show her daughter's birth certificate and explained the son is an adult and doesn\u2019t need a guardian.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want my children to be taken away from me. If something happens to me, I want them with me,\u201d she said before signing the power of attorney naming Sandigo as the legal guardian of the youngest.",
      "In the backyard of another home, Albertina, a 36-year-old Mexican mother, held her 2-month-old baby while explaining what she wants for her six children if she is deported. Albertina also insisted only her first name be used.",
      "\u201cI am very afraid that they will grab me on the road and take me away. What\u2019s going to happen to them?\u201d she said of her children.",
      "She asked Sandigo to take care of her two oldest daughters, 15 and 17, because they do not want to go to Mexico, while Sandigo should send the other four to her home country.",
      "Sandigo relates to the families she helps. A devout Catholic, she fled Nicaragua when she was 16, leaving behind her parents after the Sandinista government confiscated her family\u2019s farm. She is now a U.S. citizen.",
      "About 15 years ago, she began offering to be a legal guardian to immigrant children. About 22 children of deported parents have lived in her house temporarily since then. More than 2,000 children have been under her guardianship, although some are now adults. Sandigo said she has assisted hundreds of those children.",
      "\u201cI feel empathy for them, solidarity, love for God. I want to do something,\u201d she said."

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:58:15 -0500",
    "summary": "Two bottles of Kentucky bourbon autographed by Pope Francis have brought in thousands of dollars for charity",
    "story": [
      "Two bottles of Kentucky bourbon autographed by Pope Francis have brought in thousands of dollars for charity",
      "LEXINGTON, Ky. -- It sounds like the opening line of a joke: What happens when the pope gets his hands on two bottles of Kentucky bourbon? But it actually occurred and the punch line is heartwarming: the autographed bottles raised tens of thousands of dollars to help poor and sick people, as well as homeless cats and dogs.",
      "The plan was concocted by the Rev. Jim Sichko, a Kentucky-based Roman Catholic priest. He saw an opportunity to turn a signature Kentucky product, and his access to Pope Francis as a papal missionary of mercy, into a way to help those in need by auctioning off bourbon bottles signed by the pope.",
      "\u201cI understand that at times people say, \u2018What is this priest doing?\u2019 I get it,\" Sichko said in a recent interview. \"I think outside the box all the time.\u201d",
      "His unconventional idea raised about $30,000 when Sotheby\u2019s auctioned off two bottles signed by the pope, plus another bourbon bottle autographed by former Super Bowl-winning quarterback Tom Brady.",
      "The proceeds are being divided among organizations selected by Sichko. He presented the first check on Jan. 31 to Paws 4 the Cause, an animal rescue organization in Lexington, Kentucky. Other checks will help hospice care in his native Texas and a legal clinic in Lexington that assists immigrants, he said.",
      "The Catholic Diocese of Lexington, where Sichko is based, will use some of the money to help people in need.",
      "It all began several years ago when Sichko gave Francis a bottle of hard-to-get Pappy Van Winkle bourbon as a gift when the priest visited Rome. After that, Sichko routinely presented a gift, often Kentucky bourbon, when encountering the pope as part of his role as a papal missionary of mercy.",
      "Sichko is one of hundreds of such missionaries appointed by Francis. They are assigned to travel the world spreading kindness, forgiveness, joy and mercy to people they encounter. Sichko, 58, said he travels the world about 300 days a year as a missionary and evangelist.",
      "During a visit to the Vatican last year, Sichko carried with him two bottles of bourbon, but with a different mission. He wanted to spread good to others by having the pope sign the two bottles donated by Willett Distillery in Kentucky. The bottles carried special seals and contained Willett bourbon that had aged for 10 years.",
      "When the time came, he mustered the nerve to seek the papal signatures.",
      "\u201cI just pulled out the bottle of bourbon with a pen,\u201d Sichko recalled. \u201cAnd he looked at me and he signed it. And I was shocked. And then what I did was I pulled out the other bottle. And he signed that.\u201d",
      "Sichko wasn't ready for what happened next.",
      "\u201cHe looked at both bottles and he looked at me and he said, \u2018Father, which one of these is mine?\u2019\u201d Sichko recalled. That led to an uncomfortable confession.",
      "\u201cI said, 'Neither one of these are for you. I want to come up with a creative way to auction them off for the good of others,'\u201d Sichko said. \u201cAnd that's how it came about.\u201d",
      "Sichko's teammate on the project was Drew Kulsveen, the master distiller at Willett Distillery.",
      "\u201cFrom the first conversation, our door was open knowing this contribution can impact countless people in need through his work,\u201d Kulsveen said in a statement.",
      "Kulsveen and his wife joined Sichko on the journey to Rome. He called it a \u201ctremendous honor\u201d watching the pope sign the bottles of bourbon from his distillery.",
      "Sichko received a warm welcome from workers at the animal shelter when he arrived carrying a $7,375 donation. Anita Spreitzer, vice president and general manager of Paws 4 the Cause, said it would help pay for an expansion of the shelter that was underway.",
      "Part of the donation, however, will be passed along to another animal rescue group, she said. That brought a hearty approval from Sichko, who said, \u201cThat's the way it goes \u2014 give and receive.\u201d",
      "Sichko said he expects to return to the Vatican in about six months but doesn't know if he will ask the pope to sign more bourbon bottles.",
      "\u201cIt loses its flair if you're constantly getting him to autograph things,\u201d the priest said.",
      "Sichko said he hopes his work has a ripple effect, inspiring acts of kindness by others. It can be as small as opening the door for someone or letting someone go ahead of them in the grocery checkout line.",
      "\u201cEveryone can do something,\u201d Sichko said. \"It costs nothing to be kind.",
      "\u201cOur world is turning into a very angry world,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I think it's time that we just chill out a bit and recognize truly what we're called to be. And that is brothers and sisters. We may all have different skin colors. We may have all different ways of life. But I think we all come from the same place, and that is love and love of God.\u201d"

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A Texas man who murdered his strip club manager and another man, then later prompted a massive lockdown of the state prison system when he used a cellphone smuggled into death row to threaten a lawmaker, was scheduled to be executed Thursday.",
      "Richard Lee Tabler, 46, would be the second inmate executed in Texas in a little over a week, with two more scheduled by the end of April. He's set to receive a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.",
      "Tabler was condemned for the Thanksgiving 2004 shooting deaths of Mohammed-Amine Rahmouni, 28, and Haitham Zayed, 25, in a remote area near Killeen in Central Texas. Rahmouni was the manager of a strip club where Tabler worked until he was banned from the place. Zayed was a friend of Rahmouni, and police said both men were killed in a late-night meeting to buy some stolen stereo equipment that was actually a planned ambush.",
      "Tabler also confessed to killing two teenage girls who worked at the club, Tiffany Dotson, 18, and Amanda Benefield, 16. He was indicted but never tried in their killings.",
      "Tabler has repeatedly asked the courts that his appeals be dropped and that he be put to death. He also has changed his mind on that point several times, and his attorneys have questioned whether he is mentally competent to make that decision. Tabler\u2019s prison record includes at least two instances of attempted suicide, and he was previously granted a stay of execution in 2010.",
      "\u201cPetitioner has spent the last twenty years in the Courts, and see's no point in wasting this Courts time, nor anyone else's,\u201d Tabler wrote to the state Court of Criminal Appeals on Dec. 9, 2024, after his current execution date was set.",
      "Tabler's death row phone calls in 2008 to state Sen. John Whitmire, who is now the mayor of Houston, prompted an unprecedented lockdown of more than 150,000 inmates in the the nation's second-largest prison system. Some were confined to their cells for weeks while officers swept more than 100 prisons to seize hundreds of items of contraband, including cellphones.",
      "Whitmire led a Senate committee with oversight of state prisons, and said at the time that Tabler warned him that he knew the names of his children and where they lived. Whitmire, through a spokesperson at the mayor's office, declined to comment on Tabler's pending execution.",
      "The ACLU appealed Tabler\u2019s case to the U.S. Supreme Court last year, claiming he was denied adequate legal representation during his lower court appeals by attorneys who refused to participate in hearings at what they said was his request.",
      "The ACLU appeal argued that Tabler's attorneys ignored a psychological exam that determined he had a \u201cdeep and severe constellation of mental illnesses\u201d that had been ignored since childhood. The court refused to halt his execution.",
      "Tabler worked at a bar called TeaZers and investigators said he had a conflict with his boss, Rahmouni, who allegedly said he could have Tabler's family \u201cwiped out\u201d for $10.",
      "Tabler recruited a friend, a soldier at nearby Fort Cavazos, and lured Rahmouni and Zayed to a meeting. Tabler shot them both in their car, then pulled Rahmouni out and had the friend record a video of him shooting Rahmouni again.",
      "Tabler later confessed to the killings. During the sentencing phase of his trial, prosecutors introduced Tabler's written and videotaped statements that he also killed Dotson and Benefield days later because he was worried they would tell people he killed the men.",
      "Investigators said that before he was arrested, Tabler called the Bell County Sheriff's Office to taunt deputies about the murders, and threatened to kill more strip club employees and undercover law enforcement at the club.",

    "summary": "The surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate tariffs prompts questions over the possible impact on British businesses.",
    "story": [
      "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.",
      "Trump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.",
      "The UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.",
      "Analysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.",
      "The latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.",
      "The use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.",
      "Trump launches plan to target countries with new tariffs",
      "UK not planning to hit back at US on steel tariffs",
      "UK signals it will seek US steel tariff exemption",
      "Both the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.",
      "The president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\".",
      "VAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.",
      "George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.",
      "\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries.",
      "But he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".",
      "Fiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.",
      "But she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".",
      "She said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.",
      "But he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".",
      "Mr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.",
      "'Difficult to predict'",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "But in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.",
      "Caroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.",
      "She suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair.",
      "\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.",
      "Mr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".",
      "Senior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.",
      "\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\""

      "'Breaking point'",
      "Helio Santos, who is based in Stratford in east London, is another driver taking part in the strike.",

      "Alongside demands for fairer pay and more secure work, the union is calling for the introduction of safety measures for drivers such as rider ID verification, complaint tracking systems, and support for victims of assault.",
      "A spokesperson for Bolt said the company has committed \u20ac100m (\u00a383.3m) over the next three years to support safety initiatives for its drivers.

      "Two US lawmakers have strongly condemned what they call the UK's \"dangerous\"  and \"shortsighted\" request to be able to access encrypted data stored by Apple users worldwide in its cloud service.",
      "Senator Ron Wyden and Congressman Andy Biggs have written to national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard saying the demand threatens the privacy and security of the US.",
      "They urge her to give the UK an ultimatum: \"Back down from this dangerous attack on US cybersecurity, or face serious consequences.\"",
      "The BBC has contacted the UK government for comment.",

      "The request for the data emerged last week.",
      "It applies to all content stored using what Apple calls \"Advanced Data Protection\" (ADP).",
      "This uses end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored. Apple itself cannot see it.",
      "It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it.",
      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",
      "The Home Office said then: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\"",
      "Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\".",

      "\"If Apple is forced to build a backdoor in its products, that backdoor will end up in Americans' phones, tablets, and computers, undermining the security of Americans' data, as well as of the countless federal, state and local government agencies that entrust sensitive data to Apple products.\"",
      "The move by the UK government has stunned experts and worried privacy campaigners, with Privacy International calling it  an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals.",

      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",
      "Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products.",
      "WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has also previously said it would choose being blocked over weakening message security.",
      "But even withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based there."

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:54:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump wants US vehicles to be more popular in Europe, but it's a difficult market for them to crack.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?",
      "Italy's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".",
      "Or as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".",
      "Add cost to the question, and it becomes obviously why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.",
      "\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"",
      "Mr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.",
      "Yet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".",
      "In 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.",
      "This imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.",
      "\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.",
      "These disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.",
      "Trump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.",
      "Trump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.",
      "In fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.",
      "The automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".",
      "As such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.",
      "US carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.",
      "Meanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.",
      "After years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.",
      "Ford plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.",
      "Elon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.",
      "Europe is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"",
      "He also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.",
      "\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.",
      "He adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.",
      "Adding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.",
      "Mr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.",
      "Mr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.",
      "Not least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".",

      "The government has found a \"serious systemic\" issue in homes fitted with insulation under two of its own schemes since 2022 \u2013 and ordered installers to put it right.",
      "But that won't include 93-year-old Margaret Chappell whose work was done in 2021 and now her house is consumed by damp, black mould and crumbling plaster.",

      "Durham County Council said it was working closely with residents and the subcontractor to address the issues.",
      "More than three million homes in the UK have had insulation fitted under government schemes including 260,000 properties which have had solid wall insulation.",
      "In October, the BBC told the story of 84-year-old Tormuja Khatun from Luton whose house with unsuitable solid wall insulation had mushrooms growing on the walls and dry rot feeding off the floor joists.",
      "Since then the house became so dangerous to live in she had to move out. Her family has been warned it will cost more than \u00a3100,000 to fix.",
      "Mrs Khatun's insulation was fitted in 2022 so in theory should be covered by the government's promise of help - but they still don't know when the work will start and who will pick up the bill.",
      "Not long after this BBC report, the government ordered an audit by the independent organisation Trustmark of more than 1,000 properties that have had solid wall insulation. It found that in half of the homes audited the work had not been done to the required standard.",
      "The Minister for Energy Consumers, Miatta Fahnbulleh MP, told Parliament last month that the audit had found ''serious systemic'' problems. She said installers would be required to fix and pay for any problems.",
      "The energy regulator Ofgem is now trying to establish how widespread the problems are and has written to 65,000 households that have had solid wall insulation since 2022 under the government's ECO4 and GBIS schemes.",
      "But because the homes in Chilton were done under a different government programme, called the Local Authority Delivery Scheme, there is currently no plan to contact residents.",
      "The government said it was ''currently confident the quality of works under the Local Authority Delivery scheme was high'' but it would keep the situation under review.",
      "'Catastrophic scheme'",
      "Building surveyor, David Walter, has been inspecting insulated properties for 25 years. He assessed the damage at several of the homes in Chilton and said ''poor design and poor workmanship'' had led to rain penetration which was causing the damp and mould.",
      "In Mr Walter's view the properties were unsuitable for solid wall insulation and said it would have to be removed from all of the properties. He warned this could cost tens of thousands of pounds per home to fix.",
      "He said the cost \"could actually exceed the market value'' of each house and added ''it just demonstrates what a catastrophic scheme it's been.''",
      "'Somebody needs to act'",
      "Susan Haslam said she has been fighting to get the damage repaired to her late parents', Bob and Maureen's Chilton home ever since they died three years ago.",

      "\"We don't want to let them down, we want it to be sorted for them and for us,\" she said. \"Somebody is responsible and they need to act.\"",
      "The company hired by Durham County Council to do the work on Mrs Chappell's house, Tolent, went bust before the installations were completed.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump is sharpening plans to hit exports from countries that he says have trade policies that are unfair to the US.",
      "On Thursday, Trump signed a memo that instructed staff to develop custom tariffs for each country, taking into account features such as their existing tariffs, exchange rates, trade balances and other rules.",
      "In outlining its concerns, the White House said that tariffs imposed by other countries were not necessarily the biggest issue, singling out the European Union for other policies the Trump administration said put US exporters at a disadvantage.",
      "While big questions remain about the plans, the announcement is likely to kick off trade talks around the world.",
      "Which countries could be affected?",
      "The memo signed by the president asked that staff report back for a plan for \"reciprocal trade and tariffs\" within 180 days.",
      "Trump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said his team would be ready to hand a plan to the president by 1 April.",
      "Trump cast his plan for so-called reciprocal tariffs as part of his effort to bring investment to the US and boost manufacturing.",
      "\"If you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs,\" he said, adding that he was \"just doing what was fair\".",
      "\"In almost all cases, they're charging us vastly more than we charge them but those days are over,\" he said. \"This should have been done a long time ago.\"",
      "As well as the European Union, Trump's moves are expected to have an impact on trade relationships with countries such as India, Vietnam and Thailand, which have relatively higher tariffs and rely on the US as a big market for exports.",
      "Trump signed the memo ahead of a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has already taken steps to reduce tariffs on key items such as motorcycles, which Trump made an issue during his first term.",
      "Still, he vowed reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports at a joint press conference with Modi on Thursday: \"Whatever India charges us, we charge them.\"",
      "In recent days, officials in Thailand and Vietnam have also said they were reviewing trade with the US.",
      "Ahead of Trump's announcement, the European Union said it was committed to \"maintaining a close partnership with the US\".",
      "\"We will continue to seek constructive engagement,\" Olof Gill, the commission's spokesperson for trade said. \"At the same time, we stand ready to protect our interests.\"",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by the government. It is paid by the company importing the good.",
      "Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "Historically, the US has championed free trade and kept the majority of its tariffs low, except on certain products such as footwear and, more recently, steel and aluminium.",
      "The US has an average tariff rate of 3.4%, compared with an average rate of 5% in Europe, according to the WTO.",
      "In setting out its plans, the White House cited objections to tariffs such as the 10% tax that US-made cars face in Europe, compared with the 2.5% tariff the US applies to cars brought into the US.",
      "The White House also said that Brazil charges an 18% tariff on ethanol imports, while the US charges a 2.5% tariff on the same product.",
      "But officials made clear that the US intends to use tariffs to challenge policies farther afield, citing concerns about the digital services taxes many countries, including Canada and the UK, have unveiled against Big Tech firms - many of which are US-based - as well as Europe's rules for its Value Added Tax (VAT), a kind of sales tax.",
      "Those kinds of issues also raise risks for the UK.",
      "Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, a group representing transatlantic firms, said Trump's plans \"should not come as a surprise\"  and the details of how any reciprocal tariffs are calculated will be a key focus.",
      "\"Our hope at BritishAmerican Business, is that the UK's relatively open market and balanced trade with the USA gives it a chance to avoid much of the impact of this policy but nothing should be taken for granted,\" he said.",
      "What impact could tariffs have on the economy?",
      "Thursday's announcement comes after a string of tariff-related moves from the new administration.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump ordered the US to start charging a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium brought into the country, ending exemptions for countries including the European Union, UK and Brazil. That is due to go into effect next month.",
      "He also raised tariffs on all goods from China to 10% and threatened to hit imports from Canada and Mexico with duties of 25%, a plan that has been put on hold until March.",
      "Shares on Wall Street rose after no immediate tariffs were announced.",
      "John Cassidy, chief executive of Red Cedar Investment Management, said Trump's string of rapid-fire tariff announcements had unnerved Wall Street, which \"does not like the unknown\".",
      "But he warned against over-reacting, noting that tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term had a relatively mild impact on the US economy.",
      "\"I think Trump's playing a hand here and I think he's got a very strong hand to play,\" he said.",
      "However, Alex Durante, economist at the Tax Foundation, said it remained to be seen what changes could result from Trump's moves.",
      "He does not think tariffs are the best strategy for dealing with trade complaints, given the costs and uncertainty they introduce for US firms and risks of retaliation.",
      "\"I think we're inching toward more and more tariffs with each coming week and further escalation of a trade war with other countries,\" he said.",
      "He noted that Trump in his first term walked away from the Trans Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement that had been intended to address some of these same issues with countries in Asia.",
      "\"They were open to doing this without having to put the US through more trade uncertainty,\" he said.",
      "Trump has dismissed concerns about collateral economic damage, saying his plans will boost manufacturing in the US over the long term.",
      "\"What's going to go up is jobs are going to go up,\" he said. \"Prices could go up somewhat short term, but prices will also go down.\"",

    "summary": "Businesses want a review of the regulations that govern what Heathrow Airport can charge.",
    "story": [
      "Airlines and hoteliers say Heathrow's funding model should be reformed before any investment is made in the proposed third runway.",
      "Businesses want a fundamental review of the regulations set by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) that govern what Heathrow can charge. They say the current model makes Heathrow the most expensive airport in the world.",
      "If changes are not made, businesses say the third runway will not happen as it will be too expensive.",
      "The CAA said it would \"carefully consider\" conducting a review of Heathrow's economic regulatory model.",
      "A Heathrow source said that the airport management had already told airlines and the government that it would propose to look at a different, longer-term regulatory model for a third runway.",
      "But, as with other goods that consumers buy, those who use a service or product have to pay for the cost of providing or producing it as is the case today.",
      "Surinder Arora is the chair of Arora group which owns 16 hotels and lots of land around the airport. He is pro-expansion but he has his doubts it will happen.",
      "He told BBC London that Heathrow is overcharging for many items.",
      "For example, he says he pays 2.62p a unit for a unit of water at the Renaissance Hotel which is outside the Heathrow Airport boundary.",
      "At his Hilton hotel next to Terminal 2, within the boundary, he pays Heathrow Airport a lot more - 23.27p a unit. That high price is passed on to his customers.",
      "He gives other examples including three oak trees being chopped down and the airlines being charged \u00a376,000.",
      "A smoking shelter which he says would cost normally \u00a320-30,000, he says cost Heathrow \u00a31.1m.",
      "Sources at Heathrow dispute those figures.",
      "But he says the regulatory model allows Heathrow to charge what they want for many services, such as water, parking or construction, as they are a monopoly.",
      "\"The current monopoly at Heathrow doesn't only vastly overcharge passengers on aviation fees but also on their parking and a variety of other services as it continues to stand out as the most expensive airport in the world by a long way,\" says Mr Arora.",
      "\"We are delighted to be working with the airlines to ask the CAA to look more carefully at the regulatory issues which lead to such high prices and seize the opportunity for competition to improve Heathrow's offer to passengers.\"",
      "Most expensive for airport charges",
      "He told me without change the third runway would not happen.",
      "\"If it stays the same then it won't happen,\" he says.",
      "\"If you look at the last two decades they have never delivered a project on time and on budget.",
      "\"What they're looking at spending is \u00a362bn plus. And the current value of the airport is \u00a320bn.",
      "\"So what they're saying is we will increase the passenger numbers by 50% but we want you to pay three times than what the value is today. How can any business survive that?",
      "\"If they just carry on the same model, everyone else will end up paying for it.\"",
      "Nigel Wicking, chief executive of Heathrow Airline Operators Committee, says all of the costs are passed on to travellers.",
      "\"Heathrow is rapidly falling behind other major airports around the globe both in facilities and service to airline customers, while having the unenviable accolade of being the most expensive for airport charges. This cannot continue,\" he says.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:08:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Researchers have given a robot a powerful radio-based vision system which can see through smoke.",
    "story": [
      "If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, you're going to need some smoke.",
      "But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot.",
      "Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off.",
      "\"The whole building got triggered,\" says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. \"My student called me. He was very surprised.\"",
      "The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system.",
      "Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain \u2013 or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons.",
      "But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors.",
      "However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves.",
      "Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.",
      "But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.",
      "An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information.",
      "\"What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision \u2013 to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,\" explains Prof Zhao.",
      "He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building.",
      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

      "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the US, as he and US President Donald Trump agreed on a deal for Delhi to import more American oil and gas.",
      "Modi's two-day visit comes as Trump recently ordered that all the US'  trading partners - including India - should face sweeping reciprocal tariffs.",
      "While both men praised each other's leadership, Trump criticised India for having some of the highest trade tariffs in the world, calling them a \"big problem\".",
      "The Indian leader, seeking to soften impending trade barriers, said he was open to reducing tariffs on US goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military fighter jets from the US.",
      "At a joint news conference, Modi made several references to Trump's \"make America great again\" slogan, including his own spin to it: \"It's Make India Great Again - Miga,\" Modi said.",

      "With India already being reliant on imported oil, which it sources from multiple countries, the energy deal with the US \"presents a relatively low hanging fruit for both parties\", Radhika Rao, a senior economist at Singapore's DBS bank told the BBC.",
      "\"The US is the largest export market for India's goods and services, which underscores the administration's willingness to pre-emptively smoothen trade relations and offer concessions to narrow the bilateral trade deficit that the US runs with India,\" she said.",
      "However, \"India's challenge will be to balance its own trade deficit because US oil and gas might be more expensive due to a stronger dollar,\" Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies said.",
      "\"Reciprocal tariffs are likely to follow on India too at some stage. Hopefully for India, they won't turn out to be larger than expected,\" said Dr Palit.",
      "Trump also added that the US would increase sales of military hardware to India by millions of dollars, eventually supplying Delhi with F-35 fighter jets.",
      "The two also spoke about immigration - another pain point in bilateral relations - with Trump announcing that the US would extradite a man who allegedly plotted 2008 Mumbai terror attack to \"face justice in India\".",
      "Modi thanked Trump for allowing the extradition and vowed to accept repatriations of Indian nationals illegally living in the US.",
      "Last week, US deported on a military plane 104 Indians accused of being illegal immigrants, with a video showing deportees in shackles. A second flight is expected to land in India on Saturday.",
      "Indians are one of the largest populations of unauthorised immigrants in the US. They also hold the majority of H-1B visas - a programme that Trump had temporarily banned during his first term and is now coming under fresh scrutiny.",
      "Shortly before his meeting with Modi, Trump had ordered his advisers to calculate broad new tariffs on US trading partners around the globe, warning they could start coming into effect by 1 April.",
      "He acknowledged the risks of his tariff policy but argued the policy would boost American manufacturing and the country would be \"flooded with jobs\".",
      "Trump told reporters that \"our allies are worse than our enemies\", when it comes to import taxes.",
      "\"We had a very unfair system to us,\" the Republican president said before meeting Modi. \"Everybody took advantage of the United States.\"",
      "The White House also issued a news release that fired a trade shot across the bows of India and other countries.",
      "The document noted that the average US tariff on agricultural goods was 5% for countries to which Washington had granted most favoured nation (MFN) status.",
      "\"But India's average applied MFN tariff is 39%,\" the White House fact sheet said.",
      "\"India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.\"",
      "Trump has already placed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, citing its production of fentanyl, a deadly opioid that has stoked a US overdose epidemic.",
      "He has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days.",

      "But Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC that the UK had a strong case to avoid the border taxes, given the amounts Britain exported to the US were small in comparison to other countries and because the steel was used in areas such as defence.",

      "The government has said it would not retaliate immediately to new measures announced this week, despite many in the steel industry calling on Britain to join the European Union and Canada who have said they will hit back against the policy.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. However, for some suppliers of specialist products, trade with the US is much more important.",
      "There are also concerns within the industry that the tariffs might not only hinder exports to the US, but could also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",

      "Rachel Reeves and two colleagues were the subject of an expenses probe while she was a senior manager at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in the late 2000s.",
      "It was also revealed that the chancellor's online CV exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said Reeves has \"dealt with any issues that arise\" when asked about her CV by a reporter.",

      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed, it may not have concluded.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "BBC News investigates the Chancellor's expenses before she became an MP",

      "The prime minister was asked whether he was \"comfortable that she exaggerated her relevant experience\".",
      "He said the issues were from \"many years ago\" but that he and the chancellor \"get up every day to... make sure that the economy in our country, which was badly damaged under the last government, is revived and we have growth, and that is felt in the pockets of working people across the country\".",

      "Rachel Reeves has frequently cited her time at the Bank of England as part of the reason that voters can trust her with the public finances, and has repeatedly claimed to have spent up to 10 years there.",
      "The chancellor left the financial institution nine months earlier than she stated in her LinkedIn profile. This means she spent five and a half years working at the bank - including nearly a year studying - despite publicly claiming to have spent a decade there.",
      "On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the chancellor's profile claimed she worked at the Bank of England from September 2000 to December 2006.",
      "However, BBC News has established she had left by March 2006 when she began working for Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in West Yorkshire.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.",
      "They said the chancellor hadn't seen it before it was published.",
      "Speaking before the prime minister was interviewed, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir still thought the chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",

      "In a 2021 magazine interview, which she subsequently posted on X, she said: \"I spent a decade working as an economist at the Bank of England and loved it.\"",
      "In a speech to the Labour Party Business Conference in February last year, Reeves said: \"I spent the best part of a decade as an economist at the Bank of England.\"",

      "The claim was also repeated in a Labour party document last year which stated that she spent \"most of the first decade of her career at the Bank of England\".",
      "As she had already started at HBOS by the spring of 2006, her time at the central bank only amounted to five and a half years. This included nearly a year studying for a Masters at the London School of Economics (LSE).",
      "Last year, during previous controversy about Reeves's CV, the Bank of England confirmed that Reeves had left in 2006 but refused to give the month of her departure saying it was a detailed staff record which they couldn't provide.",
      "Reeves also stood for election in Bromley in south-east London more than three months after she had taken a job in West Yorkshire.",
      "She stood in a by-election on 29 June 2006 but had taken up a role at HBOS in March that year and received a relocation package to move from London. It is understood she rented a flat in Leeds and kept a flat in London at this time.",
      "The chancellor's online CV gives incorrect dates for her time at HBOS as well, which her team also acknowledged. It states that she left in December 2009, five months before she was elected to parliament in May 2010.",
      "In fact, we have established, her employment at HBOS finished in mid-May 2009, when she signed a compromise agreement. An invoice for legal advice on the agreement stated that it arose \"from a decision by your employer to terminate your employment\".",

      "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, according to official figures, despite analysts predicting it would contract.",
      "Growth in the quarter was driven by a range of industries, from pubs and bars to machinery manufacturers, having a strong December.",
      "However, the figures also indicated living standards last year were slightly lower than in 2023 on average.",
      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for sometime.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "The Bank of England has also halved its growth forecast for the UK this year, amid concerns that higher costs for employers could hit hiring, profits, investment - and push up prices. Last week, it decided to cut interest rates to 4.5%.",
      "Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the economy was \"all-but stagnating\" as businesses adjusted for higher costs and \"more uncertainty overseas\" - pointing to the introduction of trade tariffs in the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "He said it was a clear that \"a lot of the weakness\" in the economy was due to the rise in taxes on firms announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her Budget last year, with \"business sentiment on the floor\" and investment and consumer spending down.",
      "\"Overall, the economy is unlikely to do more than move sideways over the next six months,\" he suggested.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "But the latest figures showing a return to growth at the end of 2024 will be welcome news for the government, which has made growing the economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "A separate figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) measuring living standards fell 0.1% in 2024 compared with the year before. The measure - known as real GDP per head - calculates the volume of goods and services available to the average person in the UK and a person is deemed better off the more they have.",
      "When an economy grows, businesses on average have more money to spend to employ more people or give pay rises. Firms making more profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "All this together, in theory, leaves people better off - but it takes time for the benefits to be felt, and it does not necessarily benefit everyone.",
      "In December alone, the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.4%.",
      "Film distribution firms, pubs and bars all had a \"strong month\", as did industries involved in machinery manufacturing, according to Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS.",
      "However, this was offset by weak months in trade for computer programming, publishing and car sales businesses.",
      "In the construction sector, the final months of 2024 saw an increase in new work driven by new private housing projects, but repairs and maintenance work from private homes fell over the period, suggesting homeowners cut back.",
      "'People don't have the money'",
      "Sushma Solanki, the owner of Bolton catering firm Sushma's Snacks, told the BBC the economic situation was \"very worrying\" as she found trading at the end of last year very tough.",
      "\"I normally do about 20 to 30 Christmas office events,\" she said. \"Instead, I did two, which was very hard. People don't have the money.\"",
      "She said she had to let go an employee partly because of the upcoming rise in National Insurance.",
      "\"It's not just the policies, it's everything. Peppers for my chicken dish started off at 79p, they are \u00a31.85,\" she added.",
      "Chris Taylor, the owner of coffee shop Gran T's in Manchester, said he was \"shocked\" that there had been any growth in the economy.",
      "\"Going into last winter was one of the biggest struggles. I think a lot of people were naturally clinging onto their purse strings. Trade was not there,\" he said.",
      "\"This government's action plan, without hitting people directly with higher taxes, is hitting the level above and that effectively is going to hit people one way or another. It is really an indirect punch to the whole economy.\"",
      "Following the release of the new figures, the chancellor said she was still not satisfied with the performance of the economy.",
      "\"It's not possible to turn around more than a decade of poor economic performance in just a few months, but we are doing what is necessary to bring stability to the economy,\" she said.",
      "Reeves also said the government was going \"further and faster\" to \"put more money in people's pockets\".",
      "She also reiterated her self-imposed rules on borrowing and debt were \"non-negotiable\" after reports this week suggested the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, had downgraded growth forecasts.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Reeves's Budget was \"killing growth\" in the UK.",
      "\"Working people and businesses are already paying for her choices with ever rocketing taxes, hundreds of thousands of job cuts and business confidence plummeting,\" he added.",

      "Trump has said there will be no exemptions from the rules this time, either for individual products or for particular countries,  however some sectors are hoping he will row back from that position.",
      "2. Cars",
      "After Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium during his first term, carmakers including Ford and General Motors warned the measures would add about $1bn to each of their costs.",
      "For customers, Morningstar estimated the tariff costs back then would result in a roughly 1%, or a $300 price rise for customers.",
      "David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, warned Ford could be facing a similar cost increase this time, but said it was unclear how consumers will be affected.",
      "Affordability pressures in a market where sales have yet to return to 2019 levels could limit how much of the costs companies choose to pass on, according to Michael Wall, an auto analyst at S&P Global Mobility.",

      "3. Construction, housing and appliances",
      "The construction industry as a sector is one of the single biggest users of steel, which developers and homebuilders need for everything from building frames to appliances.",
      "Carl Harris, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said the decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium ran \"totally counter\" to Trump's stated goal of making housing more affordable, warning it would raise costs and deter development and rebuilding.",
      "\"Ultimately, consumers will pay for these tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" he warned.",
      "The National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs.",
      "After Trump imposed steel tariffs in 2018, appliance maker Whirlpool faced an unexpected $350m jump in costs it said was driven by the increase in steel prices.",
      "Companies unable to absorb such costs would likely pass them on through higher prices in the shops."

      "US inflation increased by more than expected last month, as higher egg and energy prices helped to push up the cost of living for Americans.",
      "Inflation rose to 3% in January, its highest rate for six months, and above the 2.9% expected by economists.",
      "The rise comes weeks after the US central bank decided to hold interest rates, saying there was significant uncertainty about where the economy might be headed.",
      "It poses a challenge to US President Donald Trump, who made tackling inflation a centrepiece of his election campaign last year, but has put forward policies, such as higher tariffs on imports, that economists say risk pushing up prices.",
      "Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the latest report could put pressure on Trump to reconsider those plans, which would raise taxes on goods entering the country.",
      "\"Tariffs can still be used as a bargaining tool to get some concessions from other countries, but the political optics of putting even a little upward pressure on consumer prices via tariffs wouldn't be great for the Trump administration,\" he wrote.",
      "The uptick in prices last month was wide-ranging, affecting car insurance, airfare, medicine and other basics.",
      "Grocery prices climbed 0.5% over the month, compared with 0.3% in December, as egg prices surged more than 15% amid shortages caused by outbreak of avian flu.",
      "That marked the biggest monthly increase in nearly a decade, the Labor Department said.",
      "Prices for clothing, by contrast, declined, while rents and other housing related costs increased 4.4% over the last year, marking the smallest 12-month increase since January 2022.",
      "Core inflation, which strips out food and energy and is seen by analysts as a better measure of underlying trends, was 0.4% over the month, the fastest pace since March.",
      "\"This is not a good number,\" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.",
      "\"It illustrates how the [Federal Reserve] has not completed the job of getting inflation back down just as new inflation risks - from tariff hikes and a squeeze on labor supply growth - start to emerge.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve raised interest rates sharply starting in 2022, hoping higher borrowing costs would cool the economy and ease pressures that were pushing up prices.",
      "It had started cutting rates in September, saying it wanted to avoid any further cooling.",

      "Has Trump promised too much on US economy?",
      "Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell told Congress this week that the bank was in little hurry to cut rates further.",
      "He noted that it remained unclear how Trump's tariff plans would shape the Fed's policies, since the measures could prompt a slowdown in the economy, alongside a rise in prices.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump called on the Fed to lower interest rates to go \"hand-in-hand\" with tariffs.",
      "But some analysts said after the report that they were no longer expecting any rate cuts this year.",
      "Wall Street stocks ended the day mostly lower, while interest rates charged on US government debt climbed as investors bet that borrowing costs would remain higher for longer.",
      "Meanwhile, Randy Kroszner, a former Federal Reserve Board member questioned whether prices would rise enough for Trump to change course.",
      "\"When President Trump was in office the previous time, he did raise tariffs on steel and aluminium and there was very little impact on overall prices,\" Mr Kroszner said in an interview with BBC News.",
      "\"So it's unclear whether this would be bigger this time. I mean if it does lead to sort of a global trade war, then they'll have a bigger impact. But trade is a relatively small part of the US economy. That's one of the reasons that President Trump has chosen to focus on this.\""

      "Goldman Sachs' vice chair has said the bank ditched an internal diversity rule that barred it from advising all male, all white boards on company flotations because it was no longer needed.",
      "The investment bank had pledged that it would only help a business sell its shares on a stock exchange if it had two board members that satisfied diversity requirements, one of whom had to be a woman.",

      "Reeves has said she wants to see \"spades in the ground\" before 2029 and planes to start using the runway by 2035, but Mr Woldbye has previously warned the project would take years and need \"Churchillian resolve\" to deliver.",

      "\"This Escobar merchandise benefits many families here - it sustains us. It helps us pay our rent, buy food, look after our kids,\" says Ms Montaya, who supports herself and her young daughter.",
      "Ms Montoya says at least 15% of her sales come from Escobar products, but some sellers tell the BBC that for them it's as much as 60%.",
      "If the bill is approved there would be a defined time period for sellers to familiarise themselves with the new rules and phase out their Escobar stock.",
      "\"We'd need a transition phase so that people could stop selling these products and replace them with other ones,\" explains Congressman G\u00f3mez. He says that Colombia has more interesting things to show than drug lords, and that the association with Escobar has stigmatised the country abroad.",
      "Some of the T-shirts, sold for around \u00a35, bear a catchphrase linked to Escobar - \"silver or lead?\".  This symbolises the choice the cartel boss gave to those who posed a threat to his criminal operations: accept a bribe or be killed.",
      "Shop assistant Mar\u00eda Suarez believes that the profit gained from sales of Escobar merchandise isn't ethical.",
      "\"We need this ban. He did awful things and these souvenirs are things that shouldn't exist,\" she says, explaining that she feels uncomfortable that her boss stocks Escobar items.",
      "Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel at one point were believed to have controlled 80% of the cocaine entering the US. In 1987, he was named as one of the richest people in the world by Forbes magazine.",
      "He spent some of his fortune developing deprived neighbourhoods, but many people consider this as a tactic to buy loyalty from some segments of the population.",
      "Years on from his father's death, Mr Rojas remembers him as a calm and responsible man, who loved his family. For him, the bill is a defining moment.",
      "\"It's a milestone in the road about how we reflect on what is happening in terms of the commercialisation of images of Pablo Escobar in order to correct it,\" says Mr Rojas.",
      "Yet he does have criticisms about the proposals. He believes the bill doesn't focus enough on education.",
      "Mr Rojas recalls a day many years ago when he met a man wearing a green T-shirt with a silhouette of  Escobar, and the words \"Pablo, President\".",
      "\"It caused me such confusion that I wasn't able to say anything to him about it,\" he says.",
      "\"There needs to be more of an emphasis on how we deliver different messages to new generations, so that there isn't a positive image of what a cartel boss is.\"",
      "Mr Rojas has actively been involved in efforts to reshape narratives around Escobar and the drug trade. Along with some other victims, he launched narcostore.co in 2019, an online shop that appears to sell Escobar-themed items.",
      "But none of the products actually exist and when customers select an item they are shown a video testimony from a victim. Mr Rojas says the site has attracted 180 million visits from around the world.",
      "In Colombia's Congress, the bill faces four stages it needs to pass before it can become law. G\u00f3mez says he's hoping it sparks reflection both inside and outside of Congress.",
      "\"In Germany you don't sell Hitler T-shirts or swastikas. In Italy you don't sell Mussolini stickers, and you don't go to Chile and get a copy of Pinochet's ID card.",
      "\"I think the most important thing the bill can do is to generate a conversation as a country - a conversation that hasn't happened yet.\"",
      "Medell\u00edn's mayor  - who was also a presidential candidate in the 2022 elections - has publicly backed the bill, calling the merchandise \"an insult to the city, the country and the victims\".",
      "In El Poblado, an upmarket area of Medell\u00edn popular with tourists, three Americans browse a stall brimming with souvenirs. One buys a cap with Escobar's name and face printed on the front. He says he wants a memento of \"history\".",
      "But for supporters of the bill, this isn't about removing Escobar from history, it's about erasing a mythical construct of him, fostering new ways to honour the victims he killed - and acknowledging the lingering pain of victims left behind."

    "title": "Germany's once-mighty car industry is in crisis. What will it take to fix it?",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:33:37 GMT",
    "summary": "With the economy a key factor in German elections this month, can the auto sector get back on the road to recovery?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
      "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
      "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
      "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
      "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
      "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
      "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
      "A high-stakes challenge",
      "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
      "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
      "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "Why more young men in Germany are turning to the far right",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
      "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
      "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
      "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
      "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
      "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

      "The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message.",
      "\"It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,\" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia.",
      "The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.",
      "\"I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,\" he says.",
      "Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media.",

      "\"Kindness is cool,\" says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers.",
      "Mr Dereniowski's videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money.",

      "Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.",
      "The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular?",
      "Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments.",
      "\"Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content.\"",
      "On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism?",
      "\"\"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,\" says Ms Cleary.",
      "Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out.",
      "\"I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,\" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 01:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump has proposed a sweeping set of tariffs. Does this mark the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs is intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as we've seen - be used as a bargaining chip.",
      "The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25% duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade.",
      "Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era?",
      "I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers.",
      "Meet the participants",
      "Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people.",
      "Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry.",
      "Trump's ambitions",
      "Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him?",
      "Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons.",
      "Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days.",
      "Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years.",
      "He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs.",
      "Retaliation",
      "DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals?",
      "JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.",
      "Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries.",
      "DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this?",
      "JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat.",
      "So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies.",
      "We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system.",
      "We need a new system.",
      "MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history.",
      "Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences.",
      "One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support.",
      "Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners.",
      "Higher prices",
      "DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices.",
      "MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually.",
      "Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices.",
      "One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children.",
      "Trade war",
      "DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims?",
      "JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products.",
      "But I want to go back to consumer prices.",
      "People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases.",
      "What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree.",
      "The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy.",
      "DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s?",
      "MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity.",

      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "'Not the ministry of fun': Troubling issues clatter onto Yvette Cooper's desk",
      "It is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them.",
      "Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago.",
      "JF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith.",
      "Equality",
      "DD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality?",
      "MC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers.",
      "If the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with?",
      "If the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war.",
      "So the spillover effects could be very, very negative.",
      "DD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth?",
      "JF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains.",
      "The world has grown through the success of industries. The US prosperity from 1900 to 1970 was due largely to the automobile industry. What you saw was huge productivity gains as Henry Ford and all his successors invented and developed mass production. You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world.",
      "So what we need is industrial growth and when you look at a national security framework, we cannot be dependent on China for as many goods as we are today. We are far too dependent on China here in the United States, Europe is far too dependent on China. So what's the resolution? Well the resolution is pretty obvious - we need to make certain goods here in the US.",

    "title": "How Spain's economy became the envy of Europe",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:43:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The growth is led by a tourism boom, with Spain nearing France as the world's most visited country.",
    "story": [
      "It's a chilly mid-winter afternoon in Segovia, in central Spain, and tourists are gathered at the foot of the city's Roman aqueduct, gazing up at its famous arches and taking selfies.",
      "Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovia's historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid.",
      "\"There was a moment during Covid when I thought 'maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before',\" says Elena Mir\u00f3n, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city.",
      "\"But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. I'm happy, because I can live off this job I love.\"",
      "Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the world's biggest foreign tourist hub.",
      "And the tourism industry's post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2% last year.",
      "By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2% in 2024, while France grew by 1.1%, Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by an expected 0.9%.",
      "This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the world's best-performing economy.",
      "\"The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth,\" says Carlos Cuerpo,  the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40% of eurozone growth last year.",
      "Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11% in one year.",
      "\"We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth,\" he adds.",
      "That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EU's Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to \u20ac163bn by 2026 ($169bn; \u00a3136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy.",
      "Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses.",
      "\"Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic,\" says Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spain's IESE Business School.",
      "Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, \"is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism\".",
      "Since Covid, the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost-of-living crisis triggered by supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 11% in July of that year, with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard, but by the end of 2024 it had fallen back to 2.8%.",
      "Madrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public transport use were key in mitigating the impact of the energy price rises, as well as several increases to the minimum wage.",
      "At the height of the European energy crisis, Spain and Portugal also negotiated with Brussels a so-called \"Iberian exception\", allowing them to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity in order to reduce consumers' bills.",
      "Mr Cuerpo argues that such measures have helped counter Spain's traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil.",
      "\"Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks \u2013 including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine,\" he said.  \"And I think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms.\"",
      "The country's green energy output is seen as another favourable factor, not just in guaranteeing electricity, but also spurring investment. Spain has the second-largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU.",
      "The latter is a boon for a country that is Europe's second-biggest car producer, according to Wayne Griffiths, the British-born CEO of Seat and Cupra. Although Spanish electric vehicle production is lagging behind the rest of Europe, he sees enormous potential in that area.",
      "\"[In Spain] we have all the factors you need to be successful: competitive, well-trained people and also an energy policy behind that,\" he says. \"There's no point in making zero-emission cars if you're using dirty energy.\"",
      "Despite these positives, a longstanding weakness of Spain's economy has been a chronically high jobless rate, which is the biggest in the EU and almost double the block's average. However, the situation did improve in the last quarter of 2024, when the Spanish jobless unemployment rate declined to 10.6%, its lowest level since 2008.",
      "Meanwhile the number of people in employment in Spain now stands at 22 million, a record high. A labour reform, encouraging job stability, is seen as a key reason for this.",
      "This reform increased restrictions on the use of temporary contracts by companies, favouring greater flexibility in the use of permanent contracts.  It has reduced the number of workers in temporary employment without hindering job creation.",
      "Also, although the arrival of immigrants has driven a fierce political debate, their absorption into the labour market is seen by many as crucial for a country with a rapidly ageing population.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has been outspoken in underlining the need for immigrants, describing their contribution to the economy as \"fundamental\".",
      "The European Commission has forecast that Spain will continue to lead growth among the bloc's big economies this year and remain ahead of the EU average. However, challenges are looming on the horizon.",
      "The heavy reliance on tourism - and a growing backlash against the industry by local people - is one concern.",
      "Another is Spain's vast public debt, which is higher than the country's annual economic output.",
      "Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros warns that this is \"an imbalance that we need to correct, not just because the EU's new fiscal norms demand it, but because it could cause financial instability\".",
      "In addition, a housing crisis has erupted across the country, leaving millions of Spaniards struggling to find affordable accommodation.",
      "With an uncertain and deeply polarised political landscape, it is difficult for S\u00e1nchez's minority government to tackle such problems. But, while it attempts to resolve these conundrums, Spain is enjoying its status as the motor of European growth.",

    "story": [
      "Schools across Stoke-on-Trent are caught up in an increasingly bitter row over repairs, with some telling the BBC they've had to fight to get work done while paying \"astronomical\" charges over 25 years.",
      "The city's schools are all locked into a multi-million-pound Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract, meaning they pay a company to keep their buildings in good condition.",
      "The agreement is due to end in October, when schools fear the private firm will walk away, leaving behind a huge repair bill for work not completed.",
      "BBC News has been investigating the row for more than a year, visiting multiple schools in the city, using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and analysing documents.",
      "We can exclusively reveal 42 of the 88 schools involved are now withholding payments to the contract. The investigation also found:",
      "35 of those schools received a letter from Stoke-on-Trent City Council threatening them with legal action in JanuarySchools were also told at the end of January that there was not enough money left to complete all the repairs required before the contract endsNone of the 88 schools in the contract have received any compensation for alleged failures, such as delays to repair buildings over the course of the 25-year contract",

      "None of the 88 schools in the contract have received any compensation for alleged failures, such as delays to repair buildings over the course of the 25-year contract",
      "The contract was signed in 2000 between Stoke-on-Trent City Council and a firm called Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited (TSSL). It uses multinational company Equans to maintain the facilities.",
      "The contract is the largest of its kind in England and will be among the first PFI deals in the country to expire. After the deal ends, the private company will have no further liability.",
      "What happens next has implications for the expiry of almost 600 similar deals covering schools and hospitals across England.",
      "Stoke City Council said its priority was to get the schools handed over \"safe, warm and dry\", while the main contractor engaged under the PFI contract, Equans, said the buildings had been well maintained.",
      "At Our Lady and St Benedict primary, more than half the children are from families on the very lowest incomes. When the BBC visited the school last month, part of one classroom was cordoned off with hazard tape because plaster was falling off the walls. There was a hole in the ceiling and the wall was damp to touch.",
      "The BBC has seen evidence the school has spent years chasing this and other repairs, which under the terms of the maintenance contract have to be done through Equans.",
      "Head teacher Sarah Clowes says the school's floors and windows are among almost 300 issues staff have identified - but the heating is her biggest headache.",
      "A new boiler, fitted under the contract last summer, broke down when the first cold snap arrived, and the youngest children had to be sent home for three days because the building was so cold. Pupils in Year 6 remained at school, but had to wear their coats during lessons. When the heating broke down again in January, the school was unable to open and all the pupils had to stay at home.",
      "Since the BBC approached Equans for comment last week, the damp plaster has been removed and repairs have begun. The school told us despite further repairs the heating is still not working in every classroom.",
      "A few miles away, at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy, the exterior render on the building is stained green with damp and is coming away in places. Inside, there is a huge stain where water comes through from the roof to the ground floor.",
      "The BBC has also seen evidence of months of delays to fix three pumps that supply the school with water. Only one is working - and if it breaks the school says it will have to close because there would be no clean water for taps and toilets.",
      "BBC News contacted Equans about the issue and the school has since been assured the pumps will be replaced during a school holiday.",
      "Ian Beardmore, chief executive of Newman Catholic Collegiate - a group of six primaries and one secondary in the Stoke PFI contract - describes the charges his schools have been paying for the past 25 years as \"astronomical\".",
      "He says the annual maintenance fee for a plug socket installed in one primary school staff room was \u00a3400, and when he asked for the socket to be removed the school was charged \u00a3500.",
      "Mr Beardmore says there are \u00a31.8m of repairs that need to be carried out across his seven schools, which have been identified in expiry surveys carried out to assess their condition as the maintenance contract nears its end. Some work has already been classed as too expensive or not essential, he says.",
      "\"There's no money, there's no will to do it, and there's no time in order to put these things into place,\" he says. \"It's going to leave us severely out of pocket - and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.\"",
      "The BBC has seen a letter, sent by Stoke-on-Trent City Council to all 88 schools in the Stoke contract, saying it \"remains concerned\" the PFI company \"may not have sufficient funding available to them to complete all of the handback works\".",
      "It will need to \"reprioritise\" work not already agreed, the letter continues, and target repairs which will leave all schools \"in a safe, warm and dry condition\" by the end of the contract.",
      "Schools have told the BBC it is not clear how these priorities will be agreed or by whom. The council subsequently said schools would be consulted.",

      "Investors make \u00a3140m from PFI deals",
      "When something isn't fixed quickly, or part of a school is out of use, these maintenance contracts allow for money to be held back from the private contractor. In this contract, Stoke-on-Trent City Council is responsible for making sure that happens.",
      "However, the BBC investigation suggests little money has been held back, despite concerns from the schools.",
      "The BBC analysed 25 years of published financial accounts for the PFI company TSSL and found \u00a3416,000 had been declared as deductions from the contract since 2014. In most years this was less than 1% of the fees.",
      "Using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, BBC News also found that no money has been passed on to schools for contract failures over the last 25 years.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council told us it was still working through these payments, and they would be paid to schools before October.",
      "The BBC shared its data with Ian Dennison, whose consultancy firm Inscyte is advising the schools fighting to get repairs done in Stoke. His company has worked on PFI school contracts across England.",
      "Mr Dennison told the BBC the level of deductions in Stoke were \"shockingly low\" compared with similar contracts for PFI schools across England.",
      "Time is running out for repairs to be carried out in Stoke's PFI schools and Mr Dennison is not confident the buildings will be handed back in a satisfactory condition.",
      "\"We believe that there's a really serious problem about to emerge around what works can be completed in time,\" Mr Dennison says.",
      "Putting buildings right at the end of contract is part of what the high yearly payments in PFI are intended to ensure.",
      "Inscyte says the expiry surveys carried out for Stoke City Council and TSSL show the total repairs would cost millions.",
      "The use of PFI deals increased significantly under Tony Blair's Labour government as a way of investing in public buildings without the government borrowing money up front. Under the deals, long-term agreements between the private and public sector were made.",
      "In Stoke, the contract mainly covered maintaining existing school buildings, with a bit of new build. Elsewhere, completely new schools were built under PFI.",
      "In 2018, the Conservative government scrapped the controversial PFI model after growing concerns it did not provide value for public money. But around 570 PFI contracts, including many to maintain and update school and hospital buildings, remained in place. Many are now nearing their end.",
      "Five years ago the National Audit Office (NAO) - which scrutinises value for public money - warned of a risk of schools and hospitals being handed back in a poor condition if the final stage of these maintenance contracts wasn't properly managed.",
      "As contracts begin to wind down, the NAO said there is a disincentive for the private companies to spend money before they hand over responsibility for maintaining the buildings to public bodies.",
      "In order to avoid this happening the government says \"expiry health checks\" should be carried out on buildings.",
      "In response to an FOI request, the Cabinet Office confirmed expiry health checks were carried out on Stoke's PFI schools in March 2021 and March 2024.",
      "Their condition was given the second worst rating, \"amber/red\", which means \"major additional work\" was needed.",
      "The BBC asked the council, Equans and TSSL to comment on its findings.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council said there had been a \"large amount of investment to maintain and improve these schools over the last 25 years\", which it claims means they are in a better condition than many schools elsewhere.",
      "The council said recent high inflation had made repairs more expensive, but it would not agree to responsibility for buildings being handed back unless standards set out in the contract were met.",
      "The council said more than half the work by value had been completed, and it was drawing up plans in case not all the work can be finished.",
      "Equans said it has been \"committed to ensuring Stoke's schools have been well-maintained throughout the 25 years of the contract\". It said an average of 28,000 jobs have been completed across the schools every year, with 93% of planned and preventative tasks being completed on time and, for the rest of this year, \"a busy schedule of work for the school holidays was planned\".",
      "Some work on the damaged render at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy is now due to be carried out over Easter, the BBC understands.",
      "Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited said the schools had been maintained \"in accordance with the contract\", adding that many of the school buildings were relatively old when it took over responsibility.",
      "It said \"all parties are working together to deliver the maintenance works by the contract expiry date\", adding that the schools were involved in the sign-off process and it was unaware of any dispute between the council and the schools and \"unaware of widespread issues with quality\".",

      "Long-term plans need to be drawn up for Scotland's schools to reflect falling pupil numbers, a think tank has said.",
      "The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there could be 90,000 fewer pupils in the country's classrooms by 2040 - and suggested that teacher numbers could be cut as a result.",
      "The group said this could eventually free up \u00a3500m per year, but the government has flatly rejected the idea.",
      "Teaching unions have hit out too, with the EIS saying cutting teacher numbers \"lacks any educational rationale\" and the NASUWT calling it a \"false economy\" that would damage life chances and Scotland's future prosperity.",
      "But when you consider the falling birth rate and demographic changes alongside the need to get the maximum benefit out of every pound spent on services, is it time to talk about teacher numbers?",
      "School staffing is a frequent topic of dispute between politicians - usually in terms of demands for more of them, not fewer.",
      "The SNP pledged in its 2021 manifesto to increase teacher numbers by 3,500.",
      "So when it was revealed in December that the figure had actually fallen, opposition leaders were quick to give the first minister a hard time about it.",
      "John Swinney pledged to get teacher numbers back to 2023 levels, and keeping them there is the government's new goal.",
      "But pupil numbers are already starting to plateau, and are projected to drop sharply over the coming decades.",
      "That's why the Institute for Fiscal Studies argues that perhaps it would be OK to allow teacher numbers to go down in line with that, rather than holding them at 2023 levels.",
      "The government has flatly rejected the report's conclusions.",
      "But much of the picture it paints is actually pretty positive.",
      "The IFS underlines that class sizes in Scotland are smaller than those elsewhere in the UK - averaging about 13 pupils per teacher, compared with 17 to 19 pupils per teacher down south.",
      "Spending per pupil is also rising, and is the highest in the UK - 20% higher than it is in England.",
      "But on both counts that can be explained in part by the number of pupils rising far more sharply south of the border. Scotland is set to have the opposite problem.",
      "The stickiest issue for the government is that these smaller class sizes and higher spending hasn't necessarily led to notably better outcomes.",
      "Scotland's struggle in international comparisons of school performance has been well documented. There has been a long-term decline in reading, maths and science, and Covid has hardly helped.",
      "The gap in attainment between pupils from more and less affluent backgrounds also remains stubbornly unclosed, almost a decade on from it being made the government's \"number one priority\".",
      "The IFS argument is that continuing to plough money into school staffing against a backdrop of falling school rolls isn't the most cost-effective way to improve things.",
      "Pupil numbers are projected to fall by 90,000 by 2040. If teacher numbers hold steady at 2023 levels, then the pupil-teacher ratio will fall closer to 12 - the lowest ever.",
      "But IFS research economist Darcey Snape says smaller class sizes \"only tend to have modest effects on pupil attainment\".",
      "Her analysis suggests that letting teacher numbers fall could free up funds - up to \u00a3500m per year by 2040 - either for other areas of schooling, or indeed for other badly-stretched budgets such as social care.",
      "Ms Snape accepts there would inevitably be \"practical difficulties\", like amalgamating classes and schools as rolls fall - but says local councils are arguably best placed to make these decisions, \"rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach across Scotland\".",
      "The latter point is already the subject of some dispute between schools and councils.",
      "Ultimately councils are the employers, and control the overall numbers - the government can only enforce its policy by holding carrots and sticks over them.",
      "Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth has clashed with council leaders by threatening to withdraw funding which was offered on the basis of keeping numbers at 2023 levels.",
      "A deal has just been struck with Glasgow City Council, which was planning on cutting 450 posts over a three-year period - which in turn had led to strike threats from unions.",
      "Groups representing teachers are predictably negative about the IFS's report, calling it a \"false economy\" and a \"race to the bottom\".",
      "The EIS and NASUWT say things aren't as straightforward in schools as the report might make out.",
      "Both make the point that the number of pupils with additional support needs has risen to record levels. They need more support, not less, and cutting teacher numbers would \"further entrench existing inequalities\" in their prospects.",
      "They also point to the fact teachers already have \"excessive workloads and working hours\", and face issues with anti-social behaviour and even violence in classrooms.",
      "It is absolutely fair to argue that long-term planning needs to be done, to take account of shifting demographics.",
      "The ever-increasing strain on care services provides a prime example of why we need to be ready for the ways in which society will change.",
      "Perhaps we do need to have a grown-up debate about the best and most cost-effective way to improve outcomes in schools.",
      "But when the headline is getting rid of teachers, it's always going to be difficult to sell the idea to politicians who face an election in just over a year.",
      "The Scottish government has already flatly rejected the idea, saying teachers play a central role in driving improvements in schools.",
      "And as noted above, opposition parties are chiefly interested in holding ministers to account on their promised increases. Nobody is going to put cutting teacher numbers on a leaflet.",
      "And it's particularly tough to get MSPs to stick their necks out when we're talking about something which will be an issue in 2040, which feels pretty distant.",
      "But a year is famously a long time in politics, and 15 of them is an eternity. Look back 15 years and Gordon Brown was prime minister and the SNP were being propped up by the Conservatives at Holyrood.",
      "If one thing is guaranteed, it's change; it's incredibly unlikely that we will reach 2040 with the current policy structure intact.",
      "Unless something also shifts in terms of Scotland's birth rate and the pace of demographic change, decisions are going to be needed sooner or later."

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 08:06:44 GMT",
    "summary": "After the star kicked two fans out, we speak to UK comics about the \"chaos\" and \"magic\" of heckling.",
    "story": [
      "Peter Kay made the news last weekend when he kicked two hecklers out of his show at the Manchester Arena.",
      "Kay defended the move afterwards, saying he'd done his \"best to address the situation and made light of it, as any comedian would, but unfortunately their interruptions continued\".",
      "One heckler was removed for loudly ordering the Bolton comic's favourite \"garlic bread\" one too many times. He went on to tell the Daily Mail he felt he'd been \"treated like a terrorist\".",
      "Another had announced \"we love you, Peter\" in the aftermath, resulting in Kay calling her Lisa Riley as she was ejected, because of her resemblance to the actress.",
      "The woman later said on TikTok that she felt \"humiliated\" and thought his reaction was a bit \"over the top\".",
      "BBC News journalist Ellen Kirwin told the BBC the \"vibe was good\" in the place before the red cards, which \"seemed unjustified\".",
      "The incidents prompted a week-long discussion about when piping up can be fun, and how it can quickly get out of hand.",
      "With this in mind, we asked an English, a Welsh and Scottish comedian for their thoughts on the subtle art of dealing with hecklers.",
      "'Most brutal heckle ever'",
      "Larry Dean, who starts his UK tour on Wednesday 19 February in Cardiff, tells the BBC he \"felt sorry for the audience, not just Peter Kay\".",
      "\"It's a really hard thing to do because no one wants to see a comic go serious, you feel like a teacher sometimes,\" he says.",
      "\"It changes the atmosphere when a heckler goes too far, but it really is about gauging do the people around me want me to keep going?\"",
      "Last year, Dean found himself the victim of what he has described as \"the most brutal heckle ever\".",
      "When discussing the topic of ghosts, he overheard a woman loudly talking to someone else in the audience and decided to ask if she was okay.",
      "\"My dad bought me these tickets because he's dying and he wanted me to have a laugh,\" came the reply.",
      "\"We're not laughing\", she added, \"so I've said to my pal we're going to leave.\"",
      "Dean recalls his shocked response.",
      "\"Obviously I'm not gonna make fun of that,\" Dean tells the BBC.",
      "The Glaswegian looked so discombobulated by the heckle that another audience member asked him if he was okay.",
      "\"Looking at it, perspective-wise, Chris Rock [who was slapped on stage at the Oscars by Will Smith) and Peter Kay - who have the two most famous show interruptions from the past few years - they've had it easy!",
      "\"They need to get this woman from Dundee to know what a heckle really is.\"",
      "His second-worst heckle involved a man on the front row repeating the same whispered swear word at him, so low that only he could hear it. \"I just had to ignore it,\" he says.",
      "Arenas, like the ones Kay performs in, bring in more people but they can also bring problems for stand-ups, he says.",
      "\"They're harder to play than a theatre or comedy club because the laughter goes up, it doesn't come towards the stage,\" says Dean, who has played support slots in arenas.",
      "He says it's difficult for comedians in Kay's situation to hear what audience members are actually saying, and that their interjections are also distracting for others watching in different parts of the arena.",
      "\"People say, 'he should have said this...', but usually people who say that have never been on stage before and they don't know how hard it can be thinking that quickly in the moment about what the best thing for the show is; because you just want everybody to have a good time.\"",
      "Another British comic James Acaster last year released a special entitled Hecklers Welcome, not because he particularly enjoys the experience, but to face his biggest fear and, as he told GQ, \"run towards the thing I was scared of\".",
      "Dean feels that \"nothing will ever catch people's attention more\" than watching a comedian get heckled.",
      "But, he warns, if you're going to take a pop at a professional then you have to expect something to come back your way.",
      "Heckling versus crowd work",
      "Abi Clarke, who has almost a million followers on TikTok, thinks most comedians will be on Kay's side of the argument.",
      "Crucially though, the Bristolian notes: \"There's a difference betwen heckling and crowd work.",
      "\"With crowd work a comedian is inviting it, you're asking a question, you're wanting a chat and that's very different from somebody shouting out a random thing.",
      "\"Once is fine, or twice but if the comedian stops engaging with you or says that's enough, then at that point you're ruining it.\"",
      "New comic superstar Paul Smith made his name roasting crowds as an MC/compere in Liverpool, while Jimmy Carr is also famed for inviting and actively engaging with interruptions.",
      "For Clarke, heckling comes into its own when comics are workshopping new material. If someone joins in, it can create new \"source material\" that can be used as a fresh joke at the next gig.",
      "\"I've had hecklers who have interrupted multiple times but if they're engaging, joining in with what you're saying and being positive, I don't mind that, it's quite fun.",
      "\"If they're just derailing the gig because they like the sound of their own voice, then I think you should just chuck them out!",
      "\"'Garlic bread' - there's not much you can do with that.\"",
      "'Spontaneous moments'",
      "Clarke thinks if you're going to someone's headline show that they've honed and crafted - \"they've perfected the rhythm, set-up and punchline\" - then the time to interject has passed.",
      "\"I promise you, It will be a better show if they get to perform it how it's meant to be performed.\"",
      "The other time that heckling comes in handy, she says, is for promotional purposes online, as comics don't want to give away their best written material for free, when a great bit of crowd banter will show off their skills just as well.",
      "\"The ones we will post are the wonderful one-off spontaneous moments because they'll never happen again, so they won't ruin the show.\"",
      "She's \"quite lucky so far\", she says, having had only \"two or three horrible instances\" of bad heckling, and in those cases the audience had her back.",
      "\"It's easy to win an argument against a person that no one in the room likes.\"",
      "Her new tour, Role Model, which kicks off on Thursday 17 April in Southampton, finds her keeping a humorous tally of bad behaviour, while questioning if she herself is a bad person for doing certain things.",
      "During these moments she finds other girls will supportively offer, \"no, it's fine\", which she really appreciates on a human level, but \"that's not what the joke is for!\".",
      "'Chaos and magic'",
      "Welsh comic Paul Hilleard, who won the BBC New Comedy Award last year, believes dealing with hecklers is \"part of the job\" and that Kay - a finalist in the same award in 1997 - may have \"thrown his toys out of the pram\" a bit, especially given he was playing to a room of \"people who love you\", he says.",
      "It's a bit different from some of the venues - or \"bear pits\" - that he plays as an up-and-coming comedian in Bristol, while also working as a teaching assistant.",
      "He sometimes performs in back rooms of pubs, where people don't always know that comedy is about to take place around them.",
      "\"Heckling is just part of the game, it's not fun... but it can be,\" he adds, mischievously.",
      "\"I've always been taught you've got to play the room. If it's chaotic, it doesn't matter if you've written the best 20 minutes ever, you've got to control that room of people who are intoxicated, and show them that you're funnier.\"",
      "Stag and hen dos, which tend to gravitate to comedy nights, can bring such chaos.",
      "Hilleard says he has spoken with other comics who agree that audiences \"are a little more feral\" since returning from the Covid lockdown, \"heightened\" by social media.",
      "\"One guy was on magic mushrooms, we found out, and it became part of the show, you lean into it,\" he says. \"That's the best thing you can do, until they become very abusive.\"",
      "\"There's a line,\" he continues. \"If you're ruining the show, that becomes the venue's problem.",
      "\"But it's our job as a comic to make that heckle part of the show, as that's where the magic is.\"",
      "He will perform at the Machynlleth Comedy Festival in May, and said there are \"tricks of the trade\" including certian \"jokes and comebacks\" that experienced comedians can lean on to deal with such situations.",
      "But it's all worth it, he says, \"if you can turn something on the fly that wasn't planned into something hilarous\".",
      "\"That's when people are like, 'oh my God, how did you do do that?'.\"",
      "Nine out of 10 hecklers, he believes, are not trying to ruin the show, they just think it's \"part of the fun\" or \"want to be acknowledged\".",
      "And the one that does, \"might have had a bad day, drank too much or they might just be an [idiot]!",
      "\"I think it's something within people, we like a bit of drama.\"",

      "\"I was in straight away, only 600 in front of me,\" wrote one fan on Reddit. \"I was able to find floor tickets for London even 30 min[utes] after general sale opened,\" added Shivam Arora on X. \"Not bad, to be honest.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's six UK dates at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London in June will be her first shows since 2023's record-breaking Renaissance Tour.",
      "Ticketmaster said prices ranged from \u00a371 to \u00a3950, but cheaper tickets were also available direct from the stadium's own website.",
      "The BBC was able to access Ticketmaster's page shortly after tickets went on sale at 12:00 GMT on Friday; and found tickets available in almost every section.",
      "The stadium map slowly greyed out as seats were snapped up - but prices remained static, suggesting that \"dynamic pricing\" was not in place.",
      "None of the dates were completely sold out at the time of writing, although in some cases only single seats remained.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's tour launched on a massive day for concertgoers - with tickets also becoming available for Ozzy Osbourne's final gig with Black Sabbath plus Kendrick Lamar & SZA, Patti Smith, Beck, Morrissey, Mumford & Sons, Razorlight and Smashing Pumpkins.",
      "One fan told the BBC they were willing to pay up to \u00a32,000 to attend Black Sabbath's charity concert in Birmingham, which will also feature performances from Metallica, Pantera, Anthrax, Gojira and members of Guns N' Roses.",

      "British Beyonc\u00e9 fan Ben Archer, who has attended all of her concerts since 2014's Mrs Carter World Tour, was among those who secured tickets. \"She is the one artist I'm determined to see every time she tours,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Eleven years ago, he paid \u00a360 for a standing ticket. This year, he paid almost four times that.",
      "\"If tickets had always been this expensive I wouldn't have been able to see her as often as I have,\" he said.",
      "\"I wonder if the increase in price leads to only the diehard fans (myself included!) attending at the expense of 'recruiting' potentially new/casual fans who may be willing to take a punt if it was cheaper.\"",
      "Going to major gigs is an increasingly expensive pursuit.",
      "Before the pandemic, the cost of getting into a concert was increasing by 3% to 4% a year, according to Billboard Boxscore, which tracks ticket prices.",
      "That number more than doubled when touring resumed, with prices increasing by an average of 9.9% annually.",
      "The last time Beyonc\u00e9 played in London, the cheapest ticket cost \u00a356.25, while \u00a32,400 VIP packages bought you a seat on the stage itself. An average ticket cost \u00a3139, according to figures from Pollstar.",
      "For this summer's shows, Ticketmaster says \"tickets have been priced in advance for the tour, ranging from \u00a371.60 to \u00a3950 (including fees)\", but that doesn't include VIP packages.",

      "For some tours, including Beyonc\u00e9's last one, prices go up as they are adjusted, based on demand, due to Ticketmaster's \"dynamic pricing\" scheme.",
      "That means fans logging on to claim a seat often don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll be charged.",
      "Fans fight back",
      "One person trying to combat the uncertainty is Fredrica Fekkai, a Beyonc\u00e9 fan from Washington, DC, who has been crowd-sourcing data on prices for the star's new tour.",
      "She said some people who had accessed a fan pre-sale in the US had paid well over the odds - sometimes by hundreds of dollars - but most seats in the UK were within the advertised ranges.",
      "Fekkai decided to collate the data after buying her own tickets for the Cowboy Carter tour. In her city, the ticket seller didn't have to advertise the base price or mark-ups, and she found the process overwhelming.",
      "\"I was on the page for hours, wondering what was a good deal,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I saw online [that] there was a lot of discussion on who was paying what, but of course, nothing was organised. I've worked in business consulting for years, so I'm used to finding the takeaways in messy information.\"",
      "After putting out a call on Reddit and TikTok, she received more than 1,000 responses from fans - and plotted the results on a graph to show the variance in price.",
      "She noticed that US fans who accessed a pre-sale through Beyonc\u00e9's \"Beyhive\" fan club often ended up paying more than those who went through pre-sales for sponsors like Mastercard and Verizon.",
      "\"The Beyhive sale had a lot of panic buying and/or increased dynamic prices from Ticketmaster/SeatGeek - I think both,\" she says.",
      "\"They see someone is willing to buy a $100 (\u00a380) ticket for $1,000 (\u00a3800), so they offer up that price again and again, and it gets snatched up,\" she theorises.",
      "Fekkai hopes fans will use her data to keep track of prices when the general sale begins, and avoid paying too much in the rush to secure tickets.",

      "Hollywood may be known as Tinseltown, a dream factory at the heart of the global entertainment industry. But nowadays crews are more likely to film in Atlanta, London, Toronto or Sydney than in Los Angeles.",
      "Cheaper labour and better tax breaks have lured producers away from the City of Angels for years. The wildfires, which killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes, have only added to this existential crisis.",

      "The Spanish actress has \"sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt\" and stepped back from the film's awards campaign.",
      "In a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: \"I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie.\"",
      "Speaking to The Town podcast, Bajaria continued: \"If you look at the nominations, and all of this awards love that it's received, I think it's such a bummer that it distracted from that.",
      "\"It really has kind of taken the conversation in a different way [from] this incredible movie that Jacques Audiard - who is an incredible director - has made.",
      "\"It really is a bummer for a lot of the people, like [co-stars] Zoe [Salda\u00f1a] and Selena [Gomez]. And in our awards team did an incredible campaign for that movie.\"",
      "The original tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.",
      "After they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context.",
      "Asked if Netflix would change its social media vetting process for actors on its projects in the future, Bajaria replied: \"It's not really common practice for people to vet social tweets that way.",
      "\"A lot of people are reevaluating that... I do think it is raising questions for a lot of people about reevaluating that process.\"",
      "She highlighted the logistical difficulties of implementing a vetting process: \"I think you also have to [ask]: Are we going to actually look at the personal social media of tens of thousand of people, every single day around the world, [given the] amount of original film and TV and co-prods that we make and licence?",
      "\"It raises a lot of questions about what that should look like.\"",

      "Gasc\u00f3n pulled out of appearing at several awards season events after the tweets came to light, and is not scheduled to appear at the Baftas on Sunday. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.",
      "In an Instagram post last week, the best actress nominee said she wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".",
      "She added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".",
      "Her statement followed an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.",
      "Netflix had not publicly commented before Bajaria's interview, but the streamer had altered the film's awards campaign following the controversy.",
      "Changing the promotional posters",
      "At this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.",
      "The movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.",
      "But the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.",
      "Previously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.",
      "But an updated FYC poster released last week almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.",
      "\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.",
      "The CNN interview",
      "Gasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.",
      "But she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.",
      "It has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".",
      "The fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.",
      "Often, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.",
      "Pulling out of events",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season.",
      "These included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.",
      "However, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued.",
      "And that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.",
      "The publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".",
      "It remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.",
      "What happens to the 'Fab Five' Oscars format?",
      "Many film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies.",
      "This sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.",
      "For example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.",
      "Traditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.",
      "However, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.",
      "Despite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy.",
      "Instead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.",
      "How could this impact Gasc\u00f3n's co-stars",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.",
      "It has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "It was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.",
      "After Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.",
      "\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"",
      "Later, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".",
      "Oscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.",
      "Meanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".",
      "\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.",
      "\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust.",
      "\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"",
      "After his comments, Gasc\u00f3n posted on Instagram: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"",
      "She also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".",

      "Rapper A$AP Rocky's assault trial is in full swing as his attorneys this week are mounting their defence against the charges that could derail his career.",
      "Pop star Rihanna, his partner with whom he shares two children, has been a repeated presence in the court as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times.",
      "The trial started late last month and will determine whether the rapper will face jail time on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison.",
      "A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the case.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in the heart of Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand last week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "What's happened in court so far?",
      "Prosecutors finished presenting their case before jurors as to why they believe Mr Mayers is guilty.",
      "Prosecutors showed jurors footage of the incident, captured on surveillance, that included audio of gunfire but no video evidence showing the shooting itself.",
      "There were a number of tense and emotional exchanges, especially when Mr Ephron was on the stand and testified about being shot.",
      "At one point while on the witness stand, Mr Ephron called A$AP Rocky's attorney \"annoying,\" which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another tense moment came when A$AP Rocky screamed in court.",
      "Another associate of the pair, A$AP Twelvyy, was being questioned by prosecutors on the stand when they showed him a photo of Mr Mayers' bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on furniture.",
      "When asked what the letters stood for, Mr Mayers interrupted and yelled out, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvyy would only say, \"It means AWGE,\" which angered the prosecutor, who asked the judge to force the witness to be more forthcoming.",
      "Mr Mayers' defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, has asserted the case was one of \"extortion, plain and simple\".",
      "Mr Mayers' lawyer said Mr Ephron's claims were financially motivated and suggested that Mr Ephron sought monetary compensation in exchange for dropping the charges.",
      "The trial is nearly at its conclusion. Mr Tacopina told the judge on Monday that they expect to rest their arguments on Tuesday.",
      "After his defence is finished, both sides will be able to give their closing statements before a jury decides the rapper's fate.",
      "Will A$AP Rocky take the stand?",
      "The rapper waived his right to testify on Tuesday, meaning that he will not take the stand.",
      "Now, it is believed that the trial will conclude without comment from the famous rapper. Closing arguments are expected to begin on Thursday.",
      "The rapper is not legally obligated to testify, and it could have been a risky move. Taking the stand would have mean he would face questioning from prosecutors as well as his own lawyers.",
      "Speculation that he would speak at his own trial only arose when his attorney, Mr Tacopina, stated that the rapper was \"eager to tell his story\", and that \"he would love the opportunity to do so\".",
      "Had he testified, the rapper was expected to argue that the firearm involved in the 2021 fight was a starter pistol loaded with blanks, carried solely for security reasons.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna continue to be in court?",
      "Rihanna has continued to appear at the trial.",
      "Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court that Mr Mayers had tried to keep his family away from all of this, but she has appeared multiple times during the trial to support him.",
      "At some points in the trial, she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom, media reports indicate. The couple's two children have not appeared.",
      "During Rihanna's first appearance at the trial, news reporters and fans gathered outside the courthouse to try to catch a glimpse of the singer.",
      "She ended up using a non-public entrance used by judges and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence had attracted attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",

    "story": [
      "\"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue,\" said Kendrick Lamar, a couple of minutes into his Super Bowl half-time show.",
      "Everyone knew what he was referring to. Not Like Us, his brutal takedown of rap rival Drake, was one of last year's breakout hits, earning one billion streams on Spotify and five Grammy Awards, including song of the year.",
      "But there were questions over whether Lamar would play it - or even could play it - at the Super Bowl, after Drake filed a defamation lawsuit for lyrics that branded him a sexual predator, which he denies.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song over and over during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric, in which he calls Drake a \"certified paedophile\".",
      "But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as Lamar prowled the stage.",
      "Drake's lawyers are suing Lamar's record label Universal Music Group over the track, accusing it of trying to \"create a viral hit\" out of a song that made \"false factual allegations\" about the star.",
      "Sunday marked the first time that a solo rapper had headlined the Super Bowl, and Lamar brought an elaborate stage show, full of dancers, fireworks and special guests.",
      "But the rapper's lyrics have always explored the contradictions between ego and self-doubt, and his Super Bowl set put that conflict in the spotlight.",
      "He performed on a giant noughts and crosses board, flipping between introspective deep cuts (typically staged inside the Xs) and crowd-pleasing chart hits (which took place in the Os).",
      "Actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, acted as emcee - berating Lamar when he became too self-indulgent, and praising his duets with R&B singer SZA.",
      "\"That's what I'm talking about,\" Jackson said, after the duo performed All The Stars, a ballad from the soundtrack to Marvel's Black Panther movie.",
      "\"That's what America wants, nice and calm.\"",
      "It was a caricature, critiquing the expectation that Lamar would tone down his act for the TV audience.",
      "\u201cToo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d scolded Jackson at one point - but Lamar wasn\u2019t prepared to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe revolution about to be televised,\u201d he intoned at the top of his set.",
      "\u201cThe picked the right time but the wrong guy.\u201d",
      "And whatever Lamar performed, the energy was electrifying.",
      "Early highlights included Humble and DNA, both taken from the rapper's Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN, and whose tectonic beats rattled around the stadium.",
      "The set, which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.",
      "Unlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isn't much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum - especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.",
      "SZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamar's edgier instincts.",
      "Not Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, \"yeah, somebody gotta do it\".",
      "He was joined on stage by the song's producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the world's baggiest jeans - before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, \"Game Over\".",
      "For fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs - including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies.",
      "Casual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jackson's plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadium's cavernous echo.",
      "And it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase \"end racism\" from the end zone of the football field.",
      "The phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests - for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.",
      "Many had expected Lamar to make a bigger statement, especially with President Donald Trump in attendance, but the star's performance remained resolutely uncontroversial - unless, of course, your name is Drake.",
      "On-stage protest",
      "Nonetheless, Lamar's show was sleek and streamlined - as many fans had expected, after audio of the backing track leaked on Thursday.",
      "The only interruption came at the climax of the 13-minute set, when a protester climbed on top of Lamar's black Buick GNX car and unfurled a combined Palestinian and Sudanese flag, before being tackled by security officers.",

    "summary": "The first K-pop boy band with North Korean members aims to debut in the US later this year.",
    "story": [
      "Yu Hyuk was just nine years old when he started begging on the streets of North Hamgyong, one of the poorest provinces in North Korea, nestled along the northern border with China and Russia.",
      "Besides begging, he ran errands for soldiers and sold foraged mushrooms. Sometimes he stole food out of sheer hunger: once he snatched a lunchbox that sat unattended at an underground station. Inside was a scoop of spoiled rice.",
      "This was just \"part of everyday life\" for many North Koreans, he says, adding that his own life was so consumed with survival that it left little room for dreams.",
      "But dream he did. Later on this year, the 25-year-old will debut in the US as a member of a K-pop boy band.",
      "1Verse (pronounced \"universe\") is made up of five members: Hyuk, Seok who is also from North Korea, Aito from Japan, and Asian Americans Kenny and Nathan - all prefer to go by their first names. They are set to make history as the first K-pop boy band to debut with North Korean defectors.",
      "From scraps to rap",
      "Hyuk was born in a seaside village in Kyongsong county and raised by his father and grandmother, after his parents broke up when he was just four.",
      "Later, his mother fled the North to settle in the South and reached out to him in an attempt to get him to join her. But he refused as he was close to his father and did not want to leave him.",
      "Hyuk says his family was \"not extremely poor\" to begin with, but the situation quickly deteriorated after his parents separated. His father didn't want to work and his grandmother was too old, so Hyuk was left to his own devices to survive.",
      "Eventually, his father persuaded him to join his mother, and in 2013 Hyuk escaped from North Korea.",
      "It took months for him to arrive in the South, after going through several countries. He has chosen not to reveal specifics of the route, as he fears putting other future defectors at risk.",
      "Once in the South, he lived with his mother for just a year, before moving to a boarding school with his mum's financial support. However, he struggled to cope with South Korea\u2019s fiercely competitive education system, as Hyuk had barely finished primary school before his defection.",
      "Writing was the one thing he found solace in, he says.",
      "He started with short poems alluding to his past life in North Korea. \u201cI couldn\u2019t openly share what I\u2019d been through, but I still wanted to make a record of it.\u201d",
      "At first, Hyuk believed his story couldn\u2019t be understood by others, but was encouraged by friends and teachers in his school's music club - and eventually found his passion in rap.",
      "Growing up, music had been a luxury, let alone K-pop which was something he had barely heard of. But now, he channelled his thoughts of feeling lonely and of missing his father into music, referring to himself as \u201cthe loneliest of the loners\u201d - a line in Ordinary Person, a rap song he composed as a part of a pre-debut project.",
      "Hyuk graduated from high school aged 20. Afterwards, he worked part-time at restaurants and factories to support himself.",
      "But it was in 2018 when he was featured in an educational TV programme that his luck changed. His unique background and rapping talent caught the eye of music producer Michelle Cho, who was formerly from SM Entertainment, the agency behind some of K-pop's biggest acts. She offered him a spot in her agency, Singing Beetle.",
      "\"I didn't trust Michelle for about a year because I thought she was cheating me,\" Hyuk says, adding that defectors are often targeted by scams in the South.",
      "But gradually he realised that Ms Cho was \"investing way too much time and money\" for it to be anything but genuine.",
      "'I thought North Koreans might be scary'",
      "Kim Seok, 24, also defected and arrived in the South in 2019, though his experience was vastly different to that of Seok's.",
      "Coming from a relatively better-off family, Seok lived close to the border with China and had access to K-pop and K-drama through smuggled USBs and SD cards.",
      "Due to safety reasons, we are unable to reveal much more about his life in the North and how he came to the South.",
      "Both boys were described by Ms Cho as \"blank canvases\", adding that she had never encountered trainees quite like them.",
      "Unlike Aito and Kenny, who had been immersed in music and dance from an early age, Hyuk and Seok were complete beginners.",
      "\u201cThey had absolutely no grasp of pop culture,\" she said.",
      "But their ability to \u201cendure physical challenges\u201d astonished Ms Cho. They pushed through gruelling hours of dance practice with such determination that she was worried they were \u201coverdoing it\u201d.",
      "Apart from music and dance lessons, their training also covered etiquette and engaging in discussions, to prepare them for media interviews.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they were used to questioning things or expressing their opinion,\u201d says Ms Cho. \u201cAt first, when a trainer asked the reasoning behind their thoughts, the only response was, \u2018Because you said so last time'.\u201d",
      "But after more than three years, Hyuk has made remarkable progress, she says.",
      "\"Now, Hyuk questions many things. For example, if I ask him to do something, he'll reply 'Why? Why is it necessary?' Sometimes, I regret what I've done,\" says Ms Cho chuckling.",
      "But what do the other two boys think of their bandmates?",
      "\u201cI was kind of afraid at first because North Korea has a hostile relationship with Japan. I thought North Koreans would be scary, but that turned out not to be true,\u201d says Aito, who at 20 is the youngest of the four.",
      "Kenny, who spent much of his life in the US, adds that there were also small cultural differences that have taken him time to get used to.",
      "\"Korean culture is very [communal] in that you eat together... that was a culture shock [to me]\", he said. \"I usually don't like eating with people, I prefer Netflix in my ear. But their joy comes from being collective.\"",
      "Late last year, the band added a fifth member, Nathan, an American of mixed Laotian and Thai heritage to the group.",
      "They aim to debut in the US later this year - a decision that the label hopes could attract more American fans.",
      "Playing one day - in North Korea?",
      "Dozens of K-pop groups make their debut each year and only a few, typically those managed by major labels, become popular.",
      "So it's still too early to say if 1Verse will go on to resonate with audiences. But Hyuk has big dreams, hoping that it might be possible one day for his fellow North Koreans to listen to his songs.",
      "With human rights activists often sending leaflets and USBs containing K-culture content via balloons and bottles towards the North, this may prove to be less of a pipe dream than it sounds, though Hyuk also has his worries.",
      "To avoid being seen as a vocal critic of North Korea, he refers to his homeland as \u201cthe upper side\u201d in interviews and avoids mentioning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "Kim has in recent years been ratcheting up his crackdown on the inflow of K-culture. Since 2020, the consumption and distribution of such content has become a crime punishable by death.",
      "A rare video obtained by BBC Korean last year, believed to be filmed in 2022, shows two teenage boys publicly sentenced to 12 years of hard labour for watching and distributing K-dramas.",
      "One academic says it would cause a \"stir\" in North Korea should 1Verse's music become a hit.",
      "\"If a North Korean defector openly embraced their identity and went on to become a world-class activist, I think that would cause a stir in the North,\" said Ha Seung-hee, an academic specialising in music and media at Dongguk University's Institute of North Korean Studies.",
      "But his main motivation, Hyuk says, is to prove that defectors can be a success.",
      "\u201cMany defectors see an insurmountable gap between themselves and K-pop idols. It is hardly a career option for us,\" said Hyuk.",
      "\u201cSo if I succeed, other defectors might be encouraged [to] have even bigger dreams. That\u2019s why I am trying my hardest.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "As a young boy, film editor Nick Emerson's fascination with 1970s American political thrillers, and watching the unfolding peace talks in Northern Ireland, set him on a path that would lead to him working on one of the most acclaimed films of last year.",
      "Conclave, starring Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and Isabella Rossellini, is leading this year's Bafta nominations, receiving nods in 12 categories, including Best Editing.",
      "The film is also thought to be a strong contender for the best picture award at next month's Oscars, and several of its stars, and Emerson, could also be in contention for individual prizes.",
      "Growing up in Lisburn, County Antrim, Emerson told BBC News NI that the talks which brought about the Good Friday Agreement gave him an appetite for this depiction of the election of a new pope, and the skills to put it together.",
      "\"Working in the BBC newsroom at the start of my career was a really exciting place to be,\" he said.",
      "\"There were a lot of peace talks and a lot of news.\"",
      "He describes Conclave - which follows a gossipy and scheming group of cardinals as they select the new Pope - in similar terms.",
      "\"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on... people with competing interests and competing ideologies.\"",
      "Emerson moved through the media industry, inspired by his experience in the BBC Newsroom in Belfast.",
      "\"I found myself doing factual TV and now feature films. Its the process, that's the joy of it for me.\"",
      "Conclave opens with the death of the Pope, prompting cardinals to gather in Rome to select a new head of the Catholic Church.",
      "But it comes with all the skullduggery, wheeling and dealing, and conspiracy one would expect, as the frontrunners try to improve their chances of becoming the Vicar of Christ.",

      "It's not the first time a papal conclave has been depicted on screen, and though the real world process is shrouded in mystery, there has been a number of notable attempts to dramatise what goes on.",
      "'Crisis of faith'",
      "Emerson told BBC News that he and Edward Berger - the acclaimed German-Austrian film-maker whose 2022 adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front was nominated for nine Academy Awards - aspired to make something that would replicate the 70s thrillers they grew up on.",
      "\"Edward and I are big fans of films like All The President's Men and we both thought: 'Wouldn't it be great to aspire to something like that?'",

      "Emerson and Berger's Conclave has pacing and visual storytelling that have been lauded for the way they create suspense and intrigue, as the camera often holds on a subject slightly longer than expected.",
      "Emerson said: \"In our approach Edward was really keen to push boundaries on how long we could hold shots and maintain rigour but also keep an eye on the pace.",

      "Kendrick Lamar's show-stopping performance at Super Bowl on Sunday was, for many, a victory lap following his knock-out blow in a long-running beef with fellow rapper Drake.",
      "The Compton star's entire half-time set seemed to swiftly build to a performance of Not Like Us, his Grammy-winning takedown of Drake which was one of last year's biggest hits... but is also now the subject of a potential libel case brought by the Canadian.",
      "Drake was performing in Australia on Sunday, dishing out cash to several of his fans at a Melbourne show, before the whole world tuned in to watch his rival.",
      "The origins of the argument go back more than decade. But here's a quick reminder of where we are now and how we got here over a heated 12 months:",
      "'The big three'",
      "In March last year, producer and former Drake collaborator Metro Boomin' and rapper Future released a collaborative album called We Don't Trust You.",
      "Hidden in the tracklisting was a song called Like That with an uncredited verse by Kendrick Lamar... and it was explosive.",
      "In it, Lamar took aim at rapper J Cole's previous claim - that himself, Kendrick and Drake were \"the big three\" - proclaiming: \"[forget] the big three - it's just big me\".",
      "After years of tension, the fuse had been lit.",
      "Three become two",
      "Soon after, Drake appeared to address Kendrick's verse at a concert in Florida.",
      "He told the crowd: \"I know that no matter what, it's not a [person] on this earth that could ever [expletive] with me in my life!\"",
      "Two weeks later, J Cole offered his own reply to Kendrick's verse, on a track called 7 Minute Drill, but he soon realised it had been a huge \"mis-step\".",
      "Speaking on stage at the Dreamville Festival in North Carolina, he apologised for the song, praised Lamar's back catalogue and asked for forgiveness.",
      "Boiling point",
      "Drake then released a song called Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50), in which he took aim at Lamar's height, calling him a midget (he's 5ft 4in tall) and a record label puppet who's forced to collaborate with pop artists.",
      "\"Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty / Then we need a verse for the Swifties,\" he cajoled.",
      "He also took issue with Lamar's position in the hip-hop hierarchy, suggesting other artists had overtaken him.",
      "More rappers, including Kanye West and Rick Ross got drawn into the feud. But Drake's attention was solely focused on Lamar.",
      "The Toronto star goaded his US adversary by dropping yet another diss track called Taylor Made Freestyle, which suggested Lamar was too cowardly to release music in the same week as Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department.",

      "\"Let me say I'm the biggest hater,\" he rapped. \"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress.\"",
      "Less than 72 hours later, he followed up with a second song called 6:16 in LA.",
      "In it, he claimed that someone inside Drake's organisation was leaking damaging information.",
      "\"You must be a terrible person/ Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it.\"",
      "Families embroiled",
      "In May, Drake shot back with a song called Family Matters, which took the feud to new heights.",
      "On the track, he speculated that Lamar might be a perpetrator of domestic abuse (the star has never faced such an allegation).",
      "Within 20 minutes, Lamar retaliated with a third diss track, Meet The Grahams, which opened with the ominous warning: \"You [messed] up the minute you called out my family's name\".",
      "Each verse was addressed to one of Drake's closest family members, listing the rapper's supposed failures.",
      "Among the claims, he said Drake had secretly fathered second child, and was addicted to gambling, sex and drugs.",
      "Drake responded on Instagram by asking whoever had his \"hidden daughter\" to hand her back, adding that Lamar's claims were a \"shambles\".",
      "But the Californian wasn't finished and he dropped a fourth diss track, Not Like Us, in which he accused Drake of having relationships with underage women.",

      "In response, Universal, which has been Drake's label for more than a decade said his claims were not only untrue but \"illogical\".",
      "It also accused the star of trying to \"silence\" Lamar, who shares the same label, by taking their rap battle to the courts.",
      "\"Throughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth 'rap battles' to express his feelings about other artists,\" the label said.",
      "\"He now seeks to weaponise the legal process to silence an artist's creative expression and to seek damages from [Universal] for distributing that artist's music.\"",
      "Super Bowl show",
      "Which brings us to the Super Bowl. A couple of minutes into his half-time show, Lamar said: \"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue.\"",
      "In the build-up to the big event, there had been questions over whether he would, or even could play it, legally-speaking.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric. But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game, as well as the likes of Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Taylor Swift, Sir Paul McCartney and Stormzy who were inside the stadium.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who reportedly once dated Drake and whose name seemingly appears in the lyrics of the song in question.",

      "In a review of the gig, the Guardian said the Pulitzer prize-winning rapper \"delivered the final blow to his diss track nemesis\".",
      "While over in the US, Variety noted how Lamar had quite literally declared \"game over\" in the battle.",
      "On Monday, Lamar announced a joint UK and Europe stadium tour with SZA, who joined him on-stage on Sunday night, which will take in Glasgow, Birmingham, London and Cardiff from July this year. Drake does not currently have any UK tour dates scheduled for 2025."

      "What's the Chitlin' Circuit?",
      "From the late 1880s until the 1960s, so-called Jim Crow laws enforced segregation against black Americans and saw them treated as second-class citizens.",
      "It meant that they were separated from white people - often prevented from living in certain neighbourhoods, forced to attend different schools and banned from public spaces.",
      "During this era, black musicians and performers created their own network of live performance venues across the United States.",
      "Known as the Chitlin' Circuit, it took its name from \"Chitterling\" - a dish made with pig's intestines popular in the south, where Jim Crow laws were most prevalent.",

      "\"The black stars of the day would travel the circuit,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat.",
      "\"It was very important to sustaining the careers of many important black performers - it allowed them to make a living in music.",
      "\"They were on the road all the time.\"",
      "Prof Bay says the presence of the circuit was also \"very helpful to black communities\".",
      "Performers were drawn to \"black vacation spots\" and the theatres at those locations, Prof Bay says.",
      "\"This would in turn help the careers of these entertainers,\" she says.",
      "\"It was one of the more successful segregation-era businesses.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 has often paid tribute to black performers, and Prof Bay feels the singer's Texas roots may have played a role in that.",
      "\"[It] was very much a segregated state, so this would be something that would be a very direct reference in terms of where she grew up and how she thinks about American history.",

      "For patients like Raymond, who has no family, hospital staff have become social workers - a point of human contact at a time when the social care sector is under strain.",
      "It's a dilemma for the medical staff, with 15-30% of patients at the Royal Free medically fit to be discharged but unable to go home, for a myriad of reasons.",
      "The hospital has its own discharge team - whose job it is to safely get patients out of the door, to free up beds for new admissions. Just under 14,000 people who are medically fit are still in English hospitals and can't go home, through no fault of their own.",
      "At the Royal Free London Trust, there are 275 people occupying beds who don't need to, at three major sites. That makes up nearly 20% of all the beds the trust has.",
      "Faye Rogers, on the discharge team, has been on the phone with a removals company. She's trying to get someone to visit the home of a patient to shift a wardrobe in the bedroom, to make space for an essential hospital bed.",
      "\"This is the kind of issue we have to deal with every day,\" she says.",
      "\"Sometimes a family member has the keys to a patient's house, and they've gone on holiday. Some patients forget the key code to their front door, so no one can get in. The problems are mundane and routine but make it difficult for people to be discharged and they're a regular occurrence.\"",

      "Then suddenly, an emergency alarm goes off. A patient in one of the wards is having a seizure. The doctors and nurses on duty, professional as ever, head straight for her bed, at least six or seven people. They need to get her to the resuscitation area fast, to save her life. But they can barely make their way out of the ward, because of all the patients in the corridor.",
      "A little later an ambulance drops off a man with mental health problems, who has cut himself in the lower abdomen with a knife. Despite the self-harm and his mental state, the ambulance staff tell the on-duty nurse that the outside mental health assessment service CASS, had refused to intervene, saying the patient wasn't in crisis.",
      "The duty nurse shakes her head in disbelief, writing down the details. Once again the Royal Free's A&E is being left to carry the can for another agency.",

A lot of patients are very dissatisfied with what's going on, and I don't blame them. We're doing our level best in the hospital to give them the best treatment and the best options, but you can only apologise so much.\"",

    "story": [
      "The amount of money the UK spends on health, predominantly on the NHS, has been rising for decades.",
      "And as the UK population ages and people demand access to new medicines and treatments, there is every likelihood that the national bill will continue to grow.",
      "So how much could the NHS ultimately end up costing the nation? And is it possible to get better value for the money we collectively spend?",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
      "How much do we spend on health?",
      "Shortly after the NHS was founded, in 1949-50, total UK health spending was around \u00a317bn in today's money.",
      "By 2023\u201324 it had grown to \u00a3226bn.",
      "Health spending per person in 2022-23 was around \u00a33,300 in England and Scotland, \u00a33,600 in Wales and \u00a33,500 in Northern Ireland.",
      "In the Autumn Budget last year, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced an additional \u00a326bn a year for the English health budget by 2025-26, which will automatically increase the resources available to the devolved nations.",
      "As a share of the overall economy - or GDP - spending on health has massively increased over the past 70 years.",
      "In 1949-50, health spending was only 3.6% of GDP. In 2023-24, it had more than doubled to 8.1% of GDP, after peaking at more than 10% in the Covid pandemic.",
      "Health spending jumped in the pandemic due to the costs of vaccinations and the \"test and trace\" programme.",
      "Around 80% of total health spending is funded by the government in the UK, mainly going to the NHS. The other 20% comes through private insurance schemes or out-of-pocket costs.",
      "That means health spending as a share of total government spending has also considerably increased.",
      "In the middle of the 1950s, health accounted for around \u00a31 in every \u00a38 the government spent.",
      "Today it's roughly \u00a31 in every \u00a33.",
      "How does that compare to other countries?",
      "Despite that surge in health spending in recent decades, the UK is by no means an outlier among rich countries.",
      "In 2022, using comparable data on public health spending, the UK was spending around 9.3% of GDP.",
      "That was higher than Canada (7.9%) and Italy (6.8%) as well as the EU average, but less than Germany (10.9%) and France (10.2%).",
      "The US was the real outlier, spending 14.1% of GDP on health, largely because America has a private insurance system with few of the cost controls of other nations.",
      "And those countries have, like the UK, seen health spending rise considerably in recent decades, driven up by growing demand for new medical treatments and ageing populations.",
      "What's going to happen to NHS spending in future?",
      "Last year, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's official forecaster, said there was every likelihood there would be continued upward pressure on UK public health spending, citing those same factors: an ageing population and more demand for new medicines and treatments.",
      "It also cites rising ill health among the population as one of the contributors to rising spending, albeit not the dominant one.",
      "The amount of health spending on an individual rises dramatically as they grow older. Average annual spending per person on those aged 45 is around \u00a32,000. For those aged 85 it is \u00a313,000 a year.",
      "The OBR projects that the proportion of the population aged 65 and over will rise from around one in five today to one in four by 2070.",
      "As people's incomes grow, research suggests they are typically willing to spend more of those incomes on healthcare, which in the UK is done mainly through the taxpayer-funded NHS.",
      "In its central forecast, the OBR projected UK public healthcare spending will rise by around 3% every year, after adjusting for inflation. This would be broadly in line with average growth over recent decades, although the rate has fluctuated under different governments.",
      "The OBR estimates this trend would add up to roughly an extra 1% of GDP going on public health spending every decade going forward.",
      "That would take public health spending from around 8% of GDP in 2024-25, up to 14.5% of GDP by 2073-74, equivalent to around \u00a3180bn in today's money.",
      "However, this would also depend on the long term growth rate of the economy. The OBR assumes public health spending will grow roughly twice as fast as the overall economy.",
      "If that path of spending transpired, it would also likely mean health spending accounting for an even larger share of total government public service spending.",
      "How do we get better value for money from health spending?",
      "Many politicians argue it's important for the NHS to deliver higher levels of productivity, in other words, to spend money more efficiently in order to keep the national bill under control.",
      "Productivity growth in the NHS has long lagged behind productivity growth in the rest of the UK economy.",
      "Last year, the OBR looked at what would happen if NHS productivity grew faster than currently expected in the coming decades.",
      "This, the OBR said, could curb the overall rise in public health spending. It might rise only to 11% of GDP by 2074, rather than to 14.5%.",
      "The recent indications of productivity growth in the NHS, however, are unclear.",
      "The latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics are that in the second half of 2024 NHS measured \"inputs\" - mainly in the form of more doctors and nurses hired - were 32% higher than they were before the pandemic in 2019.",
      "But measured \"outputs\" - things like operations completed and patients discharged - were only up by 7%.",
      "This meant that UK public sector health productivity was still around 19% lower than it was five years previously - and showing no signs of sustained growth.",
      "However, measuring productivity in the public services is far from simple and the ONS has stressed that these statistics are still only \"in development\".",
      "Other estimates from NHS England and the Institute for Fiscal Studies - the independent economic research institute - point to an improvement in productivity in hospitals in England more recently, suggesting a corner might have been turned in the delivery of health services after the shock of the pandemic.",
      "But regardless of the statistical discrepancy, most experts agree that improving productivity in the health sector in the medium and long term is an important objective. And the extent to which it is delivered will play a key part in determining how much the NHS ends up costing the nation in the coming years.",

      "White blood cells \u2013 which could produce antibodies or attack infected tissue \u2013 move out of their normal homes and head out on patrol thinking there could be an infection. So does this mean I'm more protected?",
      "\"Within a few hours that all goes back to normal,\" says Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh.",
      "\"There is no evidence that people who go cold water swimming have fewer colds or fewer infections.\"",
      "Cold water dips and swims: the benefits and risks",
      "Listen: Can you really boost your immune system?",
      "Regular exercise may give you a younger immune system",
      "There might not be the evidence for cold water, but regular exercise may well do the trick.",
      "On average adults get two to three colds per year and children between five and eight, says Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP and expert in evidence-based medicine, at the University of St Andrews.",
      "\"[But] people who do moderate amounts of exercise tend to report fewer viral infections,\" she says.",
      "There is a lack of conclusive clinical trials, but the data we have is \"all pointing in the direction of it being good for you\u2026 but not a miracle cure,\" according to Dr McCartney.",
      "Laboratory studies have suggested regular exercise may slow the ageing of the immune system. Your body's defences are in decline from our 20s onwards, but research on 80-year-old cyclists suggested they had the immune systems of people decades younger.",
      "\"I know the trials have not really been done in high enough quality, but I'm going to be doing a lot of cycling,\" she says.",
      "What about vitamins?",
      "The first thing that springs to my mind is vitamin C \u2013 either by devouring a mountain of oranges or in pill form.",
      "\"It's a no from me,\" says Dr McCartney. Being deficient may impair the immune system, but for the vast majority there is little to be gained from having extra. The same goes for multivitamins, which says Dr McCartney just make \"expensive urine\".",
      "However, the evidence around vitamin D is hotly debated rather than being a firm no. Vitamin D levels dip in winter as it is made when our skin is exposed to sunlight.",
      "\"I think the evidence is pointing towards possible benefits for people who've got respiratory disease and who are very low in vitamin D,\" says Dr McCartney, but there is \"insufficient\" evidence that it would help everyone.",
      "And while you're thinking what you might put in the shopping trolley, the jury is still out on whether prebiotics and probiotics that change the good bacteria in your gut also benefit immunity.",
      "\"I do believe that is a really important area of study, but we are lacking the real world data that would enable you to recommend this,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "She also says echinacea, turmeric and ginger shots are not going to give you an immune boost.",
      "Keep an eye on the clock?",
      "Your immune system's abilities are not fixed throughout the day.",
      "\"Our immune system is most effective in the early morning at around the time we wake up, continues to be highly effective through the early part of the day and then later on in the day it starts to wind down,\" says Prof Riley.",
      "This is why your cold often feels worse in the morning as your symptoms are the result of an immune system firing on all cylinders.",
      "The decline kicks in \"about four or five o'clock in the afternoon\", so you might have better protection if you are vaccinated, or exposed to someone coughing, in the morning.",
      "As the immune system does have this 24-hour cycle, then having  \"a regular daily rhythm\" rather than a mix of late nights and long lie-ins at the weekend \"may well help boost your immune system\", says Prof Riley.",
      "Stop damaging your immune defences!",
      "While we are thinking of boosting our immune system we should also remember there are things that actually increase our vulnerability to infection.",
      "One of the big ones is smoking because it directly damages the lungs so they are a less effective barrier to viruses.",
      "\"If you imagine the lungs like a sieve, smoking will break holes in the sieve, so more can get through,\" says Prof Tregoning.",
      "It also dials up inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation is like a thermostat for the immune system and is a normal part of how the body reacts to an infection.",
      "But \"uncontrolled inflammation is bad for you\" as it disrupts the immune system \"so you may respond less well\".",
      "Obesity is another factor that can increase susceptibility to infections as well as the severity by ramping up inflammation in the body.",
      "\"Both of those things can be difficult for people to stop or to reverse, but they are probably the most modifiable ones,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "Destress if you can",
      "Being constantly stressed raises levels of the hormone cortisol in the body.",
      "Yet, cortisol dampens the immune system which may leave you more prone to infection.",
      "Prof Tregoning says this may be the explanation for why being in nature, going for a walk, spending time with friends \u2013 even cold water swimming \u2013 may have some beneficial effect.",
      "\"You're less stressed, less cortisol, so therefore your immune system is more fit for the role it is trying to do,\" he says.",
      "Prof Riley adds: \"There is absolutely no doubt that being happy, being in a positive frame of mind, has a very, very important effect on our bodily functions.\"",
      "Stress: How to control it",
      "Squirt some salty water up your nose",
      "You have probably seen products in the shop that you can spray up each of your nostrils at the first sign of a cold.",
      "A report in the Lancet showed they do work.",
      "It gave thousands of people either a salt water (saline) spray or a gel-based one. They could use it up to six times a day whenever they felt they were coming down with something.",
      "People who just went about their daily lives without a nasal spray spent an average of eight days being ill during the study.",
      "But that fell to six days in those using a either salt water (saline) or a branded gel-based spray.",
      "Dr McCartney argues that a branded spray would be no better than a normal saline spray.",
      "So can the immune system really be boosted?",
      "If you are already doing all the usual things to look after your health \u2013 not smoking, eating healthily, exercising regularly \u2013 then your immune system is already in the \"best possible condition\" to respond to an infection, says Prof Riley.",
      "\"Can you do anything to boost above being a normal, healthy person? There's just no real evidence that you can,\" she says.",
      "\"But there are things you can do to improve your immunity against particular individual infections and that is to be vaccinated.\"",
      "And maybe instead of spending your money on the latest immune-boosting craze, she suggests thinking about ways of not getting infected in the first place so \"be careful who you socialise with\".",

      "Sir Keir and Zelensky spoke on the phone ahead of a global leaders' meeting at the Munich Security Conference.",

      "\"He was unequivocal that there could be no talks about Ukraine, without Ukraine.",
      "\"Ukraine needed strong security guarantees, further lethal aid and a sovereign future, and it could count on the UK to step up, he added.",
      "\"The prime minister reiterated the UK's commitment to Ukraine being on an irreversible path to Nato as agreed by allies at the Washington Summit last year.\"",
      "The leaders agreed it was an \"important moment to demonstrate international unity and support for Ukraine\" and \"agreed to stay in close contact\", the statement added.",
      "The UK has had to walk a fine line between its support for Kyiv and maintaining good relations with Trump, who this week agreed to open negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin while signalled his willingness to make concessions to Moscow.",
      "Trump's defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, has said restoring Ukraine's territory to where it was before the first Russian invasion in 2014 is simply \"not realistic\".",
      "Speaking at a defence summit in Brussels on Wednesday, Hegseth also downplayed the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato.",
      "His remarks were the clearest indication yet of the Trump administration's position on the Ukraine war and what a peace plan to end the conflict could involve.",
      "Ukraine has repeatedly called for Nato membership and has rejected ceding territory as part of any peace deal.",

      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy sat down for talks with US Vice President JD Vance on Friday, on the first day of the Munich Security Conference.",
      "Afterwards, Lammy said he was \"very encouraged\" by their conversations on Ukraine, and he and Vance were in agreement about Kyiv having a seat at the table when it comes to negotiating a peaceful end to the war.",
      "\"We share the view that there has to be an enduring peace,\" Lammy told Reuters news agency following the meeting.",
      "\"There was an agreement that Zelensky and the Ukrainians have to be part of that negotiated deal.\"",
      "Lammy said it was \"not surprising\" that Trump wanted to speak to Putin and Zelensky about negotiations to end the war, but added: \"These are just talks at the moment. We are some way from a negotiated peace.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Vance had said he hoped his discussion with Lammy would focus on what they \"spoke about a couple of years ago when we met, which is our shared belief that Europe really should take a bigger role in its own security\".",

    "summary": "The surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate tariffs prompts questions over the possible impact on British businesses.",
    "story": [
      "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.",
      "Trump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.",
      "The UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.",
      "Analysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.",
      "The latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.",
      "The use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.",
      "Trump launches plan to target countries with new tariffs",
      "UK not planning to hit back at US on steel tariffs",
      "UK signals it will seek US steel tariff exemption",
      "Both the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.",
      "The president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\".",
      "VAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.",
      "George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.",
      "\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries.",
      "But he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".",
      "Fiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.",
      "But she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".",
      "She said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.",
      "But he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".",
      "Mr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.",
      "'Difficult to predict'",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "But in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.",
      "Caroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.",
      "She suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair.",
      "\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.",
      "Mr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".",
      "Senior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.",
      "\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\""

      "As she had already started at HBOS by the spring of 2006, her time at the central bank only amounted to five and a half years. This included nearly a year studying for a Masters at the London School of Economics (LSE).",

    "title": "The Chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP",
    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:07:36 GMT",
    "summary": "BBC News has learnt that there was an expenses investigation into Rachel Reeves, and two other senior managers, when she worked at HBOS.",
    "story": [
      "Rachel Reeves has had a difficult start to her ministerial career.",
      "As well as Labour's new chancellor taking on the challenges of the UK economy, she has faced tricky questions about her past.",
      "They began with scrutiny of her online CV late last year.",
      "On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the Chancellor of the Exchequer claimed to have worked as an economist at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) immediately before becoming an MP.",
      "One of those who challenged it was a retired former colleague, Kev Gillett.",
      "In a public post on LinkedIn, which he asked followers to share, he wrote: \"Back in 2009 Rt Hon Rachel Reeves worked 3 levels below me. Just facts. She was a Complaints Support Manager at LBG/HBOS. Not an Economist. #factcheck.\"",
      "In fact it emerged that she had worked in a managerial role within the bank's complaint handling department and her LinkedIn profile was updated to remove the claim.",
      "Rachel Reeves's online CV exaggerated how long she spent working at the Bank of England",
      "Gillett also made another claim about Reeves's time at the bank from 2006 to 2009, writing that she: \"Nearly got sacked due to an expenses scandal where the 3 senior managers were all signing off each others expenses.\"",
      "Reeves's team vigorously denied the allegations.",
      "However, Labour's imminent victory in last summer's general election prompted a post on a private Facebook group for former HBOS employees that BBC News has seen asking if anyone remembered Reeves.",
      "One former employee replied: \"the expenses dept certainly do!\"",
      "Several others made reference to Reeves being investigated over her expenses spending.",
      "BBC News has been seeking the truth behind these suggestions, speaking to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues, and gaining access to receipts, emails and other documents.",
      "We have learnt that there was an expenses investigation into Reeves and two other senior managers.",
      "A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint and dozens of pages of attached evidence, which we have seen, raised concerns that the three managers were using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\" with allegedly inappropriate spending on dinners, events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.",
      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed it may not have concluded.",
      "But the initial part of the investigation, which was conducted by Internal Audit at the request of the bank's risk department, found that the three managers appeared to have broken the rules and the whistleblower's allegations were substantiated, according to a senior source with knowledge of the investigation.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "Banking career",
      "Reeves was in her 20s and trying to become an MP when she took up a job at Halifax Bank of Scotland in West Yorkshire in 2006.",
      "The role required her to move north from London, where she had unsuccessfully stood as Labour's parliamentary candidate in what had been a safe Conservative seat.",
      "She initially worked in the mortgage department, but in late 2007 moved to become Head of Business Planning in the Customer Relations department, which handled complaints.",
      "Her career at HBOS coincided with what would prove to be a tumultuous time for the bank.",
      "The global financial crisis which began in late summer of 2007 would force the sector to embark on a massive programme of job cuts and cost savings.",
      "In September 2008, HBOS itself came close to collapse, requiring a government-brokered takeover by Lloyds and an emergency bailout which would total \u00a320.5bn of taxpayers' money.",
      "It was shortly after this near-collapse, by early 2009, that a whistleblower from her department raised concerns about the spending habits of Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was Reeves's boss.",
      "Reeves says she won't let critics get her down",
      "MPs raise questions about Rachel Reeves's CV",
      "Rachel Reeves: Playing Labour's first big gambit",
      "Before this, in late 2008, a memo was circulated to Reeves and others which called for tighter cost control in the department.",
      "Written by a planning and strategy manager, the document, \"Financial Risk Control within Customer Relations\", raised concerns about \"spending on travel\" and on corporate spending cards, including Motivation cards which were used to reward staff.",
      "It laid out proposals to \"improve cost controls\" which included monthly discussions with Reeves and another of the senior managers who the whistleblower claimed had mis-used expenses to \"give visibility of claims, invoices, Thanks card use and reports\".",
      "Separately, Reeves was emailed in mid-December 2008 about proposals for a presentation setting out how much had been spent on Motivation cards, recognising top performers and on taxi travel, to \"focus attention on particular aspects of travel that are costly and perhaps need more consideration\".",
      "Reeves replied to say that she was not sure a \"huge analysis\" was needed and she wanted to see the papers before they went any further.",
      "Whistleblower complaint and investigation",
      "The whistleblower's complaint submitted by early 2009 was a six-page document laying out a range of concerns about an alleged spending culture in the Customer Relations department.",
      "It focused on the behaviour of three individuals: Reeves, Reeves's boss, and another senior manager in the department. Reeves's boss, who we are not naming, was responsible for signing off the expenses of the other two managers.",
      "The report and attached receipts and other documents seen by BBC News show Reeves was accused of spending hundreds of pounds on handbags, perfume, earrings and wine for colleagues, including one gift for her boss. Concern was also expressed about her spending on taxis and on a Christmas party. The whistleblower believed the spending to be excessive.",
      "After a call to the whistleblowing hotline, the whistleblower was instructed to hand in a physical copy of their report and supporting evidence, two sources said.",
      "A separate source, who contacted BBC News themselves in the wake of an article on the furore around Reeves's CV last year, was also aware that someone had blown the whistle on Reeves and another colleague.",
      "The report was passed to the bank's risk department and, at their request, was taken on by the Internal Audit department.",
      "A source who worked in risk at the bank told us: \"Given the nature of the allegations \u2013 claiming expenses for things you wouldn't normally claim expenses for \u2013 and the relative seniority of the individuals, the matter was referred for investigation by a team outside of that department.\"",
      "The Internal Audit department, which had access to expenses claims and sign-offs, then assessed the complaint and supporting documents, according to two sources.",
      "It found that there was evidence of apparent wrongdoing by the three senior managers including Reeves, a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation told BBC News.",
      "Internal Audit completed its involvement in the investigation and passed its findings to an investigative part of the Risk department in around April 2009. The normal process would then have been for the managers to be interviewed about the allegations. There would then be an assessment of potential disciplinary action if necessary.",
      "However it does not appear that this next interview stage took place, or that the investigation ever reached a formal conclusion. Reeves insisted she was never interviewed, as did her boss, who said she was \"not aware of an expenses probe and my departure was not related to any alleged investigation\". The other senior manager declined to comment.",
      "There is no evidence of which we are aware that the bank's internal investigation was completed, or that there was ever a concluding finding of any wrongdoing.",
      "Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.",
      "There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor left the bank on good terms.",
      "They also provided a statement from the lawyer who provided legal advice on the compromise agreement - a voluntary legal document ending an employee's employment - she signed on her departure.",
      "He said it was a \"standard-style agreement adopted by the company when a mutually agreed exit was made during the bank's restructure\".",
      "\"Absolutely no allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct were mentioned by the HBOS HR team during this process,\" he said.",
      "Expenses allegations",
      "What lay behind the whistleblower's complaint and the grumbles of other colleagues was unhappiness relating to several different areas of spending.",
      "One concern was the use of bank payment cards to pay for Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "\"A culture developed among senior managers in Customer Relations where gifts were given freely to direct reports  - both upwards and downwards,\" one former colleague of Reeves claimed.",
      "\"[They had] a very cavalier attitude regarding the budget in the department.\"",
      "Reeves and the other senior managers had both a corporate credit card and another payment card known as a 'Motivation' or 'Thanks' card.",
      "The Motivation card was intended to be used to reward high-performers for good work.",
      "There was guidance about its use. In February 2008 a memo instructed HBOS employees on the correct use of Motivation cards, which were widely used within the Customer Relations department.",
      "It stated that the cards were to be used to \"reward/acknowledge colleagues who have gone the extra mile\".",
      "Suggested gifts included \"chocolates, flowers, wine, vouchers or you could simply log on and send a free e-card to say 'Thanks' for a job well done\", the memo said.",
      "It warned that managers would be \"responsible for all transactions on your card and will be held accountable if spending on your statement cannot be verified\".",
      "Spending in this area was scrutinised because the company incurred tax on it.",
      "The memo doesn't explicitly prohibit Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "But 11 former employees told us they had never heard of colleagues being bought birthday gifts with the bank's money, and believed that doing so was in breach of the rules. Several said any birthday gifts were bought with their own money.",
      "However, one ex-staff member, Jane Wayper, a former HR business partner who was given permission to speak to us by Reeves's team, claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\" and \"staff were encouraged to do so for their teams\".",
      "Reeves bought birthday presents for colleagues with HBOS's money throughout her time in Customer Relations, receipts show, with purchases including wine and cosmetics. Some were bought using a Motivation card, while others were reimbursed through an expenses claim.",
      "She also spent \u00a3152 on a handbag and perfume as a present for her boss using the bank's money, according to the whistleblower's report. The present was a joint gift from Reeves and one of the other managers who was later investigated alongside her.",
      "And she bought earrings as a present for her PA, which she claimed back on expenses.",
      "Her PA, Linda Barrowclough, said she had received Christmas and birthday gifts from Reeves but had assumed they were \"personal gifts [and] they'd have come out of her own pocket\".",
      "Reeves also used her Motivation card to spend more than \u00a3400 on a leaving meal for a colleague, which the whistleblowing complaint claimed was not a permitted use.",
      "Christmas gifts",
      "The situation around Christmas gifts, which Reeves also bought for her PA and others, was more complicated.",
      "That's because, according to internal bank guidance we have seen, these could be bought on expenses providing they were small gifts of \u00a325 or less and they were not bought using the Motivation card.",
      "The \u00a325 limit was based on tax advice as anything more substantial would attract tax.",
      "It appeared to her colleagues that Reeves had broken these rules.",
      "But there does appear to have been confusion about the policy. We have also seen emails showing that Reeves was encouraged by her boss to buy more expensive Christmas presents, and to pay for them with her Motivation card.",
      "In late October 2008, Reeves's manager wrote that \"after checking with other departments, it looks like the standard practice of buying\u202fChristmas\u202fgifts for direct reports using motivation bank will continue this year\", emails seen by the BBC show.",
      "She suggested spending \u00a350 to \u00a375 per person on the presents.",
      "A reminder titled \"further clarity\" about how to buy Christmas gifts and how much to spend was circulated by another HBOS employee in early December, emails show.",
      "Reeves and the other managers who were later investigated were all among the recipients of this email confirming the rules on Christmas gifts.",
      "While seasonal gifts, such as at Christmas, were allowed, the managers were explicitly told they could not use Motivation cards for these purchases. The cost of these \"trivial\" gifts was also not allowed to exceed \u00a325, in line with\u202fHMRC guidance, the email said.",
      "This is because rewards for performance at work are taxable whereas seasonal gifts such as those given for Christmas, providing they are not too costly, are exempt.",
      "Replying to the email, Reeves wrote that she didn't understand why the \"goal posts are shifting\" and said she had already ordered and paid for her presents using \"Motivation Bank/Thanks, and I do not intend to cancel them,\" claiming this would cost more time and money.",
      "A colleague responsible for finance acknowledged that the message on paying for Christmas gifts hadn't always been clear but said: \"I don't believe that the goalposts are being moved.\"",
      "Receipts show that gifts bought by Reeves at Christmas 2008 included a \u00a349 handbag for her PA, while she herself received \u00a355 worth of wine from her boss.",
      "Open secret?",
      "There was a widespread belief at the bank that there had been an expenses investigation into Reeves and two colleagues.",
      "But Reeves has said that she has no recollection of being investigated or having questions raised over her expenses.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said she was \"proud of the work she did at HBOS\" and was not aware of the claims about her expenses until approached by the BBC.",
      "\"She was not aware of an investigation nor was she interviewed, and she did not face any disciplinary action on this or any other matters. All expenses were submitted and signed off in the proper way,\" she said.",
      "The spokesman also said Reeves left in 2009 \"on good terms and received a severance payment, including her full notice pay and bonus\".",
      "\"HBOS allowed her to keep a company car for six months after she left and she was given a favourable reference.\"",
      "Reeves's team put forward several former HBOS employees for interview who they said corroborated her account that she had not been investigated.",
      "One said she hadn't seen evidence of senior managers misusing expenses and the bank had controls to prevent it but she left in February 2008, more than a year before Reeves departed. She also said that she had never heard of giving birthday and Christmas gifts at HBOS's expense as being part of the bank's policies.",
      "Another, Jane Wayper, the former HR business partner, said in a statement that she didn't recognise the accusations against Reeves and \"would have been aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" as she would have been involved in the disciplinary process.",
      "She said there was \"extensive oversight of all expenses policies\" and claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\". But this is at odds with a document seen by BBC News and the testimony of 11 sources we have spoken to.",
      "Many of Reeves' former HBOS colleagues were worried about the consequences of sharing confidential information with BBC News but believe it is in the public interest for what happened, and their concerns about the now-Chancellor's spending of the bank's money, to be reported.",
      "But, given their concerns about speaking out publicly, we have agreed not to name them.",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir Starmer still thought the Chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",
      "The Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.",
      "She posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"",
      "The investigation at HBOS was not the last time Reeves would face scrutiny over her expenses.",
      "In 2015, it emerged that she was among 19 MPs who had had their official credit cards suspended by the parliamentary expenses watchdog after failing to show their spending was valid.",
      "Reeves owed more than \u00a34,000 in spending at the time when her card was blocked. She subsequently cleared her debt.",

      "Her parents separated when she was at primary school, and she and younger sister Ellie, also a Labour MP, were shuttled between separate homes.",
      "During the school holidays, the sisters would spend time with their grandparents in the Northamptonshire town of Kettering.",
      "They would be taken to do the rounds of relatives' houses, who would give them a 20p or 50p piece each. At the end of their week, they were taken to the local toy shop to choose their goodies. While Ellie would spend all her cash, the young Rachel would allow herself a smaller treat and save most of the money.",
      "Decades later, Chancellor Reeves would say that kind of restraint defines her, and she has very much modelled herself on Gordon Brown\u2019s \"prudence\" in the lead-up to Labour\u2019s 1997 election win.",
      "Chess talent",
      "Reeves played chess from an early age, with her father teaching her the key moves. She became a national under-14 champion, and would \"quietly thrash\" any boys who might think they were in for an easy game, according to Ellie.",
      "She has credited chess with teaching her \"to think ahead, to plan a strategy\".",

      "Seeing the extent of cuts at her school, where the library had been turned into a classroom and the sixth form consisted of \"two pre-fab huts in the playground\", she has said she was politicised by her own experience of public services. At the age of 16, she joined the Labour Party.",
      "She went on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University. As a student, she would host others before college discos, blasting out Destiny's Child songs and dressing up in her room.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 11:23:07 GMT",
    "summary": "They say the US should re-evaluate its cyber-security partnership with the UK unless the \"dangerous\" request is withdrawn.",
    "story": [
      "Two US lawmakers have strongly condemned what they call the UK's \"dangerous\"  and \"shortsighted\" request to be able to access encrypted data stored by Apple users worldwide in its cloud service.",
      "Senator Ron Wyden and Congressman Andy Biggs have written to national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard saying the demand threatens the privacy and security of the US.",
      "They urge her to give the UK an ultimatum: \"Back down from this dangerous attack on US cybersecurity, or face serious consequences.\"",
      "The BBC has contacted the UK government for comment.",
      "\"While the UK has been a trusted ally, the US government must not permit what is effectively a foreign cyberattack waged through political means\", the US politicians wrote.",
      "If the UK does not back down Ms Gabbard should \"reevaluate US-UK cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as US intelligence sharing\", they suggest.",
      "What is the UK seeking?",
      "The request for the data emerged last week.",
      "It applies to all content stored using what Apple calls \"Advanced Data Protection\" (ADP).",
      "This uses end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored. Apple itself cannot see it.",
      "It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it.",
      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",
      "The Home Office said then: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\"",
      "Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\".",
      "The order has been served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act, which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "Under the law, the demand by the Home Office cannot be made public.",
      "Senator Wyden and Congressman Biggs say agreeing to the request would \"undermine Americans' privacy rights and expose them to espionage by China, Russia and other adversaries\".",
      "They state that Apple does not make different versions of its encryption software for each country it operates in and, therefore, Apple customers in the UK will use the same software as Americans.",
      "\"If Apple is forced to build a backdoor in its products, that backdoor will end up in Americans' phones, tablets, and computers, undermining the security of Americans' data, as well as of the countless federal, state and local government agencies that entrust sensitive data to Apple products.\"",
      "The move by the UK government has stunned experts and worried privacy campaigners, with Privacy International calling it  an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals.",
      "However the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption as part of criminal investigations.",
      "In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.",
      "That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the passcode of an alleged drug dealer.",
      "Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base. The FBI later said it had been able to \"gain access\" to the phones.",
      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",
      "Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products.",
      "WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has also previously said it would choose being blocked over weakening message security.",
      "But even withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based there."

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:05:28 GMT",
    "summary": "It comes after more than 100 sites put themselves forward for consideration by a government taskforce.",
    "story": [
      "Work on a number of new towns will begin before the next general election after more than 100 locations across England were put forward, Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook has pledged.",
      "The government says most proposals are to extend existing towns or cities, alongside a \"smaller number\" of new standalone settlements.",
      "The aim is for each new town to have at least 10,000 homes, contributing towards Labour's 1.5 million five-year housebuilding target.",
      "Each should include infrastructure like public transport and schools, alongside affordable housing, ministers say.",
      "A visit to Milton Keynes by the PM to promote the policy was cut short earlier when farmers driving tractors staged a noisy protest.",
      "Ministers desperately want more housing - but are their plans radical enough?",
      "What's the new government's housebuilding target?",
      "Labour to select new town sites by end of first year",
      "The tractors' musical horns could be heard blaring across the building site shortly after Sir Keir Starmer arrived.",
      "It is the latest in a series of protests mounted by farmers against changes to inheritance tax on farms announced at October's Budget.",
      "Creating a new generation of new towns is a key element of the government's long-term plan for housebuilding, and part of its efforts to unlock economic growth.",
      "More than 100 potential sites across England have been suggested to a special taskforce set up to examine the options, after the government asked for expressions of interest from councils, housing developers and landowners.",
      "The sites have not been revealed, but London, the South East, the South West and the east of England have proved the most popular \u2013 though there were expressions of interest from every region.",
      "The taskforce will identify specific locations - as well as funding options - by the summer, with a view to construction on the first sites beginning by the time of the next election.",
      "Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the aim was to build \"well-designed, affordable, attractive homes\" that would \"eventually house millions of people, just as the post-War waves of new towns did\".",
      "He described it as a \"transformational programme\" that he expected to \"make a contribution to housing numbers in this parliament\".",
      "However, speaking on Sky News, he conceded: \"These things take time to get off the ground. No one's pretending that the new towns programme is going to make up the bulk of that 1.5 million number.",
      "\"We're relying on the other changes we've made, including overhauling the national planning policy framework to get new sites coming through.\"",
      "He said he expected some of the construction to take place on greenfield - or undeveloped - land, but there would also be \"big expansions of existing towns and cities where that is appropriate\".",
      "\"There's got to be sustainable places, as I say, they've got to be well-connected, well-designed.\"",
      "The plan envisages an initial injection of government funding to buy land, which would be returned when sites were sold for a higher price to private developers, and would help pay for local infrastructure.",
      "Sir Keir said the construction of new towns would form part of \"the largest housebuilding programme since the post-war era\", and help offer \"working people...  the security and stability that owning your own home bring\".",
      "The Conservatives seized on the new towns announcement to attack the government on immigration.",
      "Shadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake said: \"Labour's housebuilding plans will do nothing to address the shortage of housing because immigration will just keep piling on the pressure.\"",
      "Spending review",
      "When the policy was originally unveiled at the party's conference in 2023, Labour set out a plan to use state-backed companies to construct a wave of new towns near English cities, echoing those built by Labour after World War Two.",
      "However, it is not clear how much public money will be allocated to the initiative.",
      "Pennycook told Today this would be decided in the government's spending review which will conclude in June and set spending plans for the next three years.",
      "The review, which is being conducted in a period of minimal economic growth against the backdrop of Labour's self-imposed fiscal constraints, will see ministers haggle for money for their departments.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told departments to identify 5% \"efficiency savings\" as part of the process, to ensure key services are prioritised for funding.",
      "Polly Neate, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Shelter, urged the government to provide \"serious investment\" in affordable social housing \"to drive up building to the scale the country desperately needs\".",
      "\"New towns are a huge opportunity for the government to tackle housing need and provide local communities with homes they can actually afford to live in. The government must commit serious investment at the Spending Review in June to drive up building to the scale the country desperately needs.\"",
      "Clement Attlee's 1945-51 government planned the first wave of new towns to relocate people from poor or bombed-out housing, with development corporations assigned responsibility for building them.",
      "Stevenage in Hertfordshire was the first such town created, with 10 others following by 1955, including Crawley in Sussex, Harlow in Essex, and Newton Aycliffe in County Durham.",
      "Most were intended to accommodate the overspill of people from London.",
      "Since the 1950s, Parliament has approved further developments in England, Scotland and Wales."

    "summary": "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, official figures suggest.",
    "story": [
      "The UK economy unexpectedly grew in the final three months of last year following a boost to the construction and services sectors.",
      "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, according to official figures, despite analysts predicting it would contract.",
      "Growth in the quarter was driven by a range of industries, from pubs and bars to machinery manufacturers, having a strong December.",
      "However, the figures also indicated living standards last year were slightly lower than in 2023 on average.",
      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for sometime.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "The Bank of England has also halved its growth forecast for the UK this year, amid concerns that higher costs for employers could hit hiring, profits, investment - and push up prices. Last week, it decided to cut interest rates to 4.5%.",
      "Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the economy was \"all-but stagnating\" as businesses adjusted for higher costs and \"more uncertainty overseas\" - pointing to the introduction of trade tariffs in the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "He said it was a clear that \"a lot of the weakness\" in the economy was due to the rise in taxes on firms announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her Budget last year, with \"business sentiment on the floor\" and investment and consumer spending down.",
      "\"Overall, the economy is unlikely to do more than move sideways over the next six months,\" he suggested.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "But the latest figures showing a return to growth at the end of 2024 will be welcome news for the government, which has made growing the economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "A separate figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) measuring living standards fell 0.1% in 2024 compared with the year before. The measure - known as real GDP per head - calculates the volume of goods and services available to the average person in the UK and a person is deemed better off the more they have.",
      "When an economy grows, businesses on average have more money to spend to employ more people or give pay rises. Firms making more profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "All this together, in theory, leaves people better off - but it takes time for the benefits to be felt, and it does not necessarily benefit everyone.",
      "In December alone, the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.4%.",
      "Film distribution firms, pubs and bars all had a \"strong month\", as did industries involved in machinery manufacturing, according to Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS.",
      "However, this was offset by weak months in trade for computer programming, publishing and car sales businesses.",
      "In the construction sector, the final months of 2024 saw an increase in new work driven by new private housing projects, but repairs and maintenance work from private homes fell over the period, suggesting homeowners cut back.",
      "'People don't have the money'",
      "Sushma Solanki, the owner of Bolton catering firm Sushma's Snacks, told the BBC the economic situation was \"very worrying\" as she found trading at the end of last year very tough.",
      "\"I normally do about 20 to 30 Christmas office events,\" she said. \"Instead, I did two, which was very hard. People don't have the money.\"",
      "She said she had to let go an employee partly because of the upcoming rise in National Insurance.",
      "\"It's not just the policies, it's everything. Peppers for my chicken dish started off at 79p, they are \u00a31.85,\" she added.",
      "Chris Taylor, the owner of coffee shop Gran T's in Manchester, said he was \"shocked\" that there had been any growth in the economy.",
      "\"Going into last winter was one of the biggest struggles. I think a lot of people were naturally clinging onto their purse strings. Trade was not there,\" he said.",
      "\"This government's action plan, without hitting people directly with higher taxes, is hitting the level above and that effectively is going to hit people one way or another. It is really an indirect punch to the whole economy.\"",
      "Following the release of the new figures, the chancellor said she was still not satisfied with the performance of the economy.",
      "\"It's not possible to turn around more than a decade of poor economic performance in just a few months, but we are doing what is necessary to bring stability to the economy,\" she said.",
      "Reeves also said the government was going \"further and faster\" to \"put more money in people's pockets\".",
      "She also reiterated her self-imposed rules on borrowing and debt were \"non-negotiable\" after reports this week suggested the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, had downgraded growth forecasts.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Reeves's Budget was \"killing growth\" in the UK.",
      "\"Working people and businesses are already paying for her choices with ever rocketing taxes, hundreds of thousands of job cuts and business confidence plummeting,\" he added.",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said the chancellor's Budget was to blame for \"pitiful economic growth\".",
      "\"Her complete pig's ear of a jobs tax will hammer small businesses, the backbone of our economy.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 10:53:57 GMT",
    "summary": "It comes after concerns over the High Court's capacity to hear each individual case in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "The assisted dying bill would be strengthened by plans for cases to be signed off by experts rather than a judge, the MP behind the law change has said.",
      "The proposed law for England and Wales currently says a High Court judge must check each person is eligible and has not been coerced into making the decision to die.",
      "But Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP proposing the bill, will suggest replacing this with a panel of experts who would oversee applications.",
      "It comes after concerns were raised over the court's capacity to hear each individual case.",
      "Leadbeater told the BBC adding \"extra expertise\" would improve the bill.",
      "But some opponents have criticised the move as watering down the bill's safeguards.",
      "Conservative MP Danny Kruger - a leading critic of the bill - said while he welcomed the idea of more experts being involved in the process, he questioned whether they would be impartial like a judge.",
      "He said concerns about the court's capacity to hear individual cases was \"a problem for the bill\", which should not be proceeding \"without adequate judicial safeguards\".",
      "Leadbeater said the panel of experts \"would be professional people doing a professional job\".",
      "She said some would say the bill now had \"too many safeguards\".",
      "\"I've had emails saying why are you making this so difficult? Because we must remember at the heart of this is a terminally ill person who wants choice,\" she added.",
      "If approved, the bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, would allow terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life.",
      "The new proposal will be voted on by a committee of MPs scrutinising the bill. The members were chosen by Leadbeater and the majority support the legislation.",
      "It comes as the committee begins the process of going through the bill line by line.",
      "Labour MP Paul Foster, who voted for the bill at second reading, called the change a \"game changer\" and said he was reconsidering his support.",
      "Foster told the BBC he will now wait until he sees the full bill before deciding whether to vote against it after committee stage.",
      "Doctors must raise other options to assisted dying, MP says",
      "What is assisted dying and how could the law change?",
      "How assisted dying has spread across the world and how laws differ",
      "Under Leadbeater's proposal, the panel reviewing each application would be chaired by a senior legal figure, but not necessarily a judge, and would also include experts such as psychiatrists and social workers. Their decision could, if necessary, be reviewed by the High Court.",
      "The panels would be chosen by a Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission, led by a High Court judge or senior former judge.",
      "The commission would oversee all cases for an assisted death and report annually on the number of applications and how many were approved and rejected.",
      "Ministers and officials have been closely consulted on the change, although the government technically remains neutral on the bill. Civil servants are drafting the amendment, which will be published later this week.",
      "Leadbeater argued this was not removing judicial scrutiny but changing it to a \"judge plus\" model.",
      "However, she previously hailed the role of the High Court as part of \"three layers of scrutiny\" that made it \"the strongest, most robust piece of legislation on this issue in the world\".",
      "The committee of MPs scrutinising the bill heard three days of oral evidence from experts two weeks' ago, including some who raised concerns about the proposed role of the High Court in signing off applications.",
      "Retired High Court judge Sir Nicholas Mostyn told the panel he thought it would be \"impossible\" for the High Court to rule in every assisted dying case.",
      "\"You're talking about nearly three quarters of the entire Family Division [Court] doing nothing but this,\" he said.",
      "He added it should be done \"by a panel set up... for each case, a doctor and a lawyer, they have to agree, and they check everything has been done lawfully\".",
      "Leadbeater said she agreed with the need for other professionals to be involved in the checks.",
      "\"This bill already contains the strongest safeguards anywhere in the world, but I promised to give close attention to the advice we have received on how the bill could be made even stronger, and that is what I have done,\" she said.",
      "However, Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney, who sits on the committee and oppose the bill, said the version of the legislation initially passed by the House of Commons in November \"specifically gave provision for a High Court judge\" to sign off cases \"and many MPs voted for it on that basis\".",
      "\"So to make this really profound change at this time makes it very, very difficult for the committee to decide whether this is the right thing or not in order to improve the bill,\" she told BBC Breakfast.",
      "More than 300 amendments have been tabled, with more expected in the coming weeks.",
      "Among those to be debated on Tuesday is one tabled by Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon to allow those with a neurodegenerative illness, such as Parkinson's, to access an assisted death with 12 months to live. The bill currently restricts assisted dying to those with a terminal illness with six months or less to live.",
      "Gordon told BBC News: \"This bill is about ensuring people facing painful deaths from terminal conditions can have the choice of how they die.",
      "\"For those with neurodegenerative conditions, in their last six months, it may be too late for them to engage in the process of applying.\"",
      "It is understood Leadbeater does not support expanding the scope of the bill to include those with 12 months to live.",
      "MPs backed proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales in November, by a majority of 55.",
      "However, it will be debated further by the House of Commons and Lords later in the year, and the final version requires the approval of both before it becomes law.",

    "summary": "Trade Minister Douglas Alexander said the UK would not have \"a knee-jerk reaction\" but \"a clear-headed\" response.",
    "story": [
      "The UK will not retaliate immediately to the renewal of steel and aluminium tariffs by the US, the government has said.",
      "Trade minister Douglas Alexander said the UK would not have \"a knee-jerk reaction\" but \"a cool and clear-headed\" response.",
      "Many in the industry are calling on Britain to join the EU and Canada who have said they will hit back against the policy announced by US President Donald Trump on Monday.",
      "The tariffs, set to apply from 12 March, would mean any steel or aluminium coming into the US would be subject to an import tax worth 25% of its value.",
      "The US is the world's largest importer of steel, counting Canada, Brazil and Mexico as its top three suppliers, and Trump sees imposing tariffs, which will be paid by companies bringing the metal into the US, as a way of shifting away from foreign imports and boosting domestic steel production.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. However, for some suppliers of specialist products, trade with the US is much more important.",
      "Gareth Stace, director general of the industry body UK Steel, said Trump had taken a \"sledgehammer to free trade with huge ramifications for the steel sector in the UK and across the world\" as he called for \"stronger action\" from the government.",
      "\"Our high-quality products serve key US industries, many of which cannot source these domestically. This is a moment where our countries should work together to tackle global steel overproduction, not to be at loggerheads,\" he added.",
      "There are also concerns within the industry that the tariffs might not only hinder exports to the US, but could also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",
      "This is because if other countries are no longer exporting to the US, they may look to offload their steel at a cheaper price, potentially leading to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.",
      "Unite, the union representing UK steel workers, said Trump's announcement \"should be a wake-up call for this government\" as it called on it to buy more British steel in response.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "With Trump's tariffs looming - will countries scramble to cut deals?",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "UK ministers planned to meet the steel industry and unions on Tuesday and visit key steel companies later this week.",
      "Speaking in Parliament, Alexander said the US deadline on tariffs coming into force would give the government time to engage with steel firms and unions in the UK, and also with US trade officials.",
      "But shadow trade minister Harriett Baldwin said it was \"a moment of great peril for the UK steel industry because the UK has failed to engage with gusto with the new US administration\".",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey urged the government to show \"urgency\" in dealing with the issue and protecting jobs.",
      "The UK's direction of travel on tariffs in general appears to be a clear attempt to differentiate it from other G7 allies' attempts to project strength to the White House.",
      "Canada's industry minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne has called the decision to impose tariffs \"totally unjustified\" and said its response would be \"clear and calibrated\".",
      "Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered\".",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesperson declined to say whether Trump was wrong to impose the tariffs.",
      "\"We will take a considered approach to this. We will engage with the US on the detail, but the government is clear we will work in our national interest and this issue is no different to that,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Trump has announced and threatened a host of import taxes since taking office, particularly aimed at countries and trading blocs, such as the EU, which export more to the US than they import.",
      "Tariffs are paid by companies buying from overseas, not to the overseas companies selling to them.",
      "The importing company may choose to pass the cost on to customers directly or to absorb the cost themselves, or simply to reduce imports. Foreign exporters could also decide to cut their prices to protect sales.",
      "Trump introduced similar steel and aluminium tariffs in 2018 during his first term, but many countries, including the UK, were later able to work out exemptions.",
      "The US president has said he will not consider any exceptions this time round, although it seems like he may set this rule aside for Australia.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had spoken on the phone with Trump and that the US leader was considering an exemption.",
      "Trump has also delayed previously announced tariffs on Canada and Mexico, prompting questions of whether the policies will all go ahead."

      "\"If the UK government does not take action to stop what is happening there will continue to be more victims of modern slavery.\"",

      "A discovery underneath the basement of an office block has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history unearthed in the city of London.",

      "The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.",
      "The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.",
      "\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",
      "On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.",
      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",
      "The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.",
      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",
      "The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.",
      "\"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson.",
      "\"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\"",
      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",
      "The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.",
      "For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges.",
      "\"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot.",
      "\"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\"",
      "And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building.",
      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",
      "This is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public.",
      "Parts of an amphitheatre are on display under a glass floor at the Guildhall Art Gallery, and at Bloomberg's offices, people can visit the Temple of Mithras, which has been brought to life with an immersive sound and light installation.",
      "Chris Hayward from the City of London Corporation says he wants more people to experience the link between the past and the present.",
      "\"The fact that Roman London is beneath your feet is, frankly, quite a remarkable emotion to experience,\" he said.",
      "\"You can actually see and visualise how Roman London would have been in those times. And then you can walk outside and you can say, 'now look at the skyscrapers, now look at the office blocks', this is progress, but at the same time, progress combined with preservation.\""

      "But the BBC has discovered evidence that they were warned repeatedly over several years that the scheme, set up by the government and funded by various oil firms to the tune of $1bn (\u00a3805m), has been suffering from a string of issues.",
      "One close observer has described the clean-up project as a \"con\" and a \"scam\" that has wasted money and left the people of Ogonliland, which lies in the Niger Delta, continuing to live with the devastating impact of oil pollution - 13 years after a ground-breaking UN report lifted the lid on the seriousness of their situation.",
      "Shell's Nigerian subsidiary told the BBC: \"The operating environment in the Niger Delta remains challenging because of the huge scale of illegal activities such as oil theft.",
      "\"When spills do happen from our facilities we clean up and remediate, regardless of the cause. If it's an operational spill, we also compensate people and communities.\"",
      "The allegations come as a civil trial is expected to begin on Thursday at the High Court in London, where lawyers representing two Ogoniland communities of around 50,000 inhabitants will say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution that occurred between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from its infrastructure.",

      "It also found that sites that Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), claimed to have remediated, were still polluted and the techniques they used did not reach regulatory requirements.",

      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",

      "The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.",
      "\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",
      "On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.",
      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",
      "The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.",
      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",

      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",
      "The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.",

      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",
      "This is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public.",
      "Parts of an amphitheatre are on display under a glass floor at the Guildhall Art Gallery, and at Bloomberg's offices, people can visit the Temple of Mithras, which has been brought to life with an immersive sound and light installation.",

      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",

      "In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.",
      "That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the passcode of an alleged drug dealer.",
      "Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base. The FBI later said it had been able to \"gain access\" to the phones.",
      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",

      "The lawsuit claims the children died trying the \"blackout challenge\", in which a person intentionally deprives themselves of oxygen.",
      "Giles Derrington, senior government relations manager at TikTok, told BBC Radio 5 Live there were some things \"we simply don't have\" because of \"legal requirements around when we remove data\".",
      "Speaking on Safer Internet Day, a global initiative to raise awareness about online harms, Mr Derrington said TikTok had been in contact with some of the parents, adding that they \"have been through something unfathomably tragic\".",

      "Ellen Roome, mother of 14-year-old Jools, said she had been trying to obtain data from TikTok that she thinks could provide clarity on his death. She is campaigning for legislation to grant parents access to their child's social media accounts if they die.",
      "\"We want TikTok to be forthcoming, to help us - why hold back on giving us the data?\" Lisa Kenevan, mother of 13-year-old Isaac, told the programme. \"How can they sleep at night?\"",

      "It claims their children died participating in a trend that circulated widely on TikTok in 2022, despite the site having rules around not showing or promoting dangerous content that could cause significant physical harm.",
      "While Mr Derrington would not comment on the specifics of the ongoing case, he said of the parents: \"I have young kids myself and I can only imagine how much they want to get answers and want to understand what's happened.",
      "\"We've had conversations with some of those parents already to try and help them in that.\"",
      "He said the so-called \"blackout challenge\" predated TikTok, adding: \"We have never found any evidence that the blackout challenge has been trending on the platform.",

      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

      "The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message.",
      "\"It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,\" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia.",
      "The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.",
      "\"I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,\" he says.",
      "Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media.",
      "Their approaches differ but a common tactic is to secretly film someone being given money, or tickets to a gig or sports match, or perhaps a free haircut.",
      "\"Kindness is cool,\" says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers.",
      "Mr Dereniowski's videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money.",
      "\"I suppose I want to really emphasise that every single person you come across has a story\u2026 and often the people who have the least give the most,\" says Mr Dereniowski, who lives in Windsor, near Toronto in Canada, and started the account after giving free hugs to strangers.",
      "Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.",
      "The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular?",
      "Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments.",
      "\"Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content.\"",
      "On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism?",
      "\"\"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,\" says Ms Cleary.",
      "Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out.",
      "\"I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,\" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.",
      "She explains that the videos often involve someone being identified as \"in need\". They are then asked for a favour. It might be spare money for a bus fare or help with something.",
      "She argues the participant is being \"lured\" into valuing the needs of someone else, who appears richer, more highly than their own.",
      "Only if they do that are they rewarded.",
      "\"I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,\" asks Ms Burke.",
      "The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy.",
      "\"I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "And how about filming people without their consent?",
      "\"If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "But he adds that these days he avoids filming people without consent as it was making him \"feel weird\".",
      "Sometimes large amounts of money are given to vulnerable people, which they might not be in a position to manage.",

      "While I was providing live coverage for BBC Scotland a large car with tinted windows drove past me slowly, inside four stony-faced officers from the Toulouse homicide and organised crime branch.",
      "There is no question locals are scared. Several officers from the Gendarmerie photographed our car and asked to see our ID cards and urged us to be discreet. They said the residents were frightened and that their presence was partly to reassure them.",
      "There is bright yellow Gendarmerie tape strapped to the front gate of the Searle's home. The dogs are gone and their swimming pool has a cover over it. Two large candles have been lit in the driveway and a leaflet taped to the gate has a phone number for anyone who feels they need psychological counselling or moral support, provided by local social services. The same leaflet has been taped to a community board in the centre of the hamlet.",
      "The Searle couple retired to this region five years ago, and other mailboxes in the hamlet indicate they are not the only expatriates in the region. This isn't surprising: there are no official statistics but in the time I have been based in Toulouse, Foreign Office staff have told me at various times they believe around 30,000 Brits live full-time in the south west, making it the biggest British expat population in France outside of Paris.",
      "On top of that tens of thousands more have holiday homes in this region, called Occitanie, which is one of the fastest growing areas of France, attracting people from not just the UK but Belgium, the Netherlands and Paris.",
      "What attracts them here is the quality of life, wide open spaces, relatively cheap property and achingly beautiful countryside and architecture.",
      "The nearby town of Villefranche-de-Rouergue has one of the most beautiful medieval stone arcade-lined central squares in a region teeming with them. In summer, an open-air market in the square is crammed with holiday makers, including many Brits, carrying weaved baskets filled with local produce.",
      "Various conspiracy theories circulate about how the couple died \u2013 I've been asked about them by countless French national TV and radio media outlets. But all we know for sure is that the prosecutor and his team are still trying to determine, as he reiterated to me on Wednesday night, \"whether the tragedy resulted from a domestic crime followed by suicide or involved a third party\".",
      "Ever since the deaths I've been speaking to the prosecutor leading the case, who revealed to me late this week that he was handing over the investigation to a senior judge in Montpellier with more resources available.",
      "I asked him if that means he was leaning towards the idea that the Searle couple were both murdered.",
      "He replied that he was not ruling anything out. He added that if they were murdered, and it goes to trial, he would lead the prosecution.",
      "Dr Remy Sevigne, the psychologist who answers the counselling hotline from the leaflets, told me that so far around a dozen people had called him for some sort of support. They were all local, he said, and all knew the couple personally.",

      "But there is a simple reason he was able to escape the whale so quickly, according to a wildlife expert.",
      "Humpback whales have narrow throats \"about the size of a household pipe\" designed for swallowing small fish and shrimp, Brazilian conservationist Roched Jacobson Seba told the BBC.",
      "\"They physically cannot swallow large objects like kayaks, tires, or even big fish like tuna,\" he said.",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 01:00:34 GMT",
    "summary": "The controversial ruling once again shines a spotlight on the issue of marital rape in India, which refuses to criminalise it.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This report contains some disturbing details",
      "An Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women.",
      "The controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.",
      "Earlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.",
      "The lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently.",
      "But on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act.",
      "The judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India.",
      "\"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.",
      "\"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"",
      "Priyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\".",
      "She added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger.",
      "\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"",
      "The court documents make for grim reading.",
      "According to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will\u2026 causing her a lot of pain\".",
      "After he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later.",
      "In her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\".",
      "A dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.",
      "While convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.",
      "Justice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.",
      "The lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\".",
      "\"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\"",
      "Considering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly.",
      "India is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence.",
      "A number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860.",
      "The British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years.",

      "India government says criminalising marital rape 'excessively harsh'",
      "In India, growing clamour to criminalise rape within marriage",
      "The idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it.",
      "But in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape.",
      "The Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move.",
      "In October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\".",
      "Authorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency.",
      "\"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said.",
      "\"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks.",
      "Violence within marriage is rampant in India.",
      "According to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% have experienced sexual violence by their husbands.",
      "And even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame.",
      "\"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Ms Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes.",
      "\"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\"",
      "She added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\".",
      "\"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?\""

      "Mr Titarchuk told Ukraine's state news agency that \"the situation is under control\".",

      "The radiation shield is designed to prevent further radioactive material leaking out over the next century. It measures 275m (900ft) wide and 108m (354ft) tall and cost $1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) to construct.",

      "The shield \"was never built to withstand external drone attack\", he told the BBC, but a \"complex piece of decommissioning kit\" built to contain the radioactive materials inside and to help safely deconstruct the broken reactor.",
      "The strike appeared to hit the maintenance system of a crane designed to remotely take the reactor apart, he said.",
      "There appears to be \"pretty serious\" damage to the outer and inner cladding, he added, but said a fuller assessment of the damage will be needed before the bank can determine its costs.",
      "Mr Evans said the mission to build the shelter was the \"world's largest ever collaboration on nuclear safety\", with more than 40 counties working together on it.",
      "\"Ever since the start of the war, it's been tragic to see that international co-operation undermined by reckless acts,\" he added.",

      "Even after 5,000 years in a sarcophagus, mummified bodies from ancient Egypt still smell quite nice, scientists have discovered.",

      "As a result, pharaohs and members of the nobility were adorned with oils, waxes and balms during the mummification process.",
      "\"In films and books, terrible things happen to those who smell mummified bodies,\" said Dr Bembibre said.",
      "\"We were surprised at the pleasantness of them.\"",
      "The authors of the academic study, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society on Thursday, had to get the smell from inside the sarcophagus without interfering with the mummy inside.",
      "The researchers, from UCL and the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, did so by inserting a tiny tube so they were able measure the scent without taking any physical samples.",
      "Dr Bembibre explained that heritage scientists are always trying to find \"non-destructive\" ways to discover new information.",

      "\"We believe that this approach is potentially of huge interest to other types of museum collections,\" he said.",
      "As well as providing museum-goers with a new sensory insight into mummies, the discovery also presents a potential breakthrough for mummy conservationists.",
      "The researchers used a technique called gas chromatography to separate the different smells inside the sarcophagus that combined to make its scent.",
      "They found odours relating to the break-down of animal fats used in the embalming process, which could indicate the body is beginning to decompose.",
      "Because of these findings, it will be possible to \"practically intervene\" in the conservation of the mummies, identifying how best to store and wrap the bodies, the research paper said.",

      "Infant mortality rates have increased in US states which have enacted abortion bans, a study has found.",
      "Researchers estimate there were 478 infant deaths across 14 states which have outright bans or heavy restrictions - which they say would not have occurred had the laws not been in place.",
      "The rise comes after the US Supreme Court reversed a ruling in 2022 that made abortion up to foetal viability a national right, allowing individual states to decide on whether to allow the procedure.",
      "Alison Gemmill, co-leader of the study, said \"restrictive abortion policies\" could be \"reversing decades of progress\" in reducing infant deaths across the US.",
      "The study, published this week by researchers from the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, found an increase in mortality rates for babies born with congenital issues, as well as among groups where death rates already were higher than average.",
      "This included black infants, as well as for babies whose parents were unmarried, younger, did not attend college, and for those living in southern states.",
      "As of January 2025, 17 states have outlawed nearly all abortions, though some have narrow exceptions for cases of rape, incest or the health of the mother.",

      "Florida, Georgia, Iowa and South Carolina ban the procedure beyond six weeks of pregnancy.",

      "Congenital malformations",

      "In the UK, the infant mortality rate is estimated at around 3.8 per 1,000 live births. Slovenia, Singapore and Iceland have among the world's lowest infant mortality rates, at between 1.5-1.6 deaths per 1,000 live births.",
      "Afghanistan currently has the world's highest rate, with an estimated 101.3 deaths every 1,000 live births.",
      "The study also found an increase in the number of infant deaths in the US from congenital anomalies, rising from an expected 1.24 per 1,000 live births to 1.37 per 1,000 - a relative increase of 10.87%.",
      "Mortality from other causes rose to 4.89 per 1,000 from an expected 4.69, a 4.23% increase.",

      "According to the research, the increase in infant mortality due to congenital malformations was consistent with women being denied abortions for non-viable pregnancies - where a pregnancy cannot possibly result in a liveborn baby.",
      "But the increase due to non-congenital causes \"is less straightforward\", researchers say.",
      "The study also found the ban may be disproportionately impacting disadvantaged populations who are already at a higher risk of infant mortality as well as delays in receiving medical care.",

    "story": [
      "Hamas has said it is committed to implementing the Gaza ceasefire deal with Israel and will continue releasing hostages as scheduled, raising hopes that a resumption of the war can be averted.",
      "Following talks in Cairo, the Palestinian armed group said mediators from Egypt and Qatar had confirmed they would \"remove obstacles\". Egyptian and Qatari reports also said gaps had been bridged.",
      "An Israeli government spokesman did not comment on the reports but stated that if Hamas did not free three living hostages on Saturday then the ceasefire would end.",
      "Israel's prime minister made a similar ultimatum on Tuesday after Hamas said it was postponing releases over what it claimed were Israeli violations.",
      "Hamas said these included a failure to allow in the agreed amounts of vital humanitarian aid, including tents and shelters, which Israel denied.",
      "The group's threat to derail the deal prompted US President Donald Trump to propose Israel cancel the agreement altogether and \"let hell break out\" unless \"all of the hostages\" were returned by Saturday.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he welcomed Trump's demand and warned: \"If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon [10:00 GMT], the ceasefire will end and the [Israeli military] will resume intense fighting until the final defeat of Hamas.\"",
      "However, there were conflicting messages from Israeli officials about whether he was demanding the release of all 76 hostages still in Gaza - in line with Trump's ultimatum - or just the three due to be freed this weekend.",
      "Confusion clouds efforts to save Gaza ceasefire",
      "'We are tired of war': Israelis and Gazans fear ceasefire collapse",
      "What we know about the Gaza ceasefire deal",
      "On Wednesday, an Egyptian security source told the BBC that Egypt and Qatar were \"intensifying their diplomatic efforts in an attempt to salvage the ceasefire agreement\", as Hamas's leader for Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, arrived in Cairo to hold talks with Egypt's intelligence chief and other officials.",
      "After concluding the talks on Thursday morning, Hamas put out a statement saying they focused on the need for all terms of the deal to be fulfilled, particularly regarding deliveries of caravans, tents, heavy construction equipment, medical supplies and fuel.",
      "It added that the talks were \"positive\" and that the mediators had agreed to work to \"remove obstacles and close gaps\".",
      "\"Accordingly, Hamas reaffirms its commitment to implementing the agreement as signed, including the exchange of prisoners according to the specified timeline.\"",
      "At the same time, Egyptian state-run Al Qahera TV reported that Egypt and Qatar had successfully \"overcome obstacles\" and that Israel and Hamas were committed to fully implementing the ceasefire deal.",
      "Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV also said the negotiations had been successful and that mobile homes and heavy machinery would be allowed into Gaza on Thursday.",
      "However, Israeli media then cited the Israeli prime minister's office as calling the Al Jazeera report \"fake news\" and saying there was \"no basis\" to it.",
      "Omer Dostri, a spokesman for the prime minister, later clarified the denial, writing on X: \"There is no entry of caravans or heavy equipment into the Gaza Strip, and there is no co-ordination for this.\"",
      "When asked about Hamas's statement at a later media briefing, another Israeli government spokesman said Israel's position on the ceasefire agreement was \"crystal clear\".",
      "\"There is a framework in place for the release of our hostages,\" David Mencer said. \"That framework makes clear that three live hostages must be released by Hamas terrorists on Saturday.\"",
      "\"If those three are not released, if Hamas does not return our hostages, by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end.\"",
      "War-weary Palestinians in Gaza said they had been alarmed by the prospect of a return to fighting after 16 months of devastating war.",
      "\"When the truce was announced, we felt immense joy. However, with the announcement of a new crisis, fear returned [and] traders began raising commodity prices,\" Mouti al-Qedra told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme.",
      "\"I pray to God constantly for lasting peace, especially after the martyrdom of 65 members of the al-Qedra family. Now, we are relieved that the crisis has been resolved, hoping no more martyrs will fall.\"",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire deal is supposed to last six weeks and see a total of 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza.",
      "So far, 16 living Israeli hostages have been freed since the ceasefire took effect on 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages outside the terms of the deal.",
      "The 17 other Israeli hostages due to be released during the first phase are two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50. They are supposed to be handed over in the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of these hostages are dead, but only one has been named.",
      "Negotiations for the ceasefire's second phase - which should see the 43 remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire - have not yet begun.",
      "The deal has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their homes in the north, and hundreds of aid lorries allowed into the territory each day.",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.",
      "More than 48,230 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter."

      "Last October, the UK announced it would hand over sovereignty of the islands,  known officially as the British Indian Ocean Territory, to Mauritius but would maintain a 99-year lease over the UK-US military airbase on the largest island, Diego Garcia.",
      "The deal was reached with former Mauritian leader Pravind Jugnauth, but Navin Ramgoolam, his replacement, has been very critical.",

      "Elon Musk's children have been to places many will never see.",
      "From meetings with foreign leaders to the control room of a SpaceX launch, Musk's children have debuted as constant sidekicks to their father's endeavors in tech, business and now, politics.",
      "They have made frequent appearances in the nation's capital since President Donald Trump tapped the tech billionaire and Tesla co-founder to lead the newly-formed Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Musk's four-year-old, \"Lil X\", hung on the corner of the Resolute desk in the Oval Office on Wednesday sporting a tan pea coat and a collared shirt.",
      "On Thursday, X and two of his siblings exchanged gifts with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while their father discussed technology and innovation with the foreign leader.",
      "Musk has frequently been seen with his children even before coming to Washington - at a meeting with the president of Turkey, a memorial service at Auschwitz concentration camp, and a Time magazine ceremony where he was named the 2021 person of the year.",
      "But why do Musk's children tag along?",
      "\"The inclusion of the kids in many public appearances is very much a politician move or a political move to make him seem a bit more personable (and) take a human approach to how the public views him,\" says Kurt Braddock, an American University professor of public communication.",
      "Why bring the kids?",
      "Still, Mr Braddock thought the decision to bring Musk's preschooler to the Oval Office was unusual.",
      "X appeared bored during the 30-minute press briefing as he mimicked his father, sat on the floor and received the occasional side glance and smile from the leader of the free world. At one point, it appeared he told someone in the room to \"shush\" their mouth.",
      "Mr Braddock said he believes their inclusion is intentional - a distraction that benefits both Musk and Trump.",
      "\"I do think that there is a bit of a strategy here trying to draw attention to some things while diverting attention to other things,\" he said.",
      "Jon Haber, a strategic communication consultant who has worked with five presidential campaigns and teaches at Harvard, said Musk's children making frequent appearances - and creating viral moments - is beneficial for Trump.",

I mean, I think E is really seeing him as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and bringing him to everything and stuff.\u2026 X is out there. His situation is like that. But, yeah, I don't know.\"",
      "Musk and his children",
      "Long before politics, Musk allowed his children to tag along.",
      "A decade ago, when he was still building his profile and eager to draw attention to his electric-vehicle maker Tesla, it wasn't unusual to see them at events.",
      "As analysts and reporters waited for one unveiling to begin at a Tesla facility in Silicon Valley in 2015, his five children could be seen running through the hallways chasing after each other and shrieking with laughter.",
      "Despite being forced to wait for hours for attendees, the presence of Musk's children created an atmosphere that felt relaxed and even joyous.",
      "It was a departure from the stiff, far more formal events held by other companies for which the prospect of seeing an executive's very young children would have come across as odd.",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:49:09 GMT",
    "summary": "A BBC film follows children over nine months including one boy, 11, who volunteered at al-Aqsa hospital.",
    "story": [
      "Zakaria is 11 years old and lives in Gaza. He reckons he has seen thousands of bodies since the war started.",
      "But at an age when children are typically found in a classroom, Zakaria is volunteering at one of Gaza's few functioning hospitals - al-Aqsa.",
      "As a succession of ambulances ferrying victims of the war between Israel and Hamas pull up outside the facility in the central town of Deir al-Balah, Zakaria clears a way through the crowds to retrieve newly arrived patients and rush them inside for treatment.",
      "Moments later he is running through the corridors of the hospital with a stretcher and later carries a young child inside to the emergency room.",
      "Several of his schoolfriends have been killed since the conflict started and hanging around the hospital means Zakaria witnesses shocking scenes. He says that once, after an Israeli strike, he saw a boy in front of him burn to death in a fire.",
      "\"I must have seen at least 5,000 bodies. I saw them with my own eyes,\" he tells our cameraman.",
      "Zakaria is one of the children and young people we spent nine months following for our BBC documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.",
      "It's a film that my colleague Yousef Hammash and I co-directed from London, because international journalists have not been allowed by Israel to enter the Gaza Strip and report independently since the start of the war 16 months ago.",
      "To gather the footage and the interviews, we employed two cameramen who live in Gaza - Amjad Al Fayoumi and Ibrahim Abu Ishaiba - communicating with them regularly using messaging apps, internet calls and mobile phone networks.",
      "Yousef and I wanted to make this documentary to show what everyday life is like for Gazan people trying to survive the horrors of this conflict as it unfolded. We finished filming a few weeks ago, on the day the current ceasefire started.",
      "We focused on three children and a young woman with a newborn because they are the innocents in this war, which came to a shaky pause on 19 January when a hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel took effect.",
      "More than 48,200 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The military action followed the attacks on southern Israel by Hamas on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.",
      "By and large we filmed in an area of southern and central Gaza earmarked by Israel's army as a \"humanitarian zone\", where Palestinians were told to go for their own safety. Despite its designation, the zone itself was struck almost 100 times between May 2024 and January this year, according to analysis by BBC Verify. The Israel Defense Forces said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating there.",
      "We wanted to know how children found food, decided where to sleep and how they occupied themselves while trying to survive.",
      "Abdullah, 13, narrates the film. He speaks excellent English having attended the British school in Gaza before the war and does all he can to keep going with his education.",
      "Renad, 10, does a cooking show on TikTok with the help of her older sister. They make many kinds of dishes, even though the war means they can't get the proper ingredients, and have more than one million followers.",
      "We also followed Rana, 24, who has given birth to a baby girl prematurely. She has been displaced three times and lives near the hospital with her two sons and her parents.",
      "Some of the film also looks at how medics fought to keep people alive in al-Aqsa hospital, which was described in January 2024 by British doctors as the only functioning hospital in central Gaza.",
      "That's where we found Zakaria.",
      "Everyone working at the hospital knows the boy. He is, of course, still a child and not a qualified medic but he is always hanging around, waiting for an opportunity to help someone, in the hope he might receive some food or money in return.",
      "Sometimes he helps carry equipment for local journalists, other times stretchers with people injured or dying.",
      "When there is a quiet moment he helps clean the blood and dirt from the ambulances.",
      "There is no school for him to go to and he is the only person in his family making any money. He doesn't stay with them as they have little food or water, he says, and instead lives on his own at the hospital and sleeps where he can. One night it's in the CT scan room, another in the journalists' tent or the back of an ambulance.",
      "There were plenty of nights he fell asleep hungry.",
      "As much as they try, hospital staff can't keep him away from the chaos of caring for casualties.",
      "Zakaria idolises the paramedics and wants to be considered part of the team. One of them, Said, takes him under his wing. Whenever he treats Zakaria as a child, he says, the boy gets upset.",
      "Other staff see the care and attention Zakaria pays to them and the patients in the hospital and teach him to give someone an IV drip.",
      "In recognition of his efforts, they even make him a miniature set of blue scrubs \u2013 which he takes great pride in.",
      "Said tries to ensure the boy still gets a semblance of childhood and in the film we follow them on a trip to the beach.",
      "Sitting under the fronds of a tree branch, Zakaria tucks into the lunch Said has bought. The shawarma, he says, is perfect. Said jokes it's the only time the boy ever \"shuts up\".",
      "But Said worries Zakaria has seen so much death and destruction that he may never fit in with children his age again.",

      "Hollywood may be known as Tinseltown, a dream factory at the heart of the global entertainment industry. But nowadays crews are more likely to film in Atlanta, London, Toronto or Sydney than in Los Angeles.",
      "Cheaper labour and better tax breaks have lured producers away from the City of Angels for years. The wildfires, which killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes, have only added to this existential crisis.",
      "Now, many here are calling on the state - and studios and streaming services - to boost local production.",
      "\"The best thing the studios could do for fire relief is to bring work back for the rank and file LA film workers,\" says Mark Worthington, a production designer whose home burned down in Altadena.",
      "\"That's what we want.\"",
      "Mr Worthington had already been struggling to cope with the city's downturn, noting he hadn't set foot on an LA set in two years.

      "The loss clearly stings. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a band synonymous with Los Angeles, with many love songs to the City of Angels. But a biopic about the band is being filmed in Atlanta, Georgia - which has become a major production hub due to its lucrative tax breaks - not LA.",
      "Before the fires, \"Survive until '25\" had become a kind of mantra for Mr Worthington and other filmmakers who hoped for a turnaround of fortune. Instead, their city went up in flames.",
      "\"It's crushing in terms of how you see yourself as a creative individual and just as a person, and then on top of that to have these fires,\" Mr Worthington says. \"This is adding a horrible other thing to pile on top of all the other difficulties and our own work situation over the last couple years.\"",

      "But studios don't often make business decisions based on the greater good of workers in one city - ultimately, they care about the bottom line.

They also want studios to commit to making 10% more productions in Los Angeles.",
      "\"We need to bring production back to LA and get LA working again if we want to rebuild,\" says Ms Smith.",
      "Before the fires, California Gov Newsom had already proposed to more than double the tax credit the state offers to producers of films and TV shows that shoot in California \u2013 changing the annual credit from $330m to $750m, but that must be approved by the state legislature and might not come into effect until the summer.",

      "About a mile away, Jamie Morse's home also burned. Topanga Canyon has always attracted artists, musicians and dreamers - and Morse had just quit her sensible day job to devote 2025 to making it in Hollywood, working fulltime on her comedic writing and performing.",

      "Here's what we know about the attack so far.",
      "What happened?",
      "Munich police said the car, a Mini Cooper, accelerated and ploughed into the back of a rally by the Verdi trade union during a strike by public sector workers. It happened in Munich's city centre at the junction of Karlstrasse and Seidlstrasse at about 10:30 local time (11:30 GMT).",
      "Employees of day-care centres, hospitals, sanitation facilities and public swimming pools had joined the strike, calling for higher pay and longer holidays.",

      "One shot was fired at the vehicle by police before the driver was detained at the scene.",

      "It is unclear whether the suspect was injured.",
      "A police spokesman told local public broadcaster BR that police were checking whether there was a link between the demonstration and the incident.",
      "The crash happened hours before the US vice president and Ukrainian president were due to arrive in the city for the Munich Security Conference - but police say they don't believe it's related.",
      "How many were injured?",
      "At least 30 people were injured, including two seriously, German police said on Thursday.",
      "The local fire service said some of those hurt were in a \"life-threatening condition\".",

      "Some of the injured included employees of the Munich city administration, Munich's deputy mayor Dominik Krause said.",
      "Several participants at the trade union rally had brought their children with them, \"which makes the act even more heinous\", Krause said.",
      "Who is the suspect?",
      "The suspect, Farhad N, who we are not fully naming due to German privacy rules, is a 24-year-old asylum seeker from Afghanistan.",
      "He resides in Munich, German police said, adding that his motive was unclear.",
      "\"It was probably an attack,\" Bavaria state premier Markus S\u00f6der told reporters.",
      "Bavarian interior minister Joachim Herrmann said the suspect had his asylum application rejected, but he had not been forced to leave due to security concerns in Afghanistan.",
      "He later clarified that the suspect had a valid residence and work permit and that everything about him was legitimate.",
      "According to the the German Press Agency, the suspect came to Germany in 2016 as a minor.",
      "Herrmann said initially that the suspect had been known to police but later explained that he had previously worked as a store detective and had been a  witness in several cases of shoplifting.",
      "Bavarian state premier Markus S\u00f6der told German TV that counter-terrorism officials had taken over the inquiry but \"previous extremist backgrounds are not so easily recognisable at first glance\".",

      "What have witnesses said?",
      "The BBC's Daniel Wittenberg, reporting from Munich, said there was a pram strewn across the floor at the scene, as well as half a dozen umbrellas and high-vis jackets.",

      "\"It may change but at this stage we think that this is the most tragic day that she's talked about,\" Mr Levy says.",
      "Footage of Naama that day shows her and other female soldiers in bloodstained clothing surrounded by armed men in a room at the base before being forced into a vehicle and taken to Gaza.",
      "The three female soldiers whose parents spoke to the BBC are among five from an all-women unarmed military unit at Nahal Oz freed in the first round of the ceasefire.",
      "Members of the unit, known in Hebrew as Tatzpitaniyot, are tasked with observing the Gaza border and looking for signs of anything suspicious. Survivors and relatives of some of those killed that day say that they had been warning for months that Hamas had been preparing for an attack.",
      "A few days before the 7 October attack, Daniella had been at home on a break from service. She had told her mother then: \"Mummy, when I go back to the army, there's going to be a war.\"",
      "\"I didn't think it was going to be such a war and of course that my daughter would be taken hostage,\" Ms Gilboa says.",
      "Ms Gilboa and the families of the two other observers who spoke to the BBC say they are joining calls for an inquiry into what happened.",
      "They say their daughters remain concerned about the conditions of those still in Gaza and have called for the ceasefire to continue.",
      "Meanwhile, Ms Leshem Gonen says she is still learning what happened to her daughter Romi.",
      "She was shot at the Nova music festival and her mother says she was not properly treated, leaving her with \"an open wound where she could see the bone\".",
      "\"This is something we can know and that she speaks about. The other things, I think it will take time.\"",
      "Ms Leshem Gonen says Romi described her release in the first week of the truce as \"intimidating\" and \"frightening\". She was surrounded by gunmen and crowds. But the moment of their reunion was \"so powerful\".",
      "The parents also described how their daughters had found ways to get through each day in captivity - through drawing, making notes or sharing stories with each other.",
      "\"They wrote as much as they could, every day - what was happening, where were they moving, who were the guards and things like that,\" says Mr Berger.",
      "While in captivity, the young women had dreamt about the things they wanted to do when they got home: getting a haircut and eating sushi.",
      "Daniella had drawn a butterfly with the word \"freedom\" while in captivity - she now has that tattooed on her arm.",
      "They are adapting to life back in Israel, and their families say they are taking the recovery step by step.",
      "The moment of reunion with his daughter Naama is still a blur, says Mr Levy, but he remembers the emotion.",
      "\"The feeling was that... I will take care of you now, and everything's going to be OK. Daddy's here. That's all. And then everything was quiet.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 18:20:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Many world leaders, including Ukraine's President Zelensky, are finding the world is more uncertain under new US leadership.",
    "story": [
      "America is under new management. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is joining a growing list of US allies who are finding that the world according to Donald Trump is a colder, more uncertain and potentially more dangerous place for them.",
      "It must have been bad enough for Zelensky to hear Trump's abrupt announcement that he had welcomed Russia's President Vladimir Putin back to international diplomacy with a 90-minute phone call, to be followed by a face-to-face meeting, perhaps in Saudi Arabia.",
      "After Putin, the White House dialled up Zelensky's number. Speaking to journalists in Ukraine the morning after, Zelensky accepted the fact that Putin received the first call, \"although to be honest, it's not very pleasant\".",
      "What stung Zelensky more was that Trump, who rang him after he spoke to Putin, seemed to regard him, at best, as a junior adjunct to any peace talks. One of Zelensky's many nightmares must be the prospect of Trump and Putin attempting to settle Ukraine's future without anyone else in the negotiation.",
      "He told the journalists that Ukraine \"will not be able to accept any agreements\" made without its involvement.",
      "It was vital, he said, that \"everything does not go according to Putin's plan, in which he wants to do everything to make his negotiations bilateral\".",
      "Follow the latest updates from the Munich Security Conference",
      "Follow the latest updates from the Munich Security Conference",
      "President Zelensky is heading to the Munich security conference, starting on Friday, where he will attempt to rally Ukraine's allies. He faces a tough meeting with Trump's vice president, JD Vance, who was one of the sternest critics of Joe Biden's aid to Ukraine.",
      "The argument Zelensky will hear from the Americans is that Ukraine is losing and it needs to get real about what happens next. He will argue that Ukraine can win - with the right backing.",
      "The European Union is worried too. After meeting and praising the Ukrainian defence minister Rustem Umerov, the EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas posted that Europe must have a central role in any negotiation. \"Our priority now must be strengthening Ukraine and providing robust security guarantees,\" Kallas said.",
      "Zelensky is painfully aware that while his European allies are sounding much more steadfast than the Americans, the US remains the world's strongest military power. He told the Guardian last week that \"security guarantees without America are not real security guarantees\".",
      "Collectively, European allies have given Ukraine more money than the US. But the Americans have weapons and air defence systems - like the Patriot missile batteries that protect Kyiv - that Europeans simply cannot provide.",
      "Putin will be delighted that he is getting a much easier ride than he had from Biden. The former US president called Putin, among other things, a \"pure thug\", a \"brutal tyrant\" and a \"murderous dictator\" and cut off contact after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Just to drive home the point that everything had changed, Trump followed up yesterday's positive assessment of his talk with Putin with an upbeat early morning post on his platform, Truth Social, reflecting on \"great talks with Russia and Ukraine yesterday\". There was now a \"good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war!!!\"",
      "Putin is not just back in conversation with the most powerful country in the world. With Trump, he may now see himself as the arbiter of the endgame in the war he started when he broke international law with the all-out invasion of Ukraine almost exactly three years ago.",
      "At the White House, Trump seemed to suggest that the huge numbers of dead and wounded in the Russian military gave some kind of legitimacy to Putin's demand to keep the land captured and annexed by Russia.",
      "\"They took a lot of land and they fought for that land,\" Trump said. As for Ukraine, \"some of it will come back\".",
      "His defence secretary Pete Hegseth's remarks at a Nato meeting in Brussels were more direct. He wanted Ukraine to be \"sovereign and prosperous\". But \"we must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective\".",
      "\"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.\"",
      "Trump is still at the easy end of what could become an impossibly tough diplomatic challenge. Boasting that he has the key to ending the Russo-Ukraine war is one thing. Making that happen is something else.",
      "His declaration before any talks with Russia start that Ukraine will not join Nato nor get back all its occupied land has been widely criticised as a poor start by a man who claims to be the world's best dealmaker.",
      "The veteran Swedish diplomat and politician Carl Bildt posted an ironic rebuke on X.",
      "\"It's certainly an innovative approach to a negotiation to make very major concessions even before they have started. Not even Chamberlain went that low in 1938. That Munich ended very bad anyhow.\"",
      "Bildt posted a photo of Britain's then prime minister Neville Chamberlain on his return from Munich in 1938, waving the notorious and worthless agreement he had made with Adolf Hitler - the price of which was the capitulation and break-up of Czechoslovakia and a faster slide towards a second world war.",
      "After the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Vladimir Putin was widely portrayed in the west as the new threat to European peace. Trump's approach to him is very different.",
      "He will have to try to bridge the gap between Putin and Zelensky's positions, which are polar opposites.",
      "Zelensky's declared objective is to regain Ukraine's lost territory, which amounts to around a fifth of its total land mass. He also wants Ukraine to become a full member of Nato.",
      "Putin insists that any peace deal would require Ukraine to give up the land Russia has captured, as well as areas it has not occupied, including the city of Zaporizhzhia which has a population of more than half a million. Ukraine would also become neutral, demilitarised and would never join Nato.",
      "Ukraine's demands will not be acceptable to Moscow, and Trump has indicated he doesn't like them either.",
      "But Russia's amount to an ultimatum, not a serious peace proposal. Trump, once a developer, likes deals that involve tangible real estate. But Putin wants more than land. He wants Ukraine to go back to the relationship it had with the Kremlin during the days when it was part of the Soviet Union. For that to happen, Ukraine would have to lose its independence and sovereignty.",
      "Biden offered Ukraine enough not to lose, because he took Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons if Nato intervened seriously. Trump must be aware of nuclear danger, but he also believes backing Ukraine indefinitely is a bad deal for the US, and he can do better.",
      "As for the Europeans, he might force them to face up to the gross disparity between their military promises to Ukraine and their military capabilities. Only Poland and the Baltic states are backing their public statements about the threat from Russia with qualitatively increased defence spending.",
      "With Russia grinding forward on the battlefields of eastern Ukraine, this is the toughest moment Zelensky will have faced since the dark and desperate first months of the war, when Ukraine fought off Russia's attack on Kyiv.",
      "It is also a moment of decision for his western allies. They face tough choices that cannot be put off much longer.",
      "Europe caught out by Trump's Russia move",
      "'It's a new reality' - US stance on Ukraine a bitter blow to Zelensky",

      "The War and Treaty's road to success",
      "The duo's journey in music started at a music festival in Maryland, where Tanya was immediately captivated by Michael.",

      "They married in 2011, but it wasn't until three years later that they started singing together.",
      "Their path to success wasn't easy as they faced challenges both in their personal lives and careers. Michael, a U.S. Army veteran who saw combat in Iraq, struggled with PTSD, while Tanya battled depression and suicide attempts.",
      "Despite these hardships, the couple found strength in their relationship and in their music.",
      "Tanya's own experience with the music industry wasn't without its challenges. Having had a promising career in music, she walked away from the industry due to its pressures.",

      "Even so, Tanya and Michael find strength in their music. Tanya admits that their challenges are part of what makes their sound so powerful.",

      "Their unique blend of country, R&B, and gospel influences helped them find their place in the music world. Michael credits the blues as a guiding force, drawing inspiration from legends like James Brown and Ray Charles.",
      "\"This is where the War and Treaty should exist,\" Michael said, reflecting on their musical journey.",
      "They struggled to find a home in R&B or gospel, but said\u00a0the country music world embraced them. They toured with Chris Stapleton and sang with the Brothers Osborne on the CMA Awards.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 14:44:47 -0500",
    "summary": "The beloved weekly magazine encompassing journalism, fiction, poetry and cartoons, is celebrating its centenary. New Yorker writer Kelefa Sanneh goes inside the magazine's history to explore its longevity, national reach, and idiosyncratic appeal.",
    "story": [
      "The New Yorker, the beloved weekly magazine, is celebrating its one-hundredth birthday. I have been a staff writer at the magazine since 2008, and Bruce Diones has been at The New Yorker since, well, not quite since the beginning. \"1978,\" he said. \"I was in the cradle. They left me on the doorstep and I came.\"",
      "Asked his title, Diones replied , \"I don't really have one. I aid and abet all the crimes that happen here. I'm that guy that's always around.\"",
      "\"An expert on both the people and the magazine?\"",
      "\"That's right.\"",
      "\"You can tell me what we published in 1979, but you can also tell me who's mad at whom?\"",
      "\"Yeah, and I can tell you why they're mad at them and why that thing in '79 didn't work out!\" he laughed.",
      "The New Yorker is known for its reporting, and for its idiosyncrasies. Each issue also includes cartoons, a short story, and a few poems. The front cover features not a photograph, but a painting.",
      "One of Diones' many responsibilities is to organize the magazine's archive. \"We have every magazine, every issue since the first one. We have scrapbooks, papers and all sorts of weird little ephemera from the people's offices. It's kind of fun, interesting stuff.\"",
      "The New Yorker may be America's leading literary magazine, but its story starts with an artist: Rea Irvin. \"All the artwork in The New Yorker is based on his work,\" Diones said.",
      "Irvin did the cover of the first issue published on February 21, 1925, of a fancy young man in a top hat, inspecting a butterfly. His name is Eustace Tilley, and he became the magazine's mascot, for better or worse.",
      "\"At long last, I'm gonna tell you that I'm ambivalent about Eustace Tilley,\" said editor David Remnick. \"Because some people look at it and they think it's a symbol of snobbery, or overweening pride. When it began, it was meant to be a joke about snobbery.\"",
      "Remnick was a 39-year-old reporter when, in 1998, he was named the fifth editor of The New Yorker. His job is to keep the writers happy, and, as he sometimes reminds me, productive. His job is also to figure how, and how much, to modernize a 100-year-old magazine that once specialized in light-hearted articles about Manhattan society.",
      "In that first issue of the magazine, founding editor Harold Ross wrote, \"It is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque.\"",
      "I asked, \"What did he have against Iowa?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" Remnick laughed. \"To him, Dubuque included Queens, Los Angeles \u2026\"",
      "The magazine's reach, now, extends far past Manhattan. \"We have more readers in the state of California than we do in the state of New York, including the old lady in Dubuque,\" Remnick said. \"It's a magazine that has deep, deep reporting, and prides itself on accuracy and fact-checking.\"",
      "Fergus McIntosh leads the magazine's battalion of fact-checkers \u2013 more than two dozen.",
      "So, what is a fact-checker? \"Somebody who takes a story submitted by someone like you and, before we publish it, makes sure that it is accurate, balanced, fair, and as complete as it can be,\" McIntosh said.",
      "\"Fair? That seems like a hard thing to figure out,\" I said.",
      "\"I know that's hard for you. It's not hard for us,\" McIntosh laughed.",
      "And everything gets checked \u2013 not just articles, but also poems, short stories, even cartoons. Teresa Mathew, the department's associate director, remembers one cartoon about a penguin meeting his girlfriend's parents. \"He says, 'We prefer the term Arctic-American,'\" she recalled. \"And this is factually incorrect, because penguins live in the Antarctic.\"",
      "\"But Antarctic-American wouldn't have been as funny,\" I said.",
      "\"Not pithy enough, no,\" said Mathew. \"All of my emails to the wonderful cartoon editor about any potential issues I find, almost always I get a response of, 'Thank you so much, Teresa. We will not be taking that change.'\"",
      "Somewhere along the way, The New Yorker became a serious magazine, publishing writers ranging from J.D. Salinger to James Baldwin, from the film critic Pauline Kael to the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow.",
      "The New York Public Library will celebrate the magazine's anniversary with an exhibition later this month.",
      "So, what is The New Yorker in 2025? Remnick said, \"It's not just one thing. Sports illustrated was about one thing, and it's easy to understand, for advertisers and readers. [The New Yorker] is a more complicated thing. It may be a little bit tricky to invite people in.\"",
      "\"Is The New Yorker itself more political than it used to be?\"",
      "\"I think it's certainly more political than when it started out, that's for damn sure,\" said Remnick.",
      "\"Would it be wrong to describe The New Yorker as a liberal magazine?\"",
      "\"No, I don't think it would be wrong. I think there a wide range. I don't think it's an assertively ideological publication. I think reporting is at its center more than finger-wagging.\"",
      "These are anxious times for the media industry, and The New Yorker is not immune. The magazine had a round of layoffs in 2023. But The New Yorker has a steady base of around 1.2 million subscribers, many of whom read it on their phones. Remnick said, \"How do we write shorter, faster things, as well as do the other things? In addition to; it's not instead of. We have a pretty robust audio operation \u2013 four, five podcasts. We do video. But I'm thinking forward. I'm thinking about how do we have a New Yorker that has the possibility of celebrating 200 years? Because in American life, in the history of media, that's unusual. Just ask the people who used to read Life magazine.\"",
      "For Bruce Diones, The New Yorker's 100th birthday is a good excuse to revisit ancient history. He showed me a box left behind by a former employee named Fred Keefe: \"He was a little guy like me with a bow tie, and he would sit in the corner and type out 'letters to the editor' answers.\"",
      "One letter was a request to visit the magazine's offices. Keefe responded: \"Thank you for your letter. We're afraid there isn't much to see in our offices. The editors and writers are all shut away in little cubicles and are very upset if people pop in on them.\"",
      "In fact, those old editors and writers and artists and cartoonists are still here, in spirit, and also in these boxes. The party's been going for a hundred years, and new people are still being invited to join in.",
      "I said, \"maybe in another 100 years, someone will come and flip through whatever the newest version of that archives is?\"",
      "\"That's right, and I'm in it now,\" laughed Diones. \"And you're in it, too. That's kind of the thrill of it. You realize that, well, oh, this has always been going on, and we're all a part of it.\"",

      "Taylor Swift was back at the Super Bowl to watch Travis Kelce and his Kansas City Chiefs play the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. Her reception was a whole lot different than last year.",
      "The pop superstar, who was cheered loudly when she showed up at the big game in Las Vegas, was instead booed by the heavily pro-Eagles crowd when shown on the video boards inside the Superdome during a break in the first quarter.",
      "Sitting next to rapper Ice Spice, Swift gave a bit of a side-eye and wrinkled her nose when she realized the booing was directed at her.",
      "President Trump, who attended the game, suggested she was booed by his supporters. Swift\u00a0endorsed Joe Biden\u00a0in 2020 and\u00a0Kamala Harris in 2024. Mr. Trump said on his Truth Social site that, \"The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!\"",
      "Swift and Kelce have been a sports-and-entertainment power couple since early last season, when the four-time All-Pro tight end invited the now-14-time Grammy Award winner to watch him play in a matchup with the Bears. Kelce had famously tried to deliver a friendship bracelet to Swift when she played at Arrowhead Stadium, only to be thwarted.",
      "Their relationship blossomed as the Chiefs pursued their second consecutive Super Bowl last year, and Swift was part of the on-field celebration on a cold night in Baltimore when the Chiefs beat the Ravens to win the AFC championship.",
      "Then came Swift's star turn at the big game in Las Vegas.",
      "She was in the midst of her Eras Tour and had played a concert in Tokyo the same weekend. Swift made a mad dash from there to the airport, hopped a private jet to Los Angeles, and made it to Las Vegas with time to spare. Once inside Allegiant Stadium, fans and TV cameras watched Swift win a beer-chugging contest, party with celebrity friends such as Blake Lively and Lana Del Rey, and eventually make her way to the field following the Chiefs' 25-22 win over the 49ers.",
      "Kelce and Swift celebrated by locking lips as red and gold confetti fell around them like rain.",
      "There was no closely watched trip around the globe this week, though.",
      "Swift arrived in the Big Easy in time to join Kelce on a double date with Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, on the players' night off Friday. The couples dined at Lilette, a French restaurant near the Garden District.",
      "On the eve of the big game, Swift was spotted with musicians Danielle and Alana Haim at Gianna Restaurant.",
      "The big question swirling Sunday was not whether Swift would make it to the game, like last year, but what could happen if she found herself on the field afterward, celebrating Kelce's third straight Super Bowl title and fourth overall. That didn't happen.",
      "The 35-year-old Kelce has been noncommittal about playing next year, and some within the Chiefs organization are bracing for his potential retirement. Kelce has been laying the groundwork for his post-playing career, building a lucrative podcast with his brother, retired Eagles center Jason Kelce, and appearing on \"Saturday Night Live\" and other TV shows.",
      "Then there's the question of whether Kelce might pop the question. According to BetMGM, those willing to gamble on his plans could get 8/1 odds that Kelce would propose to Swift with a Chiefs victory.",
      "The Chiefs were 19-3 with her in the crowd, including 9-0 this season. She had never seen them lose in the playoffs.",

    "story": [
      "Before gracing such grand venues as the Academy Awards, Cynthia Erivo could be found at the Stratford East Theatre in London, not far from where she grew up, and where she'd filled any role she could: \"Working the bar or being an usher. And when I got to be in a play, I was so happy. That was a big deal for me.\"",
      "The talent that made her a big deal is undeniable \u2013 a dynamic vocalist who convincingly took on the role of Aretha Franklin, one of the many portrayals garnering Erivo critical acclaim.",
      "Erivo performs Aretha Franklin's \"How I Got Over\" in the 2021 miniseries \"Genius: Aretha\":",
      "Asked if she recognizes how special her voice is, Erivo replied, \"What I think is most special is what I get back from people, the connections that get made. That's the thing I'm always looking for.\"",
      "She connected with Broadway audiences in \"The Color Purple,\" earning a Grammy, an Emmy, and a Tony Award.",
      "And now, she's starring in the film \"Wicked,\" which has 10 Oscar nominations, including best actress for Erivo. Opposite Ariana Grande, Erivo plays Elphaba, in this prequel to \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Elphaba battles being an outcast and discovers her inner strength:",
      "Excerpt: Cynthia Erivo performs \"Defying Gravity,\" from \"Wicked\":",
      "Fans has posted online their own renditions of \"Defying Gravity.\" \"It's really fun that people have taken it and made it their own,\" Erivo said. \"And I'm glad that that moment brings so much joy to people.\"",
      "\"What do you think you brought to Elphaba?\" I asked.",
      "\"The vulnerability, her humanity,\" she said.",
      "\"What's that vulnerability for you personally?\"",
      "\"I think always wanting to do well and not wanting to fail, not wanting to let family down. Those are the insecurities. Finally owning how I look.\"",
      "\"What do you mean by that?\"",
      "\"Well, I think we're not necessarily told that, you know, dark-skinned Black girls are the prettiest girls,\" Erivo said. \"And the only person that really is telling you, thankfully, is your mother. It's up to you to figure out that for yourself, and to start owning what beauty is to you.\"",
      "\"You're really close with your mom. You're not with your dad?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"As you've gone on to have more and more success and visibility, how much do you think about your dad?\"",
      "\"I don't necessarily think about him too much, only that I wish him well,\" Erivo said. \"When I was a teenager, [I was] very angry at what that relationship was. That sort of fractured relationship I have with him, I think, originally was one of the driving forces of, you know, you want to do well because you want to prove that you're good enough to be loved. But then, you have to start learning how to do it for you.\"",
      "\"What happened with your dad?\"",
      "\"We had a falling-out that just never repaired,\" she said.",
      "\"And he just left early on?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"It's interesting that you trace some of your desire to find success to a desire to \u2013\"",
      "\"To be loved,\" Erivo said.",
      "The 38-year-old lives in Los Angeles, but grew up in London. \"London really is kind of what made me,\" she said.",
      "Her parents were immigrants from Nigeria. Her mother's drive for a better life was formative. \"My mom made a decision because she wanted more for herself. To do that is a really brave thing. And I think that watching her do that made me do the same \u2013 you sort of are given the tools to be determined enough to go after your dreams.\"",
      "Her roles show range: Her portrayal of abolitionist Harriet Tubman in the 2019 film \"Harriet\" led to her first Academy Award nominations, for best actress and best original song, and secured her a place on the red carpet, where she speaks through another sort of language: fashion. \"I think they're the words without the words,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"What do you feel like you say with how you dress?\"",
      "\"I think I tell people I'm a bit of a daredevil, that I am a kind rebel!\" she replied.",
      "Incredibly, she dared to sing live on the \"Wicked\" set while flying in a harness.",
      "I asked, \"How does singing live in a film like that change the final product?\"",
      "\"Well, you can play,\" she said. \"It means that you can act on impulse. \u2026 You have more breath, more space.\"",
      "\"It lets the performance change?\"",
      "\"That's right. Moment to moment.\"",
      "\"And presumably it lets more of you \u2013\"",
      "\"\u2026 out!\"",
      "Lately, Erivo is letting more of herself out \u2013 releasing an album later this year. Then, there's part two of \"Wicked,\" opening in November.",
      "\"I feel really open,\" she said. \"I felt more myself then ever in this sort of last couple of years. It makes things a lot more fun, you know?\"",
      "\"And maybe gives another meaning or undertone or something to this 'defying gravity'?\" I asked.",

    "summary": "Stephanie Courtney (Flo, the Progressive Insurance saleswoman), Dean Winters (Mayhem, of Allstate insurance commercials), and Deanna Colon (the unstoppable dancer in Jardiance diabetes drug ads) talk about their fame as pitch people.",
    "story": [
      "You know those Progressive Insurance commercials? Comedian Stephanie Courtney has played Flo the Insurance Woman in 215 ads, so far. She's helped turn Progressive into America's second-largest insurance company.",
      "She is, by any measure, one of the most successful actors in the world \u2013 on television nonstop for 16 years, with face recognition by the public, and the money that goes with it. \"I'm not gonna fight you on that!\" Courtney laughed. \"Even though in my head I'm like, What?\"",
      "I asked, \"What does it mean when you go out in public? Do people harass you? Want selfies?\"",
      "\"No, not really,\" she said. \"Normally I look like a sea hag. So, I get a double life.\"",
      "She's come a long way since 2007: \"I was broke as a joke. I was auditioning. I was driving around L.A. auditioning for every commercial, every show.\"",
      "Being called a struggling actor, Courtney said, would be a compliment. \"I would've aspired to be a struggling actor!\" she laughed. \"And then, I got the audition for Progressive.\"",
      "That first ad wasn't intended to be funny. But then came the ad-lib that changed advertising history: \"I remember the first actor, his line after I tell him the whole thing is, 'Wow.' And he said, 'Wow.' And I'm like, 'WOW! I know! I say it louder!' I was kind of shocked at how I screamed in this actor's face.",
      "\"And so, that's the first clue about, like, who is she, how crazy can she get,\" she said.",
      "Viewers loved Flo, and a commercial icon was born.",
      "You may know Dean Winters from his roles on \"Oz,\" \"30 Rock,\" or \"John Wick.\" But you're most likely to know him from the 150 TV ads he's made for Allstate. He plays Mayhem, the human embodiment of every risky person, place, or thing in your life. \"It's like, 'Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem!' I can't even ride the subway anymore,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Does it bother you at all that you're getting recognized more for an ad campaign?\"",
      "\"I think in the beginning, maybe a little bit,\" Winters replied. \"But I wouldn't have the lifestyle that I live if it wasn't for people watching the commercials, watching the TV shows and movies, paying for their insurance. So, every time someone stops me, my first thought is, this person is helping me pay my mortgage!\"",
      "The luxury of having a side hustle is not lost on Winters: \"It's a very fickle business,\" he said. \"You can go six months, eight months without working, easily. A lot of my friends are struggling right now. And so, like, I'm very cognizant of how lucky I am. it's become, like, the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\"",
      "But if anyone knows about the ups and downs of showbiz, it's Deanna Colon. \"I am a 360-degree entertainer, singer, songwriter, vocal coach,\" she said. \"If you want to be in the world of entertainment, you have to do it all.\"",
      "Colon was on \"America's Got Talent,\" and she's appeared in ads for Pepsi and Big Lots. But the biggest break she ever got was the Jardiance commercial.",
      "\"I have Type 2 diabetes, but I manage it well, it's a little pill with a big story to tell!\"",
      "\"I'm dancing with my mailman and I'm, 'Hey, how you doing buddy?' And she's living her best life!\" Colon said.",
      "The ad aired in March 2023. And aired, and aired, and aired. \"Apparently they showed it one million times,\" she laughed. \"People were yelling at me online, 'I'm so sick of seeing your face!' And I'm like, 'I have no power in how much they air this thing, guys!'\"",
      "Commercial pay can be pretty good: \"With Big Lots, I made over a hundred thousand dollars in a three-month period,\" she said. \"Plus, you get the health insurance. Yeah, it's awesome.\"",
      "What wasn't so awesome was the online hate that the Jardiance ad brought her.\u00a0 \"I would get emails to my personal website that were horrible, and I'd just be crying,\" Colon said. \"It was mostly about my weight and how, you know, 'Oh, if you danced like that all the time, you wouldn't be the size you are.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you do anything differently now that you know how toxic and horrific some people can be?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"I'm always gonna be a plus-size woman. I'm always gonna be a curvy woman. And you're gonna see me singing and dancing and acting. The joy of it all far outweighs the haters.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dean Winters will be Mayhem for as long as Allstate will have him. \"You know, I really hope that I'm doing it until Mayhem is wheelchair racing in a nursing home, you know what I mean?\" he laughed.",
      "As for Stephanie Courtney, she's given up her youthful dreams of appearing on Broadway or on \"Saturday Night Live.\" But she still performs every week with The Groundlings improv group.",
      "And she still loves being Flo. \"I will tell you, the thing that made my heart grow three sizes that day was the Halloween costumes, seeing, especially like little kids, I love it so much,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm like, 'Just keep reapplying powder, reapply your lipstick. Go forth, be free, go spread the word!'\" Courtney laughed.",

    "story": [
      "Muhammed Ali is considered one of the greatest boxers of all time. But he also packed a punch with art works, like this 1967 drawing called \"The Crowd,\" seen from his perspective looking out from the ring, with some in the audience smiling, some frowning. \"I love that part where he is acknowledging that not only did he have fans, but he might have had some haters as well,\" said curator Arden Sherman.",
      "Four of Ali's works are prominently featured in \u00a0\"Strike Fast, Dance Lightly: Artists on Boxing,\"\u00a0at the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Florida. It's an exhibition devoted to boxing \u2013 winners, losers, and everything in-between.",
      "Sherman says the show explores a host of different aspects about this most accessible of sports: \"It's rare to encounter a human of a certain age on this planet that doesn't have an understanding of the sport of boxing,\" she said.",
      "Artists do seem to gravitate toward boxing. There are more than 100 works on display here \u2013 paintings, photographs and sculptures \u2013 including many by and about women. One work by Zoe Buchman features frilly fabrics on boxing gloves. Sherman said. \"She's someone who is consistently standing up for female rights and female empowerment.\"",
      "Sherman says the exhibit comes at a very auspicious time: \"I believe, as humans, we find ourselves fighting for something or defending another thing. It is a contentious moment we live in, and what better way to express that but through the symbolism granted to us through the sport of boxing.\"",
      "So, the give-and-take in works like this, by George Bellows, perhaps America's best-known painter of boxing, seems to take on new meaning.",
      "This 1923 work, called \"Introducing John L. Sullivan,\" depicts not just a famous boxer and the announcer, but also the promoters, money makers, and wheeler-dealers behind all of it.",
      "The exhibit features some heavyweight artists: There's Roy Lichtenstein's \"Sweet Dreams Baby!\" from 1965, and Keith Haring's late 1980s painted steel sculpture.",
      "Sherman says the artists are \"thinking about love, violence, fantasy, death. \u2026 I think the artists are thinking about being alive. I think they are thinking about their own identity, and how they navigate that in this world.\"",
      "Among the most recent works is a pair of paintings from 2023 by Jared McGriff. \"One of the things about boxing and this act of being in a battle is that it can be disorienting,\" he said. \"The thing that I think about with these two works is this idea of internal struggle and the idea of what it takes from an internal determination and focus standpoint to reach this level of athleticism.\"",
      "There are also flashes of humor, such as Michael Halsband's 1985 photo of artists Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat in boxing gear:",

      "Those flocks were infected by B3.13, state veterinarian Hallie Hasel tells CBS News. It is unclear whether the human bird flu patient in Colorado was also infected by B3.13.",
      "A spokesperson for the CDC, which usually studies and sequences worrying bird flu cases, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "summary": "The NGO Doctors for America argued that HHS, CDC and FDA violated federal law in removing medical information from public-facing websites.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration to restore webpages and data that had been scrubbed in compliance with President Trump's executive order on gender ideology\u00a0while litigation moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Bates agreed to grant a temporary restraining order sought by the group Doctors for America, which argued that its members used the websites when treating patients and conducting research. The nonprofit organization said that the removal of the webpages by the Department of Health and Human Services and its components violated federal law.",
      "Bates found that the challengers were likely to succeed in their claims that the Department Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA acted unlawfully when they stripped medical information from public-facing websites.",
      "\"It bears emphasizing who ultimately bears the harm of defendants' actions: everyday Americans, and most acutely, underprivileged Americans, seeking healthcare,\" he wrote. Citing declarations from two doctors filed in the case, Bates said if they \"cannot provide these individuals the care they need (and deserve) within the scheduled and often limited time frame, there is a chance that some individuals will not receive treatment, including for severe, life-threatening conditions. The public thus has a strong interest in avoiding these serious injuries to the public health.\"",
      "His order directs the agencies to restore earlier versions of their websites by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. It comes after Bates held a hearing on the matter Monday.",
      "Signed on his first day in office, Mr. Trump's executive order on gender ideology stated that the U.S. recognizes two sexes, male and female, and it directed agencies to remove \"all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\"",
      "Days after the president issued his order, the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum ordering all agencies by 5 p.m. on Jan. 31 to take down all websites, social media accounts and other public-facing media \"that inculcate or promote gender ideology.\" In response to the memo, the CDC and FDA took offline numerous webpages and data sets, including recommendations on how physicians should treat sexually transmitted infections and adult immunization guidance.",
      "While the wording on some websites was adjusted to adhere to Mr. Trump's directive, allowing them to stay online, other information, like data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, was removed completely.",
      "The agency said in a banner on its main website that it was \"being modified to comply with President Trump's executive orders.\"",
      "Doctors for America filed its lawsuit against the health agencies on Feb. 4, alleging they violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process and another that requires federal agencies to ensure the public has \"timely and equitable access\" to their public information.",
      "The group argued in court papers that its members relied on the scrubbed information to provide treatment, conduct research and inform public health responses on topics like youth risk behaviors, adolescent health and HIV.",
      "Doctors for America said some of its members were already experiencing challenges as a result of losing access to information from the CDC. In one instance, it said a Chicago-based physician who works at a clinic serving low-income immigrant families could not consult the CDC's website for resources on how to address a chlamydia outbreak at a local high school and bolster STI testing and prevention efforts.",
      "Another doctor, who is also a researcher at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a declaration that she lost the ability to consult CDC resources about prescribing treatments.",
      "\"These doctors' time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\" Bates wrote.",
      "He said that the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA face a minimal burden if required to store access to health resources, which have been available to the public for years.",
      "\"There is nothing in either the OPM memorandum or the record, and indeed defendants proffered no information at the hearing, to suggest the restoration of the removed webpages would pose a burden on the agencies' ability to engage in their work,\" Bates wrote. \"Similarly, there is no information to suggest that restoring public access would even interfere with the agencies' ongoing efforts to conform those resources with the president's executive orders.\"",
      "The order from Bates comes as Mr. Trump has faced numerous setbacks in the courts stemming from lawsuits targeting his administration's actions. On Monday alone, five different judges took action that favored challenges to Mr. Trump's directives on birthright citizenship, a freeze on federal funding, cuts to how medical research grants are funded and his deferred resignation program.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. confirmed at least a dozen deaths from whooping cough last year, according to preliminary figures released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That marks the most fatalities from the bacterial infection since a 2017 surge of the illness, which is also known as pertussis.",
      "Over the last month, pertussis infections have been rising again. While cases reported to the CDC by health departments dipped over the winter holidays, weekly infections have accelerated for a month straight since then.",
      "At least 360 pertussis cases were reported nationwide in last week's update to the CDC's tally of infections. Cases are up 27% from the week before.",
      "Weekly cases peaked at 577 late last year, before plummeting to less than 200 over the New Year's holiday.",
      "Florida reported 44 cases last week, the most of any state. That displaces Ohio, which had been the state with the most pertussis infections for many recent weeks.",
      "Cases have been reported in counties throughout Florida, according to data from the state's health department, with the largest tallies around Miami and Tampa.",
      "Similar to other states, most cases reported in Florida have been in children under 5 years old. More than a third of whooping cough cases have been in older kids.",
      "\"People of all ages are at risk for getting pertussis (whooping cough). Everyone who is not up to date with whooping cough vaccination should get vaccinated,\" CDC spokesperson Paul Prince said in a statement.",
      "Whooping cough can initially be difficult to separate from other cold-causing germs that surge over the colder months. Pertussis infections are called whooping cough because of the sound of severe coughing attacks, which can linger for weeks.",
      "Some people are at higher risk of life-threatening complications from whooping cough infections, including babies and people who are not up to date on their vaccines.",
      "Prince, the CDC spokesperson, said data on pertussis deaths for January 2025 was not available. Whooping cough deaths can take several weeks to be confirmed.",
      "A local health department earlier this month in Washington announced the first whooping cough death in the state since 2011. A 5-year-old had died in November 2024, but was only confirmed as a pertussis death by the CDC in recent weeks.",
      "The child had not completed the pertussis vaccine series, the Spokane Regional Health District said in a release, and also had \"other health factors that contributed\" to their death.",
      "\"This death serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vaccination, especially for those who are most vulnerable, including infants and young children,\" Dr. Francisco Velazquez, the county's health officer, said in a statement.",
      "Officials have warned for months that the U.S. was likely on track to see a major wave in whooping cough cases. While infections usually climb every three to five years, pertussis was among many germs that were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Other changes have also driven up pertussis cases in recent years, including a change in 2020 intended to cut down on missed cases by epidemiologists and waning immunity from pertussis vaccines.",
      "\"We have been seeing some increase in pertussis cases that are coming through our emergency departments. Not necessarily requiring admission, but coming in for evaluation and treatment,\" said Dr. Marcos Mestre, chief clinical operations officer at Nicklaus Children's Health System in Miami.",
      "He said it had been many years since they had seen a major outbreak of pertussis infections, as opposed to \"little pockets of increases\" around their system.",
      "Mestre said older pertussis patients often come into the emergency room after facing a persistent cough that does not go away after a week or so. Younger babies come in to get evaluated sooner and are at higher risk.",
      "\"They're coughing to the point that they can't catch their breath. And those are the children we really worry about, when infants are getting infected and that could cause more severe illness,\" said Mestre.",
      "Caregivers are urged to get up to date on their vaccines because that can reduce the risk of passing on an infection to young children, Mestre said. Pregnant moms who get vaccinated also pass on immunity to their children, protecting them as soon as they are born.",
      "\"It's important that people understand that immunity wanes, even if you are vaccinated as a child. And if you are going to be around infants, we recommend vaccination every 10 years,\" he said.",

      "As outlined in an NIH memo, it would cap the amount of funding for what are called \"indirect costs,\" for general expenses like facilities and administration, at 15%, down from an average of around 27 to 28%.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's pick to head the department that oversees the NIH, may undo the cuts, according to Sen. Susan Collins. The Senate is expected to vote by Thursday on whether to confirm Kennedy, after his nomination cleared the Senate's finance committee\u00a0last week.",
      "\"He has promised that as soon as he is confirmed, he will re-examine this initiative that was implemented prior to his confirmation,\" the Maine Republican said in a statement.

Research for curing cancer and addressing chronic health conditions like diabetes and heart disease would be among the projects impacted, the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities warned.",
      "The cost-cutting move implements an idea floated by conservatives for years. During President Trump's first term, the White House proposed sharply limiting the indirect costs paid by the NIH to 10%.",

      "Recipients of federal research dollars rejected characterizing the reimbursements as unnecessary, saying they are often needed to pay for costs like utility costs and lab maintenance and security.",
      "Those \"facilities and administration\" costs are difficult to attribute to on paper as direct costs of the research, they said, but are needed for the studies to continue.",
      "\"Make no mistake. This announcement will mean less research. Lights in labs nationwide will literally go out. Researchers and staff will lose their jobs,\" said the Association of American Medical Colleges in a statement.",

      "The Children's Hospital Association\u00a0asked\u00a0on Monday for lawmakers \"to prevent unilateral changes in the established processes\" for determining the indirect rates, citing \"current law and longstanding Congressional intent.\"",
      "\"Reducing the indirect cost rate will threaten the ability of children's hospitals to provide future groundbreaking cures for children,\" the association said.",
      "For years, lawmakers from both parties have opposed efforts to cut NIH's funding of indirect costs, including in a clause added to a budget bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress in 2017.",
      "Grogan criticized the move, saying it blocked \"a rational discussion of how indirect cost rates should be calculated\" and efforts to ease unnecessary regulations.",
      "\"It's time for a transparent bipartisan discussion of whether taxpayers are getting cutting edge research out of NIH,\" said Grogan in an email.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down\"",
      "Current and former health officials say they were blindsided by the guidance change, which upends a long-running system by which federal authorities already carefully scrutinize and negotiate down how much funding goes to indirect costs.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down,\" said one former federal health official, who had worked with the team responsible for auditing indirect costs on NIH's behalf for years.",
      "That process starts with an extensive proposal submitted by researchers that goes through the federal Cost Allocation Services team within HHS, officials said, seeking to justify how they are planning to use the funds from a grant.",

      "A dairy worker in Nevada has been confirmed to be infected by a new bird flu strain found to be spreading among\u00a0cows in the state last week.",
      "That strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus, called D1.1 by scientists, is different from a previous variant called B3.13 which had infected at least 40 dairy workers in the U.S. to date.",
      "D1.1 was also behind a\u00a0fatal case in Louisiana in a person who was hospitalized last year, raising concerns that the strain might lead to more severe disease in humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 14 other cases last year have also been linked to D1.1 from birds, which did not result in hospitalization.",
      "B3.13 has led to only symptoms of conjunctivitis \u2014 or pink eye \u2014 in many cases and research suggests it is less severe for humans than other bird flu strains.",
      "So far, health authorities in Nevada say the dairy worker, who tested positive after working with sick cows in the state's Churchill County, had only pink eye as their symptom and is now recovering.",
      "\"There is currently no evidence of person to person spread of this virus. Close contacts of the infected person and other workers exposed at the farm are being contacted and monitored for symptoms and are being offered personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and antiviral medication,\" the Central Nevada Health District said in a statement.",

      "Will vaccines work for D1.1?",
      "While the seasonal flu vaccine is not designed to boost protection against H5N1, there are different kinds of vaccines that health authorities have prepared for a potential bird flu pandemic.",
      "Health authorities routinely test those pandemic vaccines against the bird flu virus to see if new strains have evolved to escape the protection from those shots.",
      "Previous testing by the CDC with D1.1 strains spreading in wild birds have found that the pandemic vaccines stockpiled by the U.S. government should still offer protection, two health officials told CBS News.",

      "Under the Biden administration last year, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response moved to prepare enough vials to vaccinate 2.4 million people if needed \u2014 but so far those doses have not been distributed for use.",
      "Officials said at the time that there was not yet a need to roll out the immunizations, citing the largely mild symptoms in infected workers and lack of human-to-human spread.",
      "Virtually all U.S. human cases of bird flu have been linked to direct contact with sick animals, often during intensive exposures like caring directly for sick animals or culling large flocks of infected birds. That includes the person who died in the Louisiana case, who had direct contact with sick birds.",

    "summary": "A program begun in Zimbabwe in which grandmothers and older listeners serve as \"first responders\" for those seeking mental health assistance in underserved communities has now expanded to nine countries, including the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Dixon Chibanda remembers like yesterday the moment in 2005 that changed his life. \"During my formative years working as a psychiatrist, I lost a patient of mine to suicide. Erica was her name. She had hanged herself from a mango tree in the family garden.\"",
      "Erica was just 25 years old.",
      "Chibanda, a psychiatrist based in Harare, Zimbabwe, says her family knew she needed help. \"They lived some 200 miles away from where I worked,\" he said. \"And they just didn't have the equivalent of US$15 to get onto a bus to come to the hospital.\"",
      "At the time, there were only 10 psychiatrists serving 13 million people in Zimbabwe. So, Chibanda came up with an idea involving grandmothers: \"These grandmas were actually, you know, the custodians of the local culture and the wisdom, and they were rooted in their communities. And I was like, what if we could train them to be the first port of call for anyone needing to talk in a community?\"",
      "So, in 2006, Chibanda introduced the \"Friendship Bench,\" a talk therapy program that brings mental healthcare directly into underserved communities. The program is free, and the grandmothers were happy to donate their time.",
      "He chronicled this journey in a new book: \"The Friendship Bench: How Fourteen Grandmothers Inspired a Mental Health Revolution\" (New World Library).",
      "\"When I first started this, in fact we called it the Mental Health Bench,\" he said. \"Interestingly, nobody came to the Mental Health Bench, because of the stigma, until the grandmas said, 'You know, why don't you turn it into a Friendship Bench?'\"",
      "During that first year, 14 volunteer grandmothers shared a Friendship Bench with several hundred visitors in that one suburb. Chibanda says the program has since expanded beyond grandmothers to include over 3,000 older listeners who last year saw more than 300,000 people all over Zimbabwe.",
      "He said, \"There are a lot of people out there who are struggling to just connect with another human being. And this gives them that opportunity, to be able to sit down with someone who is empathic.\"",
      "Globally, just under 300 million people are struggling with depression, according to the World Health Organization. Only about one-third of them receive any treatment. And at a time when we're facing an epidemic of loneliness and isolation affecting 1 in 5 American adults (according to a 2024 Gallup poll), the Friendship Bench is hitting the road, expanding to vulnerable communities in 9 countries and counting, including the United States.",
      "At the Washington Seniors Wellness Center, in our nation's capital, the program is being piloted by the nonprofit organization HelpAge USA, which focuses on the inclusion of older people.",
      "Seventy-four-year-old Arnette Ibitayo says she was struggling with the deaths of her son and brother. \"My son's was sudden; he had a heart attack at 44,\" she said. \"And then my brother had COVID.\"",
      "She turned to the Friendship Bench. \"So I'm, you know, feeling down, depressed,\" she said. \"I think I need to talk to somebody, because I felt like isolating and staying home. And it was very comforting to get it out. And I wasn't judged, and I was able to speak freely, and the person gave me some helpful advice.\"",
      "That person was Theresa Kelly, a retired schoolteacher, who listened to Ibitayo's story. \"We don't solve problems for them,\" Kelly said. \"Sometimes you don't realize that you can be your own problem solver. And when they finish, we want them to leave empowered.\"",
      "A screening process refers more serious cases to professionals. For almost 20 years now, Dr. Chibanda has been using his medical training to help analyze and improve the program. \"The Friendship Bench is actually rooted in a lot of research,\" he said. \"These grandmas were a lot more effective than trained mental health professionals at alleviating symptoms of both depression and generalized anxiety disorders.\"",
      "Arnette Ibitayo said she felt better after just one session with Kelly: \"I was more at ease. It worked. It was working.\"",
      "\"You feel a little less depressed now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, uh-huh. There's hope that things are going to be better.\"",
      "So, what's the special sauce when it comes to grandparents? According to Chibanda, it is \"the natural abilities that come with having a long-lived life on the planet. They've seen a lot.

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 19:25:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is firing thousands of federal workers on probationary status, or those without civil service protections.",
    "story": [
      "Probational federal employees who lost their jobs on Thursday as part of the Trump administration's mass\u00a0firing of government workers\u00a0expressed shock and anger at the terminations, which they contend will hurt the government's ability to provide services.",
      "President Trump is moving quickly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 saying he is slashing wasteful spending and pushing to make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's policies. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "Federal workers who received termination notices on Thursday described receiving nonpersonalized emails informing them they had been removed from their position, with little communication from their supervisors. The workers said they had entered public service because of a commitment to serve the public interest, whether by helping protect consumers from predatory financial services or by supporting veterans.",
      "\"We had all received these notices that cites probationary regulations and says we're being let go because 'you are not fit for continued employment because your ability and skills do not fit the agency's needs,'\" Elizabeth Aniskevich, an attorney with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS News.",
      "A termination letter provided to CBS News by a former employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs informed the worker that his job was ending because \"you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.\"",
      "The VA worker, who had previously held federal jobs across different agencies for more than a decade, said he was dismayed to learn that he was considered a probationary worker after taking the Veterans Affairs job last fall, as it reset his government employment.",
      "\"Basically the gist [of the termination letter] is laying out I was a probationary employee, what my rights of appeal are, but my continued employment was no longer in the public interest,\" said the VA worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his chances of finding another government job. \"I came into the house \u2014 probably for a couple weeks my wife and I joked, 'Did I still have a job?' \u2014 I told her, and I lost it. It's devastating.\"",
      "Another VA employee, who told CBS News his work was rated as \"outstanding\" in his most recent performance review, said receiving an impersonal termination letter was hurtful.",
      "\"It feels like a copy/paste mass firing that takes nothing into account of the people, the human cost,\" said Greg House, 34, a disabled veteran who was terminated from his job at the VA's public affairs office in Salt Lake City, a job that he started in March 2024. He added, \"The idea that the federal workforce is too bloated feels like a scapegoat more than anything else. Nobody joins the federal government to get rich.\"",
      "The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has instructed agencies to report their final numbers of fired probationary employees by 8 p.m Eastern time on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "The White House press office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Unions claim firings are illegal",
      "Five unions for government employees have sued Mr. Trump and other officials in his administration over the firing of probationary workers, alleging the move is illegal because it violates procedures for making \"reductions in force,\" a formal process used by government agencies to dismiss employees.",
      "Reductions in force, or RIFs, can be made based on a number of issues, such as if there's not enough work or funding for federal workers, according to OPM.",
      "Mr. Trump's order \"directs agencies to promptly engage in RIFs for none of the specified, allowable reasons, but instead for the purpose of 'eliminating waste, bloat and insularity,'\" the lawsuit claims, citing the president's Feb. 11 executive order for widespread layoffs of government workers.",
      "Some experts are pushing back on the idea that the government workforce is too large, pointing out that federal employment has grown little since 1980. Prior to the firings, some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration.",
      "Impact on services",
      "The VA employee who was fired Thursday said he took exception to Mr. Trump's claim that the terminations would make the government more efficient, noting that his group, which had been trying to fill several empty positions, had more work than they could handle.",
      "\"We are under-resourced as it is, so cutting jobs won't do it,\" he said, adding that the firings will directly impact veterans. \"We have ongoing projects to try to construct and repair facilities to help veterans \u2014 we're already behind.\"",
      "A Food and Drug Administration employee \u2014 who also requested anonymity because she's in a probationary period in her job but hasn't received a termination letter \u2014 expressed concern that the firings would slow essential work, both because of the loss of skilled employees and a hit to employee morale.",
      "\"We're rather leanly staffed \u2014 the people on some of these teams have a tremendous workload,\" she said. \"It'll slow down things like drugs approvals ... it'll have a tremendous, terrible impact on access to drugs and generic drugs.\"",
      "Because many of the probationary workers are younger employees, the firings could add to long-term problems facing the federal workforce, where twice as many workers are over age 60 than under 30, said Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School.",
      "\"This will exacerbate the existing human capital crisis if probationary employees are more likely to be young, and more likely to have the skills that a 21st century government operation needs,\" she said.",
      "Where jobs are getting cut",
      "As of May 2024, the most recent data available, about 216,000 federal employees had been in their jobs for less than one year, according to government data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "The government agency with the most probationary employees is the VA, with about 56,000 workers bearing that designation, OPM data shows. The VA on Friday said it had fired more than 1,000 employees. The agency didn't respond to a request for comment about whether more firings could be coming.",
      "\"Make no mistake \u2014 Trump is looking to fire probationary employees because it is easy, not because it is good for veterans or cost-effective,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut who serves on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, told CBS News in a statement. \"In fact, it is a massive waste of taxpayer dollars to fire employees the department just invested months into recruiting, vetting and training.\"",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials expect most of the agency's roughly 5,200 probationary employees to be fired Friday, Feb. 14, under the Trump administration's move to get rid of nearly all probationary employees, according to an audio recording of a National Institutes of Health department meeting obtained by the Associated Press.",
      "In that meeting, an NIH office director told employees that some probationary staff with specialized skills might retain their positions. Probationary staff being terminated would receive an email Friday afternoon, the AP reported, citing the recording.",
      "Among those being cut are nearly 1,300 probationary employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or roughly one-tenth of the agency's workforce.",

    "summary": "Federal layoffs are starting with huge numbers of probationary workers, and there are warnings of bigger cuts on the way.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Thursday intensified its sweeping efforts to\u00a0shrink the size of the federal workforce, the nation's largest employer, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who hadn't yet gained civil service protection \u2014 potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "In addition, workers at some agencies were warned that large workplace cuts would be coming.",
      "The decision on probationary workers, who generally have less than a year on the job, came from the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government. The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss it publicly.",
      "Even workers in the personnel office itself weren't immune: Dozens of probationary employees at OPM were told on a Thursday afternoon group call that they were being dismissed and then instructed to leave the building within a half-hour, according to another person who likewise spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It's expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "Elon Musk, to whom the president has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the elimination of whole agencies.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees representing federal workers, said the administration \"abused\" the probation status of workers \"to conduct a politically driven mass firing spree, targeting employees not because of performance, but because they were hired before Trump took office.\"",
      "Thursday's order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren't meeting high standards. It's not clear how many workers are currently in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, as of March 2024, 220,000 workers had less than a year on the job \u2014 the most recent data available.",
      "The firing of probationary employees began earlier this week and has included the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education workers.",
      "At least 39 were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials.",
      "The layoffs also hit Department of Veterans Affairs researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said Thursday.",
      "Murray said in a statement that she heard from VA researchers in her state who were told to stop their research immediately, \"not because their work isn't desperately needed, but because Trump and Elon have decided to fire these researchers on a whim.\"",
      "The VA announced Thursday that it had laid off more than 1,000 non-\"mission critical\" probationary workers and the move would \"save the department more than $98 million per year, and VA will redirect all of those resources back toward health care, benefits and services for VA beneficiaries.\"",
      "Half of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention's Epidemic Intelligence Service officers \u2014 a group known as\u00a0the CDC's \"disease detectives\" \u2014 were among the cuts made Friday, multiple health officials tell CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration also moved Friday to fire more than 400 employees at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a group that defends government workers, said the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service would be hit especially hard by laying off probationary employees because it has trouble recruiting inspectors required to be present at all times at most slaughterhouses.",
      "The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20% of the workers are in Washington D.C. and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the Capitol region.",
      "Layoffs are unlikely to yield significant deficit savings. When the Congressional Budget Office looked at the issue, it found the government spent $271 billion annually compensating civilian federal workers, with about 60% of that total going to workers employed by the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.",
      "The government could, in theory, cut all those workers and still run a deficit of over $1 trillion that would continue to grow as tax revenues are needed to keep up with the growing costs of Social Security and Medicare.",
      "Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said firing employees on probation is flawed because it targets younger workers.",
      "\"Baby Boomers are retiring right and left, so actually the people you want to keep are probably most of the people who are right now on probation,\" said Kamarck, who worked in former President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration when about 426,000 federal jobs were cut over more than eight years in a deliberative effort aimed at reinventing government. \"They're younger and presumably have better skills, and that's who you want.\"",
      "Mr, Trump's initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, commonly described as a \"buyout,: which offered to pay people until Sept. 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program Wednesday.",
      "However, the number of workers who took the offer was less than the administration's target, and Mr. Trump has made it clear he would take further steps.",
      "Employees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.",
      "The order the president signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring will be restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four who leave. In addition, new hires would generally need approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk's team.",
      "Mr. Trump has praised Musk's work to slash federal spending.",
      "The Republican president has also been sharply critical of federal workers, especially those who want to keep working remotely, though his administration is simultaneously working to cut federal office space and ordering the termination of worksite leases throughout the government.",
      "\"Nobody is gonna work from home,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"They are gonna be going out, they're gonna play tennis, they're gonna play golf, they're gonna do a lot of things. They're not working.\"",

      "In letters to the editor published Thursday in The Financial Times and the Los Angeles Times, Anne and Lucy Dayton said their father, Bruce Dayton, along with his four other brothers, expanded the Minneapolis department store into a massive brand that became Target that was built on two principles: a focus on the customer and the well-being of the community.",
      "Bruce Dayton died in 2015 at 97.",
      "\"We are alarmed how quickly the business community has given in to the current administration's retaliatory threats,\" the daughters wrote. \"It is not 'illegal' for a company to create a business model based on what it believes to be important ethical and business standards.\"",
      "They added that, \"By cowering, Target and others are undermining the very principles that have made their companies a success.\"",
      "Target couldn't be immediately reached for comment.",
      "In late January, Target said the changes to its \"Belonging at the Bullseye\" strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.",
      "Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it already had planned to end the racial program this year. The company also said that it would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.",

      "Working with billionaire Elon Musk, Mr. Trump has offered a \"deferred resignation\" plan to more than 2 million federal employees, that would grant pay through the end of September while not working, in exchange for agreeing to step down. A federal judge on Tuesday cleared the program to proceed after it had been paused.",
      "About 75,000 workers have accepted the offer, and the Trump administration said that the deferred resignation program was closed as of 7 p.m. Feb. 12. The offer excludes members of the armed forces, U.S. Postal Service workers, and those who work in jobs related to immigration enforcement and national security.",
      "In another move aimed at remaking the federal workforce, Mr. Trump this week also signed an executive order to reduce the number of government employees and limit hiring.",
      "The administration's order on Thursday to cut probationary workers is expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. According to federal data, there are about 220,000 federal workers with less than a year on the job, representing about 9% of the government workforce.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Is the federal workforce growing?",
      "As Mr. Trump and Musk charge ahead, some policy experts note that the federal workforce has decreased relative to the U.S. population when compared with earlier decades. The upshot: There are fewer government workers providing services to more U.S. residents than in prior years, according to new research from the Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "The federal workforce has waxed and waned over the years, but its size today puts it on the same footing as during the 1980s, when the U.S. population was about 220 million. Today, there are more than 330 million U.S. residents.",
      "How big is the federal workforce?",
      "The U.S. has more than 2.4 million federal workers, excluding those who work for the U.S. Postal Service, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (As a self-funded agency, the USPS relies on sales of stamps and other products and services to support its operations.)",
      "\"In absolute terms, the federal workforce is slightly smaller than it was 50 years ago, even though the U.S. population has increased by two-thirds during that time period,\" noted Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "In the 1940s, the federal workforce represented 4.5% of non-farm workers, a share that's dwindled to 1.5% today, according to CEPR's analysis.",
      "How efficient is the federal workforce?",
      "There's no overarching measure of the efficiency of the federal workforce, Linos of Harvard's Kennedy School noted. But agencies typically review their own operations to identify gaps that affect their ability to provide services.",
      "The federal workforce's efficiency should be measured on whether agencies are delivering the services they've been tasked to handle, she added. In recent years, many agencies have added data-driven measurements to determine whether they are providing those services to Americans.",
      "For instance, the Social Security Administration's most recent annual performance report identified long wait times for callers as a trouble spot, and added that it would like to shave the hold times to 12 minutes on average from its 34 minute on-hold time for fiscal year 2024. But that \"aspirational goal\" was being evaluated amid a hiring freeze, the report added.",
      "The Social Security Administration, which last year served a record 68 million beneficiaries, is working with its smallest staff in 50 years, former Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley said in November congressional testimony.",
      "To be sure, the U.S. government suffers from various types of inefficiencies, with a 2024 U.S. Government Accountability Office\u00a0report\u00a0estimating that as much as $521 billion annually is lost to fraud, or about 8% of federal spending.",
      "Federal spending also has ballooned in recent years, although much of the increase is due to higher spending on Social Security and paying interest on federal debt,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",
      "What agencies have the most federal workers?",
      "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has the most federal workers, with more than 487,000 employees, according to data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, or OPM. That's followed by the Department of Homeland Security, with more than 222,000 workers; and the U.S. Army, with 221,000 employees.",
      "Some of the agencies that have been targeted by Mr. Trump are relatively small by comparison. For instance, the president is considering an executive order to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, which has about 4,200 employees.",
      "Where are federal workers based geographically?",
      "Only about 7% of federal workers are located in Washington, D.C., proper, according to a 2024 Congressional Research Service report. But when adding the federal workers located in Virginia and Maryland, the larger Washington, D.C., metro area represents about 20% of the entire government workforce.",
      "Roughly 80% of federal workers are located outside the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, and civil service employees are employed in every U.S. state, the CRS report noted.",
      "While Washington, D.C., proper has the largest number of federal workers, at about 162,000, other states aren't far behind: California employs about 147,000 federal workers, while Texas has about 130,000.",
      "Additional states with sizable federal workforces include Florida, at about 94,000, and Georgia, with almost 80,000 federal workers, the analysis found.",
      "What does the typical federal worker earn?",
      "The average annual salary of federal workers tops $106,000, Pew Research Center found, citing OPM data.",
      "Federal salaries skew into the six figures because many civil service workers hold college or professional degrees, and are highly trained. The largest share of federal workers are employed in the medical field \u2014 physicians and nurses who work for the VA, for instance.",
      "Others are professionals such as accountants and attorneys who might be able to earn more if they worked for private employers. For instance, the Commodity Future Trading Commission, which regulates futures contracts and other derivatives, pays its employees an average of $235,910. About 40% of its workforce is comprised of attorneys, Pew found.",
      "How could a much smaller federal workforce affect Americans?",
      "Services could degrade if enough federal workers are cut or resign, Harvard's Linos said. But Americans would still expect a certain level of service, such as getting their benefits paid on time or getting a passport on a timely basis.",
      "To address that issue, the federal government could turn to private-sector contractors to pick up the slack, she added. \"That's more costly \u2014 you end up paying a higher wage to private sector workers with less accountability,\" she noted.",
      "A hit to public services could heighten negative public sentiment about the federal government, Linos added. Public trust in the federal government has declined for decades, falling from about 77% of people in the 1960s who trust the government to do what is right to about 22% today, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\"We tell people the government is bloated, the day-to-day experience gets worse, and that feeds the narrative that the government is useless,\" she said.",

    "summary": "America's trading partners keep their markets to closed to U.S. exports, White House says in ordering up plan to impose global tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed a memorandum directing his administration to weigh reciprocal tariffs, threatening to impose levies on U.S. imports from nations that put higher duties on American products.",
      "\"I've decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office at a proclamation signing. \"It's fair to all. No other country can complain.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that its tariff policies would level the competitive playing field for U.S. and foreign manufacturers, although the new taxes would probably be shouldered by U.S. shoppers and businesses either directly or indirectly.",
      "Tariffs, which act as a tax on foreign goods, could lead to higher prices, which are rarely if every welcomed by Americans, and having more import duties on the horizon comes against a backdrop of inflation flaring up once again. Consumer prices in January\u00a0accelerated\u00a0to 3% on an annual basis, signaling the Federal Federal's push to drive inflation down to a 2% annual rate has petered out, at least for now.",
      "Deutsche Bank analysts said in a research note earlier this week that proceeding with reciprocal U.S. tariffs poses \"additional upside risks to the inflation outlook.\"",
      "Trade negotiations",
      "The tariff hikes would vary for affected countries, with a goal of starting new trade negotiations, the Associated Press reported. A senior White House official who spoke to the wire service on condition of anonymity said the reviews required to move forward with the tariffs could be finished within a number of weeks, although the process could take longer.",
      "The plan \"will seek to correct long-standing imbalances in international trade and ensure fairness across the board,\" the White House said in a statement about the tariffs. \"Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security,\" it proclaimed.",
      "The announcement came before a meeting between Mr. Trump and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, a country that could be targeted by U.S. tariffs. Modi has recently sought to assuage the Trump administration's concerns regarding trade issues, moving to cut import India's tariffs on some motorbikes and bourbon whiskey, while also agreeing to receive planes carrying undocumented migrants.",
      "President Trump has placed an additional tariff on Chinese imports for what he says is that nation's role in producing opioid fentanyl. He has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico that could take effect next month, after being paused 30 days. Mr. Trump also this week announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that are scheduled to take effect in March.",
      "Applying a matching tariff against select U.S. trading partners is likely an alternative to imposing a more sweeping levy, according to economists. Argentina, Brazil, India and Turkey have the biggest gaps in tariffs with the U.S., trade data shows.",
      "\"While most developed markets would come out relatively unscathed, emerging markets would suffer a greater loss of competitiveness, with India, Brazil and Turkey looking among the most exposed,\" Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a report. \"It is probable that their governments (among others) would provide concessions to President Trump in an attempt to prevent reciprocal tariffs from being imposed.\"",

      "Indeed, as many as 3 in 4 U.S. homeowners could be underinsured, reports CBS News national consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi. That means more Americans should get to know their insurance policies, said Jennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of the nonprofit After the Fire USA.",
      "\"Well, the first thing you have to do is actually read your policy, and most of us don't do that, and so really encourage you to either sit down with somebody who is an expert in insurance \u2014 your underwriter [the insurance company] will be able to do this with you,\" Thompson told Quraishi.",
      "How much coverage do I need?",
      "Determining how much insurance you have, versus what you need to rebuild your a home in case of a disaster, is relatively straighforward. Start by taking the dollar amount of your policy coverage limit and dividing that by the square footage of your house or apartment.",
      "The resulting figure should equal the average construction cost per square foot in your area \u2014 a dollar amount Quraishi said you can find by doing an online search for \"construction cast per square foot,\" along with your zip code.",
      "For those who discover they have no protection of any kind of natural disaster, or after doing the math find that they're not sufficiently covered, the next step should be to get the maximum amount of coverage they can.",
      "\"Do go to your underwriter and ask,\" Thompson said. \"Max out on your insurance \u2014 it does cost us a little bit more every single month, but it's just incredibly important. Some people won't call because they're afraid of being dropped. Do not do that.\"",
      "Make a list of all your things",

      "The price spike in eggs is largely driven by the bird flu, which continues to hit farms and wipe out flocks. When demand remains steady for a product that isn't easily substituted and supply diminishes, prices tend to rise.",
      "\"If you don't have a bird you don't have an egg,\" Sharon Linsenbardt, founder and owner of Barn Buddies Rescue and Sanctuary in Las Vegas, told CBS News reporter Andres Gutierrez. The millions of egg-laying hens killed by avian influenza can't be replaced easily and quickly, added Linsenhardt, who has limited sales to two dozen eggs a family.",
      "\"High egg prices are due to the avian flu issue, which cuts the supply in the available eggs for sale,\" Columbia Business School professor Yiming Ma told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have less supply, that drives up the prices.\"",
      "Egg supplies are likely to remain constrained as long as bird flu outbreaks continue, according to David Anderson, an agricultural economics professor at Texas A&M University.",
      "Anderson, noting a cultural shift that may be exacerbating the problem, also said he has noticed that Americans are leaning toward more protein-heavy diets, driving demand for eggs.",
      "\"We have this nutritional trend, and as people incorporate more protein in their diets, that increases overall egg demand and sets a higher base for demand,\" he said. \"Then when we get this supply shock, low and behold, we get higher prices.\"",
      "Retailers rationing eggs",
      "Ongoing egg shortages and rising prices recently prompted 24-hour breakfast chain Waffle House to add a 50 cent surcharge per egg, while some major grocery chains are imposing limits on how many eggs shoppers can buy at a time.",
      "Walmart is curtailing purchases of 60-count cartons to two per purchase \"to ensure more customers can have access to eggs,\" a spokesperson for the retailer said.",
      "\"Although supply is very tight, we're working with suppliers to try and help meet customer demand, while striving to keep prices as low as possible,\" the spokesperson added. At Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, the warehouse club is limiting the number of egg purchases to two per item at its nearly 600 stores across the U.S.",
      "As of Wednesday, most of Target's nearly 2,000 U.S. stores had eggs in stock, and the retailer only has purchase limits in place in its Hawaii stores, according to a spokesperson for the retailer. \"We'll continue to monitor and adjust as needed,\" they added.",
      "Kroger, which operates about 2,700 U.S. grocery stores, hasn't imposed a company-wide cap on egg purchases, though some stores are limiting customers to buying two dozen per visit.",
      "Giant Eagle said it was selling conventional shelled eggs \"at or below our cost across all our supermarkets\" to limit the impact of rising egg prices on its customers. The regional grocery, which operates more than 470 stores in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, is encouraging shoppers to limit their purchase to a maximum of three egg cartons per visit.",
      "Amazon-owned Whole Foods and Costco did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "When will egg prices drop?",
      "Egg prices are expected to rise a total of 20% in 2025, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the rising costs, consumer demand remains firm and could even increase as Easter approaches, offering little hope for respite on prices.",
      "Two things have to happen for prices to ease, according to experts. The U.S. must contain the bird flu, and older chickens that are past their productive primes, as well as diseased chickens, have to be replaced. Exactly how long all of this will take is uncertain.",
      "\"it's not clear that we've fully controlled the spread of bird flu. That's the first step, and it'll be a few months after that before you can breed and replace the laying population,\" Bryan Spillane, Bank of America senior food and beverage analyst, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He expects it will be at least another three to six months before prices moderate. If restaurants continue to implement surcharges for eggs, that could eventually put a damper on demand.",
      "In the near-term, Anderson expects eggs to continue hitting consumers' wallets. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see prices continue to go up, because we continue to have outbreaks,\" he said.",
      "Cost-conscious consumers can comparison shop among grocery stores, noted NerdWallet spokesperson Sara Rathner, but be aware that if price differences aren't substantial, you could eat up any cost savings on gas.",
      "Other ways to save on eggs include using store circulars, or buying them with a cash-back credit card. \"Then you're combining multiple ways to reduce your bill,\" she said.",

      "Inflation accelerated in January, rising 3% on an annual basis, indicating that the Federal Reserve's push to drive inflation down to a 2% annual rate has stalled out, at least temporarily.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The Consumer Price Index was forecast to rise 2.9% last month, according to economists polled by financial-data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "On a monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.5%, versus economists' forecast for a 0.3% increase, according to FactSet. That's the biggest monthly jump since August 2023. It may be due to price increases set at the start of the year by many businesses, noted Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant in an email.",

      "What economists say",
      "Recent sticky inflation data backs the Federal Reserve's decision last month to hit the brakes on additional rate cuts, economists say. On Feb. 11, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that the central bank does \"not need to be in a hurry\" to pare rates further.",
      "\"This is not a good number,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said in an email of January's CPI data. \"This is almost starting to look like a re-run of the first half of 2024, when inflation surprised everyone (including the Fed) on the upside.\"",
      "He added, \"And it illustrates how the Fed has not completed the job of getting inflation back down just as new inflation risks - from tariff hikes and a squeeze on labor supply growth - start to emerge.\"",
      "The new data shows that inflation picked up speed at the start of the President Trump's second administration, which has signaled its intention to enact broad-based tariffs, including newly announced 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.",
      "Because tariffs are essentially taxes on imports that are largely passed through to U.S. consumers, Mr. Trump's import duties, if enacted, could push inflation higher in 2025, economists are forecasting.",
      "What it means for your money",
      "Higher borrowing costs for longer: With the Fed pausing on additional rate cuts, consumers are likely to pay more for loans and other debt, ranging from credit cards to auto loans.",
      "\"Today's stronger than expected CPI release is likely to further cement the [Federal Reserve's] cautious approach to easing,\" said Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email. \"We think the Fed is likely to remain in 'wait and see mode' for the time being and anticipate the Fed staying on hold at next month's meeting.\"",
      "Mortgage rates also aren't likely to see relief anytime soon. Despite Fed cuts in 2024, mortgage rates remain near 7%, or close to a 20-year high. Mortgage rates haven't followed the arc of the Fed's rate cuts because they're based on economic data as well as the 10-year Treasury yield.",

    "summary": "Although President Trump can't overturn the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, experts say he can change how it is enforced.",
    "story": [
      "Supporters of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) praise it as an important anti-bribery statute that keeps corporations honest when doing business outside the U.S. By contrast, the law's detractors say it unfairly hobbles American companies, giving an advantage to foreign players.",
      "On Monday, President Trump took a side. \"It sounds good on paper but in practicality, it's a disaster,\" he said while signing an executive order \u00a0freezing enforcement of the 1977 law. \"It's going to mean a lot more business for America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump can't overturn the law, but as head of the executive branch he can change the way it is enforced and shift resources to other Justice Department priorities.",
      "His order puts in place a 180-day \"pause\" to all investigations under the FCPA while they are being reviewed. He also ordered no new ones be opened during that period. The order also says it will halt other Justice Department \"actions\" under the law, which might mean ongoing prosecutions though that is unclear.",
      "President Trump said the pause is also necessary to give his administration time to come up with new \"reasonable\" guidelines on how to enforce the law that don't put U.S. companies at a disadvantage in striking foreign deals.",
      "The consequences could be dramatic, depending on Mr. Trump's next move, experts say.",
      "If he halts many prosecutions, essentially defanging the law, it could help U.S. businesses win deals abroad. However, doing so could also tarnish America's image as a safe place to do business, and also send a green light to corrupt autocrats ruling over impoverished people to get even richer. France, Britain, Japan and other wealthy countries could also in turn weaken their own anti-bribery laws so their companies can make payments, too.",
      "\"We are facing a Wild West situation,\" said Mark Pieth, a criminal law professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland and anti-bribery law expert. \"It will be everyone against everyone.\"",
      "Specifically, Mr. Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Duncan Levin, a criminal defense attorney, said he expects Mr. Trump to essentially kill the law by neglect.",
      "\"He can't get rid of the law, but he can refuse to enforce it,\" said Levin, who has represented high profile defendants Harvey Weinstein and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. \"I don't think this is just a pause.\"",
      "What is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?",
      "The FCPA is a federal law that makes it illegal for U.S. companies and individuals to make payments to foreign government officials \"to secure any improper advantage\" in order to win or retain business. It was enacted in the 1970s to address concerns of global corruption after investigators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found hundreds of American companies making questionable or illegal payments to foreign officials to win business. The law doesn't require that the bribe is actually paid, but only offered.",
      "Over the past nearly 50 years, prosecutions under the law have brought to light a long and varied list of bribes.",
      "Last year, the military contractor RTX, formerly Raytheon, paid more than $300 million to settle charges it had allegedly bribed officials in Qatar by using a sham contract and other devices to hide its tracks.",
      "In 2019, Walmart paid $282 million to settle charges from a seven-year investigation into allegations it won approval to open stores in Mexico, India and Brazil by bribing local officials, including one contact called the \"sorceress\" who had an uncanny ability to make permitting problems disappear.",
      "Who enforces the FCPA?",
      "The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which handles civil enforcement of bribery-related acts, and the Department of Justice, which is responsible for civil and criminal enforcement for the law.",
      "Only criminal cases carry the threat of prison time, according to the National Whistleblower Association, adding that the burden of proof is lower for civil cases. In criminal bribery cases, punishment for conviction is imprisonment of up to 20 years, and companies face fines double their profits from the illicit deal.",
      "Why is the FCPA important?",
      "The FCPA was enacted to protect U.S businesses from global corruption costs as a result of bribery.",
      "By prohibiting companies from unfair advantages through the illegal payment of foreign officials, and by requiring that companies covered by the law to keep accurate records of payment transactions and devise and maintain an adequate internal accounting controls, the FCPA protects U.S. businesses from global corruption costs stemming from bribery and helps ensure fair competition.",
      "Criticisms against the FCPA",
      "President Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Since the FCPA was enacted nearly 50 years ago, U.S. businesses have complained that it was hurting more than helping and unfair because bribes were commonplace in some countries. Then under U.S. pressure, allies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development started enacting their own laws, especially after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and African and Asian countries formerly in the communist orbit opened their borders to business.",
      "Eventually, 40 wealthy countries adopted anti-bribery laws based on the FCPA, according to University of Basel's Pieth, including the ability to prosecute foreign companies operating in their countries for acts committed in a third country.",
      "Therein lies another danger of Mr. Trump weakening the FCPA, according to Pieth.\"If a U.S. company bribes because Trump is giving them the green light, the French and the British will jump on that company,\" he said. \"It will be a mess.\"",

      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",
      "Why was the CFPB created?",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world.

      "\"Congress created this thing, and I don't understand how that's possible for the executive branch to truly get rid of a federal agency that Congress created, whether I like it or not,\" said Michel. \"I don't know what the end game is \u2014 I don't know what they are trying to do,\" the economist and statistician said of the Trump administration's efforts at pulling the plug on the CFPB's work.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 07:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in China for defamation \u2013 and won just about every time. Elon Musk's company has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy there.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang isn't the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk,\u00a0among the richest men in the world\u00a0and a self-described \"free speech absolutist.\" Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review by The Associated Press  of public court documents and Chinese media reports. Tesla won all eleven cases for which the AP could track down the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It isn't common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla's record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Trump's new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Mr. Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others who've traditionally acted as guardrails.",
      "Tesla officials in China and the United States didn't reply to requests for comment.",
      "Tesla's hospitable business dynamics in China",
      "Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told the AP they've been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, the AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\"The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\" said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \"That's why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\"",
      "Customer's tough times",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang's mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad's fault because he hadn't maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\"Tesla's employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\" Zhang said in an interview. \"I was burning with anger.\"",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \"Tesla brake failure\" in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 124 miles from her home. She sat on the Tesla's roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \"Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,\" she said. \"A family of four almost died.\" The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \"Brakes fail\" and headed for Tesla's booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker's officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn't get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \"Tesla brakes fail!\"",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\"Things escalated,\" said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang's protest had been orchestrated \u2014 perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn't acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \"had someone behind her\" and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive's comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company's own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Tesla's numerous alleged issues",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang's crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang's emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she'd been asking for, but they'd published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn't modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she'd hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang's public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world's most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\"I refuse to accept it,\" Zhang told the Associated Press, \"As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\"",
      "Odds stacked against Tesla owners in court",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it's also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People's Court said that judgments are the result of a \"fair trial\" based on \"the objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\"It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,\" the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it's generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\"For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \"The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.\"",
      "Tesla and Bejing's win-win",
      "Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital.",
      "With Li's support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that's generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world's richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla's arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China's auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world's largest EV-battery maker. China's BYD is now the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\"Tesla had a large part to play in that,\" said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk's factory was critical. \"It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later, they're rolling cars off the line,\" he said. \"I don't know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk's enormous influence in China and U.S.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk's overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Mr. Trump's inner circle.",
      "Musk's \"greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\" said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \"He's done a good job of it in China and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\"",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk's proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla hasn't publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \"maybe it is time\" to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla's brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Tesla targets journalists in China",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told the AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\"We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\" a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest's report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a \"sweatshop.\" The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla's ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP couldn't determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla isn't the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\"Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \"Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\"",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 12 inches of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen's fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\"Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\" Chen said in a court statement reviewed by the AP. \"I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\"",
      "Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation \u2014 and to issue an apology.",
      "\"I deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,\" he wrote. \"I hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.\"",
      "A month later, he apologized for his apology, saying the words were not his own.",

    "story": [
      "Starbucks faces a new lawsuit filed by Missouri's attorney general alleging the restaurant chain relies on \"race-and-sex-based hiring practices\" that violate federal and state laws. The complaint\u00a0also claims the coffee chain's hiring policies have led to slower service and higher prices for consumers because it isn't recruiting the most qualified workers.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, claims Starbucks' diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies are \"mere pretext for its actual commitment to unlawful discrimination.\"",
      "The litigation comes just weeks after President Trump signed an executive order\u00a0banning diversity, equity and inclusion\u00a0programs across the U.S. government, while also directing the U.S. attorney general to \"encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"",
      "A number of major retailers and other companies, along with other organizations, have recently rolled back their DEI initiatives amid pushback from conservative activists, including Ford, Google, McDonald's, Meta, Target and Walmart.",
      "In a statement to CBS News responding to Missouri's suit, Starbucks said, \"We disagree with the attorney general, and these allegations are inaccurate. We are deeply committed to creating opportunity for every single one of our partners (employees). Our programs and benefits are open to everyone and lawful.\"",
      "The company added, \"Our hiring practices are inclusive fair and competitive and designed to ensure the strongest candidate for every job every time.\"",
      "Critics of DEI say employers should make their hiring decisions based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other legally protected categories. The Missouri lawsuit echoes those arguments, alleging that Starbucks' hiring practices discriminates against residents of the state.",
      "\"Starbucks' policies harm the many Missourians whom work, or would like to work, at Starbucks, but have been, are being or will be discriminated against as future victims on the basis of their race, sex, or inclusion in other protected groups,\" the complaint alleges.",
      "While Starbucks' prices and wait times have been a focus of consumer complaints in recent years, experts haven't generally blamed hiring practices for the chain's problems. Instead, analysts have pointed to inflation, which has pushed up the prices of ingredients like coffee and milk, as well as Starbucks' vast number of drink customizations, which can slow orders.",
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol has vowed to tackle some of those issues, pledging last year to simplify beverage customizations and saying customers should receive their drinks in four minutes or less.",
      "Niccol, who was hired from Chipotle last year to revitalize the struggling coffee chain, has also said he wants to make Starbucks' locations \"inviting places to linger.\"",
      "As part of that goal, Starbucks reversed its open-door policy last month after almost seven years, now requiring that people make a purchase if they want to hang out in its stores or use restrooms. The company adopted those policies in 2018 after two Black men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks where they had gone for a business meeting.",
      "Negative publicity over the incident, which was caught on video and widely shared over social media, embarrassed the company and led to its now abandoned open-door policy.",

Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",
      "\"Maintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn't scalable or sustainable,\" Google said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.\"",
      "Google did not provide a full list of the cultural events it added prior to last year's change \u2014 and therefore no longer appear by default today.",
      "But social media users and product experts posting to online community boards have pointed to several holidays and cultural observances that they're not seeing anymore. In addition to the first days of Pride Month and Black History Month, that includes the start of Indigenous Peoples Month and Hispanic Heritage Month, as well as Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Verge first reported on some of these omissions last week.",

      "\"I think we're in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system,\" he said on the company's earnings call. \"It's not insignificant, but it's not going to radically change a multibillion dollar U.S. business, and packaging is only a small component of the total cost structure.\"",
      "Coke could also start sourcing aluminum domestically, and raise consumer prices. Quincey noted that Coke already has \"hedging programs\" in place.",
      "\"As the relative prices of different sources of ingredients and imports change, of course we look at mitigation, productivity, efficiency, adjusting where we get our materials from. All of that goes into the equation to constantly manage how this goes through,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump's aim in announcing the tariffs is to protect U.S. manufacturing. \"Our nation requires steel and aluminum to be made in America, not in foreign lands. We need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",
      "Aluminum is generally more recyclable, and less expensive than plastic. Coke has come under fire for its single-use plastic production, and late last year cut its sustainability goals. The beverage giant is now aiming to use 35% to 40% recycled material in packaging by 2035, revised down from an earlier goal of 50%.",

      "\"A lot goes into flower prices \u2014 it's not solely the rise in the price of goods, but more of a function of an entire agricultural system that relies on transportation, logistics, and of course, weather,\" Josh Koebert, a senior researcher at FinanceBuzz, said in an email.",
      "He said prices this year are more in line with inflation, versus last year when there were other factors like \"erratic weather patterns impacting flower production around the world, increased costs associated with shipping and the supply chain post-COVID, and general increased demand for plants and flowers.\"",

    "summary": "The Justice Department's motion to drop charges against Mayor Adams ends a days-long public over the decision to abandon the case.",
    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors in New York have filed a motion to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, bringing to a close a days-long battle that has upended the Justice Department over the decision to abandon the case.",
      "The motion to dismiss the five-count indictment was filed on the court's public docket on Friday and said, \"The Acting Deputy Attorney General has determined, pursuant to an authorization by the Attorney General, that dismissal is necessary and appropriate, and has directed the same, based on the unique facts and circumstances of this case.\"",
      "\"The Acting Deputy Attorney General concluded that dismissal is necessary because of appearances of impropriety and risks of interference with the 2025 elections in New York City,\" the filing said, adding, \"the Acting Deputy Attorney General also concluded that continuing these proceedings would interfere with the defendant's ability to govern in New York City.\"",
      "The judge overseeing the case must approve the motion before the charges are officially dropped.",
      "A senior career attorney from the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, the acting head of the Justice Department's criminal division and, notably, the acting deputy attorney general who is second in charge at the Justice Department jointly signed the motion.",
      "The decision to drop the case against Adams originated at Justice Department headquarters when former Trump attorney and Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a memo instructing prosecutors in Manhattan to abandon the five-count indictment that was filed in September.",
      "In a statement, Justice Department chief of staff Chad Mizelle said of the refusal by several department prosecutors to file for dismissal of Adams' case, \"The fact that those who indicted and prosecuted the case refused to follow a direct command is further proof of the disordered and ulterior motives of the prosecutors. Such individuals have no place at DOJ.\"",
      "Bove, in his directive, cited Adams' \"restricted\" ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies, and the case was to be dropped without prejudice, so the charges could be revived at a later time. He also made accusations that the charges stemmed from political weaponization. The move followed meetings between senior Justice Department officials, Southern District of New York prosecutors and Adams' attorneys about dropping the charges, a source familiar with the discussions confirmed to CBS News.",
      "What followed was an extraordinary internal revolt from Justice Department leadership and federal prosecutors in Manhattan, pushing back on the decision to drop the charges against New York's mayor. The internal disagreements burst into public view on Thursday, when the acting head of the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, Danielle Sassoon, resigned in protest.",
      "In a letter addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi and reviewed by CBS News, Sassoon offered her resignation and said the request to drop Adams' case \"raises serious concerns that render the contemplated dismissal inconsistent with my ability and duty to prosecute federal crimes without fear or favor and to advance good-faith arguments before the courts.\"",
      "Sassoon's letter to the attorney general alleged that during a meeting with Justice Department officials last month, Adams' attorneys \"urged what amounted to a quid pro quo,\" allegedly offering the mayor's cooperation with Trump administration priorities in exchange for the dismissal of the charges. Bove and Adams' legal team both rejected this assertion.",
      "\"It is a breathtaking and dangerous precedent to reward Adams's opportunistic and shifting commitments on immigration and other policy matters with the dismissal of a criminal indictment. Nor will a court likely find that such an improper exchange is consistent with the public interest,\" Sassoon wrote.",
      "In response, Bove wrote a letter back to Sassoon and accused her of insubordination. The acting deputy attorney general said he and Justice Department leadership stood by the decision to drop Adams' case, and Sassoon's refusal to comply interfered with the \"interests of justice.\"",
      "Bove wrote that because of the prosecution against Adams, the mayor \"is unable to communicate directly and candidly with City officials he is responsible for managing, as well as federal agencies trying to protect the public from national security threats and violent crime.\"",
      "He said his directive to drop the charges \"reflected a determination by the Justice Department that these public safety risks greatly outweigh any interest you have identified.\"",
      "The line prosecutors who worked on Adams' case have been placed on paid leave, pending investigations into Sassoon's conduct, Bove's letter revealed.",
      "Following Sassoon's resignation, supervision of the Adams case was transferred from Manhattan to Justice Department headquarters in Washington, D.C., where two additional leadership members \u2014 Kevin Driscoll of the Criminal Division and John Keller, acting head of the public integrity section \u2014 also resigned in protest, sources confirmed to CBS News. .",
      "Three additional senior officials in the public integrity unit in Washington, D.C., also resigned in the aftermath, two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "And on Friday, a line prosecutor in the Southern District of New York stepped down from his position and pushed back against the Trump administration's decision. In a scathing letter to Bove, Hagan Scotten defended Sassoon's work and the work of prosecutors who worked the Adams case, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"Any assistant U.S. attorney would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials in this way,\" he wrote. \"If there is no lawyer within earshot of the President who is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion.\"",
      "\"But it was never going to be me,\" Scotten said.",
      "And in a joint statement late Friday, a group of seven former U.S. attorneys for the Southern District of New York, including former FBI Director James Comey, said they \"commend\" Sassoon \"on her decision to resign.\"",
      "\"Her commitment to integrity and the rule of law reflects the finest traditions of the Southern District United States Attorney's Office and the Department of Justice,\" they wrote. \"The Department's announced intent to investigate Ms. Sassoon and some of the career prosecutors who served alongside her is a stark departure from those traditions, and that should concern everyone committed to the pursuit of justice without fear or favor.\"",
      "Along with Comey, the statement was signed by Robert B. Fiske Jr., John S. Martin Jr., Mary Jo White, David N. Kelley, Geoffrey S. Berman and Audrey Strauss.",
      "Adams made history as the first sitting New York City mayor to be indicted on five counts of corruption back in September. The charges included bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations. He pleaded not guilty, and has stridently asserted his innocence ever since.",
      "He was to stand trial in April, and if convicted could have faced up to 45 years in prison.",
      "Dismissal comes after Adams meetings with Trump",
      "The stunning turn of events comes after Adams had high-profile meetings with President Trump. The two met in Florida while Mr. Trump was still president-elect. After that meeting, Adams said the two had not discussed his legal case at all.",
      "Adams then went on to cancel his plans to attend Martin Luther King, Jr. Day celebrations in New York City and instead attend Mr. Trump's inauguration, after receiving a last-minute invitation.",
      "When he was previously asked about the case against Adams, Mr. Trump said he thought Adams \"was treated pretty unfairly,\" and said he would consider a pardon. The dismissal of the case negates the need for any pardon.",
      "On Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was not involved with the decision to drop the case, telling members of the press, \"I didn't. I know nothing about it. I did not.\"",
      "Prosecutors recently appeared to be ramping up their case",
      "In her resignation letter, Sassoon, Manhattan's former top prosecutor, revealed her office had considered bringing additional charges against Adams focused on the alleged destruction of evidence and providing false statements to the FBI. Those charges were never filed.",
      "Early in January, prosecutors wrote in court documents that they had uncovered \"additional criminal conduct\" by the mayor. They didn't disclose what that other alleged criminal conduct was, however.",
      "At the time, Adams blasted the disclosure.",
      "\"You know, even Ray Charles can see what's going on. And I have an attorney, Alex Spiro, he is handling that. I've said over and over again, I've done nothing wrong,\" Adams said.",
      "Spiro called the move by prosecutors \"amateur hour,\" and accused them of \"looking for a headline instead of doing the right thing.\"",
      "Shortly after the initial charges against Adams were announced last fall, prosecutors said additional charges were \"quite likely.\"",
      "What's next for Adams",
      "The dismissal of the charges means Adams can fully focus his attention on running the city, as well as run for reelection.",
      "He faces challenges from Comptroller Brad Lander and Lander's predecessor, former Comptroller Scott Stringer, as well as State Sen. Jessica Ramos, State Sen. Zellnor Myrie and Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani \u2014 to name just a few.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had paused bringing in recruits who have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and paused all gender-affirming care, according to a memo issued Feb. 7.",
      "The memo appears in the docket for the case in the D.C. District Court challenging the president's executive order, which could lead to a renewed ban on transgender troops.

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 21:19:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Adams is at the center of a controversy over a directive by the Justice Department to drop corruption charges against him.",
    "story": [
      "Amid a swirl of resignations, charges and calls for New York City Mayor Eric Adams to step down, one person who remains in the mayor's corner is his predecessor.",
      "Bill de Blasio, the former New York City mayor and a fellow Democrat, believes the case against Adams should never have been brought. The charges, which include bribery and campaign finance allegations, \"were flimsy,\" de Blasio said in an interview Friday with CBS News.",
      "\"From Day One, I thought the charges against him were very weak,\" de Blasio said. \"I believe in my heart, and this is from personal experience, that we've got to have maturity to know that just because some prosecutor brings a charge doesn't mean it's true.\"",
      "On Monday, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a memo instructing former New York U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon's office to abandon the five-count indictment against Adams. Bove wrote that the case \"restricted\" Adams' ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies.",
      "Sassoon, who was Manhattan's top career federal prosecutor until Thursday, was among at least half a dozen Justice Department officials to resign after her office was directed to drop its criminal case against Adams.",
      "Adams, who pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing, was set to go to trial in April. Prosecutors said in a sprawling September indictment that Adams abused his power for years, using his influence to obtain illegal campaign contributions and free or discounted travel.",
      "Sassoon wrote in a letter to the attorney general Thursday that Adams' attorneys had \"urged what amounted to a quid pro quo,\" allegedly offering the mayor's cooperation with Trump administration priorities in immigration enforcement in exchange for dismissal of the charges.",
      "An attorney for Adams called that \"a total lie,\" and in a statement Friday, Adams also denied the allegation.",
      "\"I want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered \u2014 nor did anyone offer on my behalf \u2014 any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never,\" Adams said.",
      "Adams on Thursday announced an executive order allowing federal immigration agents to enter the city's Rikers Island jail complex \u2014 a major reversal of city policy. But de Blasio said he is skeptical that decisions like that are evidence of a deal with the White House.",
      "De Blasio said he didn't believe that was indicative of a quid pro quo arrangement. He called the move \"consistent with his previous positions that had nothing to do with his legal case.\"",
      "\"I've had my differences with Eric Adams, but I've known him a long time. He was a police officer for 20 years. He understands the law,\" de Blasio said. \"I am not surprised that he takes a different position on immigration than the rest of us (New York Democrats).\"",
      "De Blasio was broadly critical of the case and the prosecutors who brought it, saying the plan to go to trial just two months before the city's crucial Democratic primary was irresponsible.",
      "However, Sassoon, in her resignation letter Thursday, noted that the Justice Department had indicted Adams earlier. \"The Department of Justice correctly concluded that bringing charges nine months before a primary election was entirely appropriate,\" Sassoon wrote.",
      "De Blasio said he knows from experience the toll of being under investigation. He weathered his own federal probe related to campaign fundraising. It did not lead to charges. De Blasio said \"the process of defending yourself from a potential charge is time consuming\" and often means extra hours spent fundraising.",
      "He said an upcoming election was the elephant in the room.",
      "\"They were explicit that there was a clock in mind. They either had to prove their case or pull it,\" de Blasio said.",
      "In March 2017, acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim announced no charges would be brought against de Blasio. The announcement noted that Kim's office wanted to avoid influencing that year's race for City Hall.",
      "\"Although it is rare that we issue a public statement about the status of an investigation, we believe it appropriate in this case at this time, in order not to unduly influence the upcoming campaign and Mayoral election,\" Kim said.",
      "Adams and Bove called the case against him politically motivated, echoing complaints made about other cases by Bove's former defense client, President Trump.",
      "De Blasio thinks the parallel ends there.",
      "\"It's apples to oranges. For all things related to Trump, there was massive evidence in public view. No one's ever shown evidence of bribery (against Adams),\" de Blasio said.",
      "Mr. Trump was convicted in New York last year of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. He is appealing that conviction. A criminal case in Georgia is on indefinite hold, and a federal case against Mr. Trump was dropped after he was elected in November, because pursuing it further would have violated Justice Department policy regarding sitting presidents. Another federal case was dismissed last summer.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied all allegations and accused various prosecutors of charging him for political gain.",
      "Adams' critics have accused him of cozying up to Trump in order to make his case go away. De Blasio said Adams can show that's untrue through open opposition to Trump policies.",
      "\"The mayor has an opportunity to prove that notion false. He can put this to rest with his actions,\" de Blasio said.",

      "Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a high-stakes meeting at this year's Munich Security conference to discuss the Trump administration's efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Vance said the U.S. seeks a \"durable\" peace, while Zelenskyy expressed the desire for extensive discussions to prepare for any end to the conflict.",
      "\"We want the killing to stop, but we want to achieve a durable, lasting peace,\" Vance said. \"Not the kind of peace that's going to have Eastern Europe in conflict just a couple years down the road.\"",
      "Zelenskyy thanked Vance for the meeting, but stressed the need to address guarantees of Ukraine's security in negotiating an end to the conflict, which is about to enter its fourth year.",
      "\"Really, what we need is to speak more, to work more and to prepare the plan of how to stop Putin and finish the war,\" Zelensky said. \"We want this very much, but we need real security guarantees.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg, and deputy special envoy for the Middle East Morgan Ortagus were at the table with Vance.",
      "President Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy Wednesday and directed his national security team to begin work on negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv Wednesday, the first top Trump administration official to meet in person with the Ukrainian president since the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "After that meeting, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would prepare an agreement to strengthen Ukraine's security and economic relations with the U.S., related to the country's rare earth minerals.",
      "Mr. Trump indicated before the Munich meeting that aid to Ukraine could be conditioned on access to rare earth minerals in the country.",
      "\"We are going to have all this money in there, and I say I want it back. And I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion worth of rare earth,\" the president recently told Fox News. \"They have essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don't feel stupid.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Friday that the U.S. should arm Ukraine with \"a bunch\" of F-16 fighter jets in exchange for the minerals.",
      "\"How do you deter Putin? You arm this guy to the teeth,\" Graham said in Munich while appearing alongside several of his Senate colleagues and Zelenskyy on a panel. \"So let's arm this guy. Let's do the minerals agreement, so we'll have our American business interest. Putin doesn't understand what's going on. If we sign this minerals agreement, Putin is screwed, because Trump will defend the deal.\"",
      "Graham also said NATO membership for Ukraine should stay on the table as a threat to Putin.",
      "\"If we can't agree they should be in NATO like right now, can we agree that if there's ever another invasion, the moment they invade, they'd go into NATO,\" Graham said. \"I think we'll let Putin know that if he ever does this again, they're going into NATO really quick.\"",
      "At last year's gathering in Munich, Vance, then a U.S. senator, declined to meet with Zelenskyy, telling\u00a0Politico\u00a0at the time that he didn't think he \"would learn anything new.\"",
      "The vice president also met Friday with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and British foreign secretary David Lammy.",
      "A negotiated settlement to end the war in Ukraine was a central focus of Vance's discussions with world leaders at the conference this week, sources told CBS News.",
      "Vance did not respond to questions from reporters when asked if Ukraine should be able to join NATO.",
      "Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday that he was \"OK\" with taking the idea of Ukraine joining NATO off the negotiating table, characterizing the proposal as \"not practical.\"",
      "In remarks at the conference, Vance reiterated that Mr. Trump would like to see European allies in NATO contribute at least 5% of their gross domestic product to increased security spending, and he also made that point in meetings with European leaders.",
      "\"While the Trump administration is very concerned with European security, and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine, we also believe that it's important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance lectured Europeans at the conference, telling them, \"The threat that I worry the most about vis-\u00e0-vis Europe is not Russia; it's not China.\"",
      "\"What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America,\" the vice president said.",
      "And he proceeded to condemn enforcement actions taken by European allies against their citizens, noting the conviction for incitement in Sweden of a man who burned a Quran, raids in Germany of people suspected of posting misogynistic hate speech online, and a case in Britain involving the\u00a0conviction\u00a0of a man accused of breaching the safe zone near an abortion clinic in order to pray.",
      "\"I believe deeply that there is not security if you're afraid of the voices and opinions that guide your people,\" Vance said, adding, \"if you're running in fear from your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you.\"",

Cell signal is blocked within a mile-and-a-half radius surrounding the prison to keep any information from getting out in an effort to contain the power of gangs which authorities said used to control 85% or the country's territory. Today, El Salvador has the lowest homicide rate in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Starting in 2022, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador declared a state of exception, which empowered police and the military to arrest people on suspicion of gang affiliation, without any evidence of committing crimes. The state of exception has led to the imprisonment of more than 80,000 people, making El Salvador the country with the highest incarceration rate in the world, at 2%. But the crackdown has earned Bukele an approval rating of more than 90%.",
      "Many inmates are serving sentences that are centuries long, while others still have not been convicted. But the prison's director affirms no prisoner there will ever step outside.",
      "Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that Bukele had agreed to accept deportees from the U.S., including U.S. citizens. Those convicted of crimes would be held in prisons like CECOT.",

They sleep on metal slabs and are only allowed outside the cells for 30 minutes per day. If they need medical attention, they are treated within the modules so no prisoner ever leaves the premises alive.",

    "story": [
      "Probational federal employees who lost their jobs on Thursday as part of the Trump administration's mass\u00a0firing of government workers\u00a0expressed shock and anger at the terminations, which they contend will hurt the government's ability to provide services.",
      "President Trump is moving quickly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 saying he is slashing wasteful spending and pushing to make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's policies. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "Federal workers who received termination notices on Thursday described receiving nonpersonalized emails informing them they had been removed from their position, with little communication from their supervisors. The workers said they had entered public service because of a commitment to serve the public interest, whether by helping protect consumers from predatory financial services or by supporting veterans.",
      "\"We had all received these notices that cites probationary regulations and says we're being let go because 'you are not fit for continued employment because your ability and skills do not fit the agency's needs,'\" Elizabeth Aniskevich, an attorney with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS News.",
      "A termination letter provided to CBS News by a former employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs informed the worker that his job was ending because \"you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.\"",
      "The VA worker, who had previously held federal jobs across different agencies for more than a decade, said he was dismayed to learn that he was considered a probationary worker after taking the Veterans Affairs job last fall, as it reset his government employment.",
      "\"Basically the gist [of the termination letter] is laying out I was a probationary employee, what my rights of appeal are, but my continued employment was no longer in the public interest,\" said the VA worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his chances of finding another government job. \"I came into the house \u2014 probably for a couple weeks my wife and I joked, 'Did I still have a job?' \u2014 I told her, and I lost it. It's devastating.\"",
      "Another VA employee, who told CBS News his work was rated as \"outstanding\" in his most recent performance review, said receiving an impersonal termination letter was hurtful.",
      "\"It feels like a copy/paste mass firing that takes nothing into account of the people, the human cost,\" said Greg House, 34, a disabled veteran who was terminated from his job at the VA's public affairs office in Salt Lake City, a job that he started in March 2024. He added, \"The idea that the federal workforce is too bloated feels like a scapegoat more than anything else. Nobody joins the federal government to get rich.\"",
      "The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has instructed agencies to report their final numbers of fired probationary employees by 8 p.m Eastern time on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "The White House press office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Unions claim firings are illegal",
      "Five unions for government employees have sued Mr. Trump and other officials in his administration over the firing of probationary workers, alleging the move is illegal because it violates procedures for making \"reductions in force,\" a formal process used by government agencies to dismiss employees.",
      "Reductions in force, or RIFs, can be made based on a number of issues, such as if there's not enough work or funding for federal workers, according to OPM.",
      "Mr. Trump's order \"directs agencies to promptly engage in RIFs for none of the specified, allowable reasons, but instead for the purpose of 'eliminating waste, bloat and insularity,'\" the lawsuit claims, citing the president's Feb. 11 executive order for widespread layoffs of government workers.",
      "Some experts are pushing back on the idea that the government workforce is too large, pointing out that federal employment has grown little since 1980. Prior to the firings, some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration.",
      "Impact on services",
      "The VA employee who was fired Thursday said he took exception to Mr. Trump's claim that the terminations would make the government more efficient, noting that his group, which had been trying to fill several empty positions, had more work than they could handle.",
      "\"We are under-resourced as it is, so cutting jobs won't do it,\" he said, adding that the firings will directly impact veterans. \"We have ongoing projects to try to construct and repair facilities to help veterans \u2014 we're already behind.\"",
      "A Food and Drug Administration employee \u2014 who also requested anonymity because she's in a probationary period in her job but hasn't received a termination letter \u2014 expressed concern that the firings would slow essential work, both because of the loss of skilled employees and a hit to employee morale.",

      "Because many of the probationary workers are younger employees, the firings could add to long-term problems facing the federal workforce, where twice as many workers are over age 60 than under 30, said Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School.",

    "summary": "Federal layoffs are starting with huge numbers of probationary workers, and there are warnings of bigger cuts on the way.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Thursday intensified its sweeping efforts to\u00a0shrink the size of the federal workforce, the nation's largest employer, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who hadn't yet gained civil service protection \u2014 potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "In addition, workers at some agencies were warned that large workplace cuts would be coming.",
      "The decision on probationary workers, who generally have less than a year on the job, came from the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government. The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss it publicly.",
      "Even workers in the personnel office itself weren't immune: Dozens of probationary employees at OPM were told on a Thursday afternoon group call that they were being dismissed and then instructed to leave the building within a half-hour, according to another person who likewise spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It's expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "Elon Musk, to whom the president has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the elimination of whole agencies.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees representing federal workers, said the administration \"abused\" the probation status of workers \"to conduct a politically driven mass firing spree, targeting employees not because of performance, but because they were hired before Trump took office.\"",
      "Thursday's order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren't meeting high standards. It's not clear how many workers are currently in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, as of March 2024, 220,000 workers had less than a year on the job \u2014 the most recent data available.",
      "The firing of probationary employees began earlier this week and has included the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education workers.",
      "At least 39 were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials.",
      "The layoffs also hit Department of Veterans Affairs researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said Thursday.",
      "Murray said in a statement that she heard from VA researchers in her state who were told to stop their research immediately, \"not because their work isn't desperately needed, but because Trump and Elon have decided to fire these researchers on a whim.\"",
      "The VA announced Thursday that it had laid off more than 1,000 non-\"mission critical\" probationary workers and the move would \"save the department more than $98 million per year, and VA will redirect all of those resources back toward health care, benefits and services for VA beneficiaries.\"",
      "Half of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention's Epidemic Intelligence Service officers \u2014 a group known as\u00a0the CDC's \"disease detectives\" \u2014 were among the cuts made Friday, multiple health officials tell CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration also moved Friday to fire more than 400 employees at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a group that defends government workers, said the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service would be hit especially hard by laying off probationary employees because it has trouble recruiting inspectors required to be present at all times at most slaughterhouses.",
      "The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20% of the workers are in Washington D.C. and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the Capitol region.",
      "Layoffs are unlikely to yield significant deficit savings. When the Congressional Budget Office looked at the issue, it found the government spent $271 billion annually compensating civilian federal workers, with about 60% of that total going to workers employed by the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.",
      "The government could, in theory, cut all those workers and still run a deficit of over $1 trillion that would continue to grow as tax revenues are needed to keep up with the growing costs of Social Security and Medicare.",
      "Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said firing employees on probation is flawed because it targets younger workers.",
      "\"Baby Boomers are retiring right and left, so actually the people you want to keep are probably most of the people who are right now on probation,\" said Kamarck, who worked in former President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration when about 426,000 federal jobs were cut over more than eight years in a deliberative effort aimed at reinventing government. \"They're younger and presumably have better skills, and that's who you want.\"",
      "Mr, Trump's initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, commonly described as a \"buyout,: which offered to pay people until Sept. 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program Wednesday.",
      "However, the number of workers who took the offer was less than the administration's target, and Mr. Trump has made it clear he would take further steps.",
      "Employees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.",
      "The order the president signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring will be restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four who leave. In addition, new hires would generally need approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk's team.",
      "Mr. Trump has praised Musk's work to slash federal spending.",
      "The Republican president has also been sharply critical of federal workers, especially those who want to keep working remotely, though his administration is simultaneously working to cut federal office space and ordering the termination of worksite leases throughout the government.",
      "\"Nobody is gonna work from home,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"They are gonna be going out, they're gonna play tennis, they're gonna play golf, they're gonna do a lot of things. They're not working.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday moved to fire more than 400 employees at the Department of Homeland Security, the latest effort in a government-wide campaign to dramatically reduce the federal workforce.",
      "Officials at DHS said they had fired hundreds of employees across several of its agencies after supervisors identified \"non-mission critical personnel in probationary status\" within the nation's top cybersecurity agency, known as CISA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers the nation's legal immigration system, among others.",
      "\"Under President Trump's leadership, we are making sweeping cuts and reform across the federal government to eliminate egregious waste and incompetence that has been happening for decades at the expense of the American taxpayer,\" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "McLaughlin said the personnel cuts will result in roughly $50 million in savings, and be \"incalculably valuable\" to the administration's efforts to cut red tape, adding that the department is \"actively identifying other wasteful positions and offices that do not do not fulfill DHS' mission.\"",
      "In total, over 200 personnel have been fired from FEMA, the nation's disaster relief agency. The eliminations follow DHS' announcement earlier this week that four FEMA employees would be terminated over payments to reimburse New York City for hotel costs for migrants. The workers were accused of circumventing agency leadership to make the transactions, which have been part of a routine reimbursement program that offsets costs to care for a spike in migration along the southern border.",
      "The mass firings also include over 130 cuts within the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Among the newest federal agencies, CISA was established during the first Trump administration in 2018 to spearhead a national effort to oversee cyber and physical risk to U.S. critical infrastructure. Among other duties, the top cyber agency partners with states and local jurisdictions to secure U.S. election infrastructure.",
      "The department has also offered a dozen members of the U.S. Coast Guard currently placed on administrative leave a new assignment at the southwest border in support of border security efforts. Those service members previously worked on a team dedicated to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts within the Coast Guard workforce.",
      "The cuts include nearly 50 workers at USCIS, which processes a broad class of applications for immigration benefits, including requests for citizenship, green cards, asylum and work permits, plus an additional ten employees from DHS' Science and Technology Directorate.",
      "Notably, two large DHS agencies spearheading President Trump's highly-publicized crackdown on illegal immigration, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, were spared in Friday's firings.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order Tuesday informing agency leaders to plan for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "Office of Personnel Management officials convened a meeting with agency leaders across government Thursday, instructing them to begin terminating employees still in their probationary period, according to administration officials. Federal employees typically remain on probation between one to two years after being hired, a status that offers some workplace protections but also makes them easier to remove from their posts.",
      "The Trump administration has moved aggressively to fire federal employees, most of them recent hires, in different agencies, including at the departments of Veterans Affairs and Education and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "It has also overseen a sweeping employee purge at the U.S. Agency for International Development, which distributes the foreign aid the Trump administration has sought to pause.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Seattle put a pause on President Trump's directive that seeks to restrict access to gender-affirming care for young people under the age of 19, becoming the second in so many days to halt the president's efforts to target access to the treatments.",
      "The order from U.S. District Judge Lauren King was issued Friday as part of a legal challenge brought one week ago by a group of three states \u2014 Washington, Minnesota and Oregon \u2014 and three physicians who provide the care for transgender patients being treated for gender dysphoria.",
      "King, appointed by former President Joe Biden, held a hearing earlier Friday on the states' bid to temporarily bar enforcement of Mr. Trump's order limiting access to gender-affirming care for young people. A brief entry on the court's docket indicated that King had agreed to grant a temporary restraining order and would issue a written order.",
      "The block will remain in place while legal proceedings move forward.",
      "King's decision follows a similar move by a federal judge in Maryland, who on Thursday\u00a0temporary halted Mr. Trump's executive action for 14 days. His order came in a case brought by the ACLU on behalf of a group of seven transgender youth and two LGBTQ rights organizations.",
      "The president's directive, issued in his first week in office, threatens research and education grants awarded to medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to patients under the age of 19. Treatments covered by the order include puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures.",
      "The Democrat-led states that sued the Trump administration over the order said it deprives transgender youth of life-saving medical care. They called it a \"cruel and baseless broadside against transgender youth, their families, and the doctors and medical institutions that provide them this critical care.\"",
      "\"It is an official statement of bigotry from the president that directs agencies to openly discriminate against vulnerable youth on the basis of their transgender status and sex,\" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. \"It is also a blatant abuse of power. The order usurps spending and legislative powers belonging exclusively to Congress, and seizes the States' historic police powers to regulate the practice of medicine in violation of the Tenth Amendment.\"",
      "But the White House has defended the order as part of an effort to protect children from treatments that can have negative health consequences and that lack evidence as to their efficacy. Justice Department lawyers wrote in a court filing that the suit is also premature, as federal agencies have not threatened to revoke any particular grants at issue in the executive order.",
      "Additionally, the Justice Department said Article II of the Constitution gives the president the authority to direct agencies to take steps to further his administration's policies.",
      "\"That sort of order \u2014 cutting off at the jump the ability of the Executive Branch to even pursue a general course of action \u2014 would be a remarkable intrusion on a separate branch of government, in conflict with Article II,\" they argued in the filing. \"The president has the constitutional authority to direct his subordinates to pursue a general policy goal, consistent with all applicable law.\"",
      "Half of the states have enacted laws in recent years that limit access to gender-affirming care for minors. The Supreme Court is currently considering the constitutionality of one of those laws, from Tennessee, and will likely issue a decision in the challenge brought by former President Joe Biden's administration, three families and a doctor by the beginning of July.",

    "story": [
      "The White House is barring all Associated Press journalists from accessing spaces such as the Oval Office and Air Force One, a top White House official announced Friday, after the White House shut the AP out of the Oval Office and a formal news conference earlier in the week.",
      "The decision to limit AP's access stems from its decision not to recognize the Trump administration's name change from Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America on federal maps, websites and documents. Instead, the White House says it will open AP's spot in the White House press pool to other reporters.",
      "\"The Associated Press continues to ignore the lawful geographic name change of the Gulf of America,\" wrote White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich. \"This decision is not just divisive, but it also exposes the Associated Press' commitment to misinformation. While their right to irresponsible and dishonest reporting is protected by the First Amendment, it does not ensure their privilege of unfettered access to limited spaces, like the Oval Office and Air Force One. Going forward, that space will now be opened up to the many thousands of reporters who have been barred from covering these intimate areas of the administration. Associated Press journalists and photographers will retain their credentials to the White House complex.\"",
      "The AP is a regular representative in the White House press pool, the rotating group of reporters, videographers and photographers who cover the president daily and travel with him whenever he leaves White House grounds. The AP is a news wire service that covers the globe, and local newspapers have increasingly relied on it and other syndicated news outlets as local newsrooms undergone staffing reductions. The AP estimates 4 billion people read its news every day, and it has journalists in nearly 100 countries.",
      "The AP style guide, which many newsrooms across the country follow, published an update on Jan. 23, two days after the president signed his executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico. It noted that Mr. Trump's order only carries authority within the U.S. and other countries did not have to recognize the change. The wire service's guide said that as an international agency, \"the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.\"",
      "In his executive order, Mr. Trump had also reverted the name of Alaska's Mt. Denali back to Mount McKinley. AP said it would refer to it as Mount McKinley because it \"lies solely in the United States,\" adding that \"as president, Trump has the authority to change federal geographical names within the country.\"",
      "The White House Correspondents Association, which represents hundreds of reporters who cover the White House, criticized the White House after it barred AP reporters from a news conference with President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.",
      "\"The White House's decision to bar Associated press reporters from today's press conference with President Trump and Prime Minister Modi is outrageous and a deeply disappointing escalation of an already unacceptable situation,\" the WHCA said. \"Let me be clear: the White House is seeking to curtail press freedoms enshrined in our Constitution, and has publicly admitted they are restricting access to events to punish a news outlet for not advancing the government's preferred language.\"",
      "The WHCA also said the White House's decision constituted a \"textbook violation of not only the First Amendment, but the president's own executive order on freedom of speech and ending federal censorship.\"",
      "After AP's ban from the Trump-Modi news conference, AP executive editor Julie Pace also called the White House's decision a \"plain violation of the First Amendment,\" and she urged the Trump administration \"in the strongest terms possible to stop this practice.\"",

      "On CBS News 24/7 Friday, Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said widespread firings at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ordered by the Trump administration, could hamper progress on health issues for years to come.",
      "\"Over 1,200 (new hires) are expected to be fired,\" she said. \"...That's a huge proportion of the CDC workforce.\"",
      "Beyond that, she said, \"Another group that is being targeted here are senior scientists. These are some of the top of the top talent, and then also the very youngest, the pipeline of new talent. And so this is very concerning when you have your top talent, your new talent, being fired in one big purge.\"",
      "How CDC cuts could affect Americans and their health",
      "These firings come as the nation is currently dealing with a deadly second surge of the flu this season, measles outbreaks in parts of the country, and mounting worries about bird flu.",
      "\"We're going to see a couple things. One, it's a chilling of the Public Health Service. So people will be afraid to do the work that they need to do in terms of informing the public, in terms of warning the public,\" Gounder said. \"We've also seen in some states like Louisiana pulling back on mass vaccinations. I think we'll continue to see moves like that, and that policy may not be guided by science, but rather by politics and ideology.\"",
      "Already, vaccine skepticism in the country is threatening public health. Health experts have seen these views on vaccines, which have become increasingly politicized, contributing to lower vaccination rates across the country, leading to outbreaks of otherwise\u00a0preventable diseases",
      "Kennedy has a\u00a0long history\u00a0of\u00a0raising doubts\u00a0about\u00a0vaccines\u00a0\u2014 despite decades of evidence showing they've saved millions of people from debilitating illness or death.",
      "What does RFK Jr. actually control?",
      "With his confirmation, Kennedy sits at the helm of the sprawling HHS department, which includes the CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 but, despite his passion for changing the way Americans eat, he doesn't have much direct control over that.",
      "\"HHS does not have a ton of levers in terms of improving and making the food supply more healthy,\" Gounder said, since that's largely the role of the United States Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "\"In fact, during the Senate confirmation hearings, one of the senators kind of took him to task on this and essentially told him, you're going to need to stay in your lane and acknowledge that this is not under your purview, that some of these issues are under the purview of USDA and EPA when it comes to tackling chemicals in the environment,\" she added. \"And so, whether he can deliver on his promises, I am very skeptical.\"",
      "One concrete thing he could help move forward is preliminary guidance at the FDA on front-of-package food labeling, Gounder said.",
      "\"(These labels) would make it very clear to consumers whether something's healthy, but whether that rule will be finalized under this administration remains very unclear,\" she said.",
      "Gounder pointed out the MAHA movement is also not focusing on a large chunk of what harms children in the U.S.",
      "\"It's great to say we want our children to be healthy. What are the number one and number two causes of death among kids in this country? It's gun violence and it's motor vehicle accidents,\" she said. \"There's nothing about that in the MAHA executive order that was signed by President Trump.\"",

      "A Texas judge on Thursday ordered a New York doctor to pay more than $100,000 in penalties for prescribing abortion pills to a woman near Dallas, a ruling that could test \"shield laws\" in Democratic-controlled states where abortion is legal.",
      "The ruling was handed down on the same day New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected a request from Louisiana to extradite the same physician, Dr. Maggie Carpenter, who was charged in that state with prescribing abortion pills to a pregnant minor.",
      "Unlike Louisiana, Texas didn't file criminal charges against Carpenter but accused her in a December lawsuit of violating state law by prescribing abortion medication via telemedicine. Texas has one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the nation.",
      "State District Judge Bryan Gantt issued the fine against Carpenter and ordered her to pay attorney's fees. He also issued an injunction barring Carpenter from prescribing abortion medication to Texas residents. Gantt noted in his order that despite being notified, Carpenter failed to appear in court.",

      "Carpenter is co-medical director and founder of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine. Julie Kay, the group's executive director, said the Texas ruling doesn't change shield laws and that \"patients can access medication abortion from licensed providers no matter where they live.\"",

    "summary": "Organizations that receive funding from USAID and other agencies sued after they were cut off from federal funding for foreign assistance programs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to reinstate funding for foreign aid contracts and other awards while litigation moves forward, delivering yet another setback for the president as he seeks to make sweeping changes to the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali partially granted a request for a temporary restraining order from a group of organizations that receive funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, and other agencies, but have since been cut off from federal dollars or had to suspend their work in the wake of Mr. Trump's executive action ordering a 90-day pause on foreign development aid.",
      "The nonprofit organizations argued that Mr. Trump's directive and a subsequent memorandum from Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued late last month, which temporarily stopped new obligations of funding for foreign assistance programs and called for stop-work orders, was an unlawful and unconstitutional exercise of executive power.",
      "They warned that the directive has \"created chaos in the funding and administration\" of USAID and other foreign assistance programs.",
      "\"One cannot overstate the impact of that unlawful course of conduct: on businesses large and small forced to shut down their programs and let employees go; on hungry children across the globe who will go without; on populations around the world facing deadly disease; and on our constitutional order,\" lawyers for one group of challengers, led by the Global Health Council, wrote in a court filing.",
      "Ali, appointed by former President Joe Biden, blocked top Trump administration officials from enforcing a pause on foreign assistance funded through the State Department or USAID without authorization and halting new obligations of funding for foreign assistance programs pending a review. He also barred the administration from suspending contracts, grants or other foreign assistance awards that were in effect as of Jan. 19 and issuing stop-work orders in connection with foreign aid awards that were in existence before Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",
      "The judge said at the current stage of litigation, the nonprofit organizations met their burden for temporary, emergency relief, but that their request was too broad. But Ali found the groups were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and made a \"strong preliminary showing that they were likely to suffer irreparable harm.\"",
      "\"Here, the stated purpose in implementing the suspension of all foreign aid is to provide the opportunity to review programs for their efficiency and consistency with priorities,\" Ali wrote. \"However, at least to date, Defendants have not offered any explanation for why a blanket suspension of all congressionally appropriated foreign aid, which set off a shockwave and upended reliance interests for thousands of agreements with businesses, nonprofits, and organizations around the country, was a rational precursor to reviewing programs.\"",
      "In a hearing held Wednesday, Stephen Wirth, a lawyer representing one group of seven nonprofits, said his clients have been \"devastated\" by Mr. Trump's executive order. He warned that as a result of the freeze on funding for foreign assistance programs, small businesses have been forced to shutter, food for starving populations abroad is rotting in ports and warehouses, and medical supplies are expiring.",
      "Additionally, at least one group, Democracy International, an international development company that conducts projects for USAID, has had to furlough all 95 of its U.S.-based workers and 93% of its employees working on USAID projects in overseas offices, Wirth said.",
      "The federal government, he said, is terminating contracts \"en masse.\"",
      "Lawyers for the nonprofits said that organizations that receive foreign assistance grants have tried to draw down funding from USAID and the State Department, but have not been able to access their funds. In other instances, groups have had contracts terminated and pending invoices for completed work have not been paid, Wirth said.",
      "At least 230 USAID grants and contracts have been terminated or been subject to stop-work orders since Tuesday, Justice Department lawyers said in a filing.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that its decision to issue the 90-day pause on U.S. foreign development assistance allows it to ensure that the projects the U.S. is supporting align with the administration's foreign policy.",
      "Eric Hamilton, deputy assistant attorney general, said during the hearing that the issue is about how money that has been appropriated by Congress is being spent. He argued federal laws governing foreign assistance allow the president to determine how those funds should be used.",
      "He also noted that Rubio has approved a waiver for life-saving humanitarian assistance programs.",
      "The cases before Ali arose from recent efforts by the Trump administration to overhaul USAID, which was founded in 1961 and is an independent agency. Its operations have been in turmoil over the past few weeks amid the Trump administration's freeze on foreign assistance funding and stop-work orders for USAID contractors and agency partners. The administration also moved to shut down overseas USAID missions and recall thousands of employees living and working abroad. The administration last week\u00a0placed thousands of USAID employees on administrative leave and closed the aid agency's Washington, D.C., headquarters to staff.",
      "But some of Mr. Trump's efforts have been stopped by another federal judge in Washington in a separate case brought by labor unions.",
      "U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, appointed by Mr. Trump, temporarily prohibited the government from placing more than 2,000 employees on administrative leave. He also ordered the administration to reinstate employees already on leave and blocked expedited evacuations of USAID employees from their host countries.",

Under the agreement, if House committees don't achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts, then tax cuts would be lower than the proposed $4.5 trillion. But if they slash more than $2 trillion, tax cuts would be increased.",
      "The panels tasked with finding the steepest cuts are the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is instructed to propose at least $880 billion in cuts; the Education and Workforce Committee, with at least $330 billion; and the Agriculture Committee, with a minimum of $230 billion.",

Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Thursday that with the amendment in place tying tax cuts to spending cuts, he expects members will support the budget resolution.",
      "GOP Reps. Ralph Norman of South Dakota and Chip Roy of Texas, two House Freedom Caucus members who were seen as potential roadblocks on the budget panel, came out in favor of the proposal during Thursday's hearing.",
      "\"This budget put forward by the chairman is a giant step forward to reduce spending,\" Roy said. \"I believe that it is responsible, and I believe it is a balance of what we're supposed to do.\"",
      "Harris outlined that the agreement will \"allow the flexibility to actually bring the tax cuts even higher\" if there's more spending cuts. In terms of where to find the cuts, Harris wouldn't point to specifics, deferring to the committees on where to find savings.",
      "The House GOP's estimates project an increase of $2.5 trillion in revenues due to economic growth sparked by the trillions in tax cuts. Harris called that a \"conservative\" estimate and said that \"when it all balances out, we believe that \u2026 it's actually going to result in deficit reduction.\"",

    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers have so far set the probability of a crash at around 2%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's planetary defense office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation,\u00a0 which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 2%, it's still around 98% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 2%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 2% is a 98% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 98% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

      "New images captured by NASA's Curiosity rover show colorful clouds in the sky over Mars.",
      "The images were captured by the rover's Mastcam, which NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory compared to the rover's eyes. The clouds were spotted on Jan. 17, and the photos were taken over the course of 16 minutes, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The clouds, known as noctilucent or twilight clouds, contain frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. They are tinted with colors when the setting Sun scatters light. That color has led to them being nicknamed \"mother-of-pearl\" clouds.",
      "While Mars' atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, few of its clouds are at a high enough atmosphere and low enough temperature to contain frozen carbon dioxide. Most clouds on the planet are made of water ice. The clouds photographed by Curiosity are at an altitude of 37 to 50 miles above the planet's surface. Other images show the clouds as white plumes falling through the atmosphere, before evaporating about 31 miles above Mars.",
      "Did you know that Mars has *iridescent* clouds?Spotted by the @MarsCuriosity rover, these unique clouds are made of carbon dioxide ice and are only observed at twilight. What this helps us learn about the Red Planet: https://t.co/Snqyo49n1W pic.twitter.com/anXG7hf61K",
      "The twilight clouds have only been spotted in some areas of Mars' southern hemisphere. NASA's Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars' northern hemisphere in 2021, has not seen the clouds since it landed, but Curiosity has seen them in the southern hemisphere in four different Mars years.",
      "Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told NASA that he believes certain regions of the planet are more likely to form the clouds. Gravity waves, which cool a planet's atmosphere, could be a factor, he said.",
      "\"Carbon dioxide was not expected to be condensing into ice here, so something is cooling it to the point that it could happen,\" Lemmon said in NASA's news release. \"But Martian gravity waves are not fully understood and we're not entirely sure what is causing twilight clouds to form in one place but not another.\"",
      "Even though researchers don't totally understand how the clouds are formed, they can predict when and where they will appear. Lemmon, who was a lead researcher on a 2024 paper detailing Curiosity's first two years of cloud observations, said the phenomenon has \"become so predictable that we can plan our shots in advance.\"",
      "The new cloud photos aren't the only data Curiosity has sent back to NASA in recent weeks. The rover recently investigated a place called the Gediz Vallis channel, the space agency said.",
      "It also visited an impact crater nicknamed \"Rustic Canyon\" to take photos and study the rocks around the crater. The 67-foot wide crater likely formed millions of years ago, based on the erosion of the site, NASA said.",
      "The rover will continue on to a new location that includes what NASA called \"boxwork,\" or fractures in the planet's surface formed by groundwater. When seen from space, the fractures look like giant spiderwebs, NASA said.",

      "NASA plans to bring the two Starliner astronauts back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, around March 19-20, shortening their long-extended stay in orbit by about two weeks, the agency announced Tuesday.",
      "The slightly earlier-than-planned trip home was made possible by a tentative decision last week to switch the next set of station fliers \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as March 12, with weather and other factors considered.",
      "After a five-to-seven-day handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, will undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Assuming the dates hold up, Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week. That's how long Boeing and NASA managers thought it would take to complete the Starliner's first piloted test flight.",
      "As it turned out, the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and propellant leaks that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA originally planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but late last year, another month was added to the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch.",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the two astronauts in space. He said he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams. Musk also blamed Biden in a post on X.",

      "Flagstaff, Arizona \u2014 Scientists have long suspected that Mexican long-nosed bats migrate through southeastern Arizona, but without capturing and measuring the night-flying creatures, proof has been elusive.",
      "Researchers say they now have a way to tell the endangered species apart from other bats by analyzing saliva the nocturnal mammals leave behind when sipping nectar from plants and residential hummingbird feeders.",
      "Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group working to end the extinction of bat species worldwide, teamed up with residents from southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico and west Texas for the saliva swabbing campaign.",
      "The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers looked for environmental DNA - or eDNA - to confirm that the bats cycle through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home.",
      "The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1988 and is the only one in Arizona with that federal protection. It's an important species for pollinating cactus, agave and other desert plants.",
      "Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While expanding Arizona's list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down also deserves to be celebrated.",
      "\"If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA, biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these bats, and even then, you're not guaranteed to be successful,\" said Angie McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona's Game and Fish Department. \"By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our toolkit.\"",
      "Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return along the same route in the fall.",
      "The bat conservation group recruited ordinary citizens for the mission, giving them kits to swab samples from bird feeders throughout the summer and fall.",
      "Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that ultimately could detect the presence of bats. Part of the work involved a steady hand, with Riley using a syringe of sorts to transfer diluted DNA into tiny vials before popping them into a centrifuge.",
      "Sample after sample, vial after vial, the meticulous work took months.",
      "\"There's a big database that has DNA sequences of not every animal but most species, and so we could compare our DNA sequences we got from these samples to what's in the database,\" Riley said. \"A little bit like a Google search - you've got your question, you're asking Google, you plug it into the database, and it turns up you've got a bat, and you have this kind of bat.\"",
      "Kristen Lear, of the conservation group, said the collection of eDNA has been used successfully for determining the presence of other kinds of wildlife in various environments, so the group proposed trying it with bats.",

      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 2%, it's still around 98% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 2%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 2% is a 98% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 98% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

Most clouds on the planet are made of water ice. The clouds photographed by Curiosity are at an altitude of 37 to 50 miles above the planet's surface. Other images show the clouds as white plumes falling through the atmosphere, before evaporating about 31 miles above Mars.",

      "The California-based tech giant said it manually added \"a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries\" for several years, supplementing public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com that have been used to populate Google Calendar for over a decade. Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",
      "\"Maintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn't scalable or sustainable,\" Google said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.\"",

      "The men also allegedly threatened to expose stolen files, and allegedly operated a site on the dark web where stolen data was published. Victims of the scheme included a children's hospital, health care providers, and educational institutions, the Justice Department said. Victims lost data and money.",

      "\"The Trump administration is troubled by reports that some foreign governments are considering tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints,\" Vance said while speaking to world leaders and tech executives at the Artificial Intelligence Action summit in Paris, France. \"Now, America cannot and will not accept that, and we think it's a terrible mistake \u2014 not just for the United States of America \u2014 but for your own countries.\"",
      "Vance said the U.S. wants to ensure that the internet is a safe place, but suggested the European Union's Digital Services Act had gone too far, enacting \"massive regulations\" and \"policing so-called misinformation.\"",
      "\"It is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,\" Vance said.",

Last July, the EU found that the social media platform X, owned by Department of Government Effficiency head and Trump ally Elon Musk, did not comply with the act's transparency or accountability requirements.",

      "\"I want to be clear: this administration will block such efforts, full stop,\" Vance said. \"We will safeguard American A.I. and chip technologies from theft and misuse, work with our allies and partners to strengthen and extend these protections and close pathways to advert areas attaining A.I. capabilities that threaten all of our people.\"",
      "He extended the warning to allies as well.",

    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors in New York have filed a motion to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, bringing to a close a days-long battle that has upended the Justice Department over the decision to abandon the case.",
      "The motion to dismiss the five-count indictment was filed on the court's public docket on Friday and said, \"The Acting Deputy Attorney General has determined, pursuant to an authorization by the Attorney General, that dismissal is necessary and appropriate, and has directed the same, based on the unique facts and circumstances of this case.\"",
      "\"The Acting Deputy Attorney General concluded that dismissal is necessary because of appearances of impropriety and risks of interference with the 2025 elections in New York City,\" the filing said, adding, \"the Acting Deputy Attorney General also concluded that continuing these proceedings would interfere with the defendant's ability to govern in New York City.\"",
      "The judge overseeing the case must approve the motion before the charges are officially dropped.",
      "A senior career attorney from the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, the acting head of the Justice Department's criminal division and, notably, the acting deputy attorney general who is second in charge at the Justice Department jointly signed the motion.",
      "The decision to drop the case against Adams originated at Justice Department headquarters when former Trump attorney and Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a memo instructing prosecutors in Manhattan to abandon the five-count indictment that was filed in September.",
      "In a statement, Justice Department chief of staff Chad Mizelle said of the refusal by several department prosecutors to file for dismissal of Adams' case, \"The fact that those who indicted and prosecuted the case refused to follow a direct command is further proof of the disordered and ulterior motives of the prosecutors. Such individuals have no place at DOJ.\"",
      "Bove, in his directive, cited Adams' \"restricted\" ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies, and the case was to be dropped without prejudice, so the charges could be revived at a later time. He also made accusations that the charges stemmed from political weaponization. The move followed meetings between senior Justice Department officials, Southern District of New York prosecutors and Adams' attorneys about dropping the charges, a source familiar with the discussions confirmed to CBS News.",
      "What followed was an extraordinary internal revolt from Justice Department leadership and federal prosecutors in Manhattan, pushing back on the decision to drop the charges against New York's mayor. The internal disagreements burst into public view on Thursday, when the acting head of the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, Danielle Sassoon, resigned in protest.",
      "In a letter addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi and reviewed by CBS News, Sassoon offered her resignation and said the request to drop Adams' case \"raises serious concerns that render the contemplated dismissal inconsistent with my ability and duty to prosecute federal crimes without fear or favor and to advance good-faith arguments before the courts.\"",
      "Sassoon's letter to the attorney general alleged that during a meeting with Justice Department officials last month, Adams' attorneys \"urged what amounted to a quid pro quo,\" allegedly offering the mayor's cooperation with Trump administration priorities in exchange for the dismissal of the charges. Bove and Adams' legal team both rejected this assertion.",
      "\"It is a breathtaking and dangerous precedent to reward Adams's opportunistic and shifting commitments on immigration and other policy matters with the dismissal of a criminal indictment. Nor will a court likely find that such an improper exchange is consistent with the public interest,\" Sassoon wrote.",
      "In response, Bove wrote a letter back to Sassoon and accused her of insubordination. The acting deputy attorney general said he and Justice Department leadership stood by the decision to drop Adams' case, and Sassoon's refusal to comply interfered with the \"interests of justice.\"",
      "Bove wrote that because of the prosecution against Adams, the mayor \"is unable to communicate directly and candidly with City officials he is responsible for managing, as well as federal agencies trying to protect the public from national security threats and violent crime.\"",
      "He said his directive to drop the charges \"reflected a determination by the Justice Department that these public safety risks greatly outweigh any interest you have identified.\"",
      "The line prosecutors who worked on Adams' case have been placed on paid leave, pending investigations into Sassoon's conduct, Bove's letter revealed.",
      "Following Sassoon's resignation, supervision of the Adams case was transferred from Manhattan to Justice Department headquarters in Washington, D.C., where two additional leadership members \u2014 Kevin Driscoll of the Criminal Division and John Keller, acting head of the public integrity section \u2014 also resigned in protest, sources confirmed to CBS News. .",
      "Three additional senior officials in the public integrity unit in Washington, D.C., also resigned in the aftermath, two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "And on Friday, a line prosecutor in the Southern District of New York stepped down from his position and pushed back against the Trump administration's decision. In a scathing letter to Bove, Hagan Scotten defended Sassoon's work and the work of prosecutors who worked the Adams case, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"Any assistant U.S. attorney would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials in this way,\" he wrote. \"If there is no lawyer within earshot of the President who is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion.\"",
      "\"But it was never going to be me,\" Scotten said.",

      "\"Her commitment to integrity and the rule of law reflects the finest traditions of the Southern District United States Attorney's Office and the Department of Justice,\" they wrote. \"The Department's announced intent to investigate Ms. Sassoon and some of the career prosecutors who served alongside her is a stark departure from those traditions, and that should concern everyone committed to the pursuit of justice without fear or favor.\"",

      "He was to stand trial in April, and if convicted could have faced up to 45 years in prison.",
      "Dismissal comes after Adams meetings with Trump",
      "The stunning turn of events comes after Adams had high-profile meetings with President Trump. The two met in Florida while Mr. Trump was still president-elect. After that meeting, Adams said the two had not discussed his legal case at all.",
      "Adams then went on to cancel his plans to attend Martin Luther King, Jr. Day celebrations in New York City and instead attend Mr. Trump's inauguration, after receiving a last-minute invitation.",
      "When he was previously asked about the case against Adams, Mr. Trump said he thought Adams \"was treated pretty unfairly,\" and said he would consider a pardon. The dismissal of the case negates the need for any pardon.",
      "On Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was not involved with the decision to drop the case, telling members of the press, \"I didn't. I know nothing about it. I did not.\"",
      "Prosecutors recently appeared to be ramping up their case",
      "In her resignation letter, Sassoon, Manhattan's former top prosecutor, revealed her office had considered bringing additional charges against Adams focused on the alleged destruction of evidence and providing false statements to the FBI. Those charges were never filed.",
      "Early in January, prosecutors wrote in court documents that they had uncovered \"additional criminal conduct\" by the mayor. They didn't disclose what that other alleged criminal conduct was, however.",
      "At the time, Adams blasted the disclosure.",
      "\"You know, even Ray Charles can see what's going on. And I have an attorney, Alex Spiro, he is handling that. I've said over and over again, I've done nothing wrong,\" Adams said.",
      "Spiro called the move by prosecutors \"amateur hour,\" and accused them of \"looking for a headline instead of doing the right thing.\"",
      "Shortly after the initial charges against Adams were announced last fall, prosecutors said additional charges were \"quite likely.\"",
      "What's next for Adams",
      "The dismissal of the charges means Adams can fully focus his attention on running the city, as well as run for reelection.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 21:19:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Adams is at the center of a controversy over a directive by the Justice Department to drop corruption charges against him.",
    "story": [
      "Amid a swirl of resignations, charges and calls for New York City Mayor Eric Adams to step down, one person who remains in the mayor's corner is his predecessor.",
      "Bill de Blasio, the former New York City mayor and a fellow Democrat, believes the case against Adams should never have been brought. The charges, which include bribery and campaign finance allegations, \"were flimsy,\" de Blasio said in an interview Friday with CBS News.",
      "\"From Day One, I thought the charges against him were very weak,\" de Blasio said. \"I believe in my heart, and this is from personal experience, that we've got to have maturity to know that just because some prosecutor brings a charge doesn't mean it's true.\"",
      "On Monday, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a memo instructing former New York U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon's office to abandon the five-count indictment against Adams. Bove wrote that the case \"restricted\" Adams' ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies.",
      "Sassoon, who was Manhattan's top career federal prosecutor until Thursday, was among at least half a dozen Justice Department officials to resign after her office was directed to drop its criminal case against Adams.",
      "Adams, who pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing, was set to go to trial in April. Prosecutors said in a sprawling September indictment that Adams abused his power for years, using his influence to obtain illegal campaign contributions and free or discounted travel.",
      "Sassoon wrote in a letter to the attorney general Thursday that Adams' attorneys had \"urged what amounted to a quid pro quo,\" allegedly offering the mayor's cooperation with Trump administration priorities in immigration enforcement in exchange for dismissal of the charges.",
      "An attorney for Adams called that \"a total lie,\" and in a statement Friday, Adams also denied the allegation.",
      "\"I want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered \u2014 nor did anyone offer on my behalf \u2014 any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never,\" Adams said.",
      "Adams on Thursday announced an executive order allowing federal immigration agents to enter the city's Rikers Island jail complex \u2014 a major reversal of city policy. But de Blasio said he is skeptical that decisions like that are evidence of a deal with the White House.",
      "De Blasio said he didn't believe that was indicative of a quid pro quo arrangement. He called the move \"consistent with his previous positions that had nothing to do with his legal case.\"",
      "\"I've had my differences with Eric Adams, but I've known him a long time. He was a police officer for 20 years. He understands the law,\" de Blasio said. \"I am not surprised that he takes a different position on immigration than the rest of us (New York Democrats).\"",
      "De Blasio was broadly critical of the case and the prosecutors who brought it, saying the plan to go to trial just two months before the city's crucial Democratic primary was irresponsible.",
      "However, Sassoon, in her resignation letter Thursday, noted that the Justice Department had indicted Adams earlier. \"The Department of Justice correctly concluded that bringing charges nine months before a primary election was entirely appropriate,\" Sassoon wrote.",
      "De Blasio said he knows from experience the toll of being under investigation. He weathered his own federal probe related to campaign fundraising. It did not lead to charges. De Blasio said \"the process of defending yourself from a potential charge is time consuming\" and often means extra hours spent fundraising.",
      "He said an upcoming election was the elephant in the room.",
      "\"They were explicit that there was a clock in mind. They either had to prove their case or pull it,\" de Blasio said.",
      "In March 2017, acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim announced no charges would be brought against de Blasio. The announcement noted that Kim's office wanted to avoid influencing that year's race for City Hall.",
      "\"Although it is rare that we issue a public statement about the status of an investigation, we believe it appropriate in this case at this time, in order not to unduly influence the upcoming campaign and Mayoral election,\" Kim said.",
      "Adams and Bove called the case against him politically motivated, echoing complaints made about other cases by Bove's former defense client, President Trump.",
      "De Blasio thinks the parallel ends there.",
      "\"It's apples to oranges. For all things related to Trump, there was massive evidence in public view. No one's ever shown evidence of bribery (against Adams),\" de Blasio said.",
      "Mr. Trump was convicted in New York last year of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. He is appealing that conviction. A criminal case in Georgia is on indefinite hold, and a federal case against Mr. Trump was dropped after he was elected in November, because pursuing it further would have violated Justice Department policy regarding sitting presidents. Another federal case was dismissed last summer.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied all allegations and accused various prosecutors of charging him for political gain.",
      "Adams' critics have accused him of cozying up to Trump in order to make his case go away. De Blasio said Adams can show that's untrue through open opposition to Trump policies.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 19:25:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is firing thousands of federal workers on probationary status, or those without civil service protections.",
    "story": [
      "Probational federal employees who lost their jobs on Thursday as part of the Trump administration's mass\u00a0firing of government workers\u00a0expressed shock and anger at the terminations, which they contend will hurt the government's ability to provide services.",
      "President Trump is moving quickly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 saying he is slashing wasteful spending and pushing to make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's policies. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "Federal workers who received termination notices on Thursday described receiving nonpersonalized emails informing them they had been removed from their position, with little communication from their supervisors. The workers said they had entered public service because of a commitment to serve the public interest, whether by helping protect consumers from predatory financial services or by supporting veterans.",
      "\"We had all received these notices that cites probationary regulations and says we're being let go because 'you are not fit for continued employment because your ability and skills do not fit the agency's needs,'\" Elizabeth Aniskevich, an attorney with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS News.",
      "A termination letter provided to CBS News by a former employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs informed the worker that his job was ending because \"you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.\"",
      "The VA worker, who had previously held federal jobs across different agencies for more than a decade, said he was dismayed to learn that he was considered a probationary worker after taking the Veterans Affairs job last fall, as it reset his government employment.",
      "\"Basically the gist [of the termination letter] is laying out I was a probationary employee, what my rights of appeal are, but my continued employment was no longer in the public interest,\" said the VA worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his chances of finding another government job. \"I came into the house \u2014 probably for a couple weeks my wife and I joked, 'Did I still have a job?' \u2014 I told her, and I lost it. It's devastating.\"",
      "Another VA employee, who told CBS News his work was rated as \"outstanding\" in his most recent performance review, said receiving an impersonal termination letter was hurtful.",
      "\"It feels like a copy/paste mass firing that takes nothing into account of the people, the human cost,\" said Greg House, 34, a disabled veteran who was terminated from his job at the VA's public affairs office in Salt Lake City, a job that he started in March 2024. He added, \"The idea that the federal workforce is too bloated feels like a scapegoat more than anything else. Nobody joins the federal government to get rich.\"",
      "The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has instructed agencies to report their final numbers of fired probationary employees by 8 p.m Eastern time on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "The White House press office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Unions claim firings are illegal",
      "Five unions for government employees have sued Mr. Trump and other officials in his administration over the firing of probationary workers, alleging the move is illegal because it violates procedures for making \"reductions in force,\" a formal process used by government agencies to dismiss employees.",
      "Reductions in force, or RIFs, can be made based on a number of issues, such as if there's not enough work or funding for federal workers, according to OPM.",
      "Mr. Trump's order \"directs agencies to promptly engage in RIFs for none of the specified, allowable reasons, but instead for the purpose of 'eliminating waste, bloat and insularity,'\" the lawsuit claims, citing the president's Feb. 11 executive order for widespread layoffs of government workers.",
      "Some experts are pushing back on the idea that the government workforce is too large, pointing out that federal employment has grown little since 1980. Prior to the firings, some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration.",
      "Impact on services",
      "The VA employee who was fired Thursday said he took exception to Mr. Trump's claim that the terminations would make the government more efficient, noting that his group, which had been trying to fill several empty positions, had more work than they could handle.",
      "\"We are under-resourced as it is, so cutting jobs won't do it,\" he said, adding that the firings will directly impact veterans. \"We have ongoing projects to try to construct and repair facilities to help veterans \u2014 we're already behind.\"",
      "A Food and Drug Administration employee \u2014 who also requested anonymity because she's in a probationary period in her job but hasn't received a termination letter \u2014 expressed concern that the firings would slow essential work, both because of the loss of skilled employees and a hit to employee morale.",
      "\"We're rather leanly staffed \u2014 the people on some of these teams have a tremendous workload,\" she said. \"It'll slow down things like drugs approvals ... it'll have a tremendous, terrible impact on access to drugs and generic drugs.\"",
      "Because many of the probationary workers are younger employees, the firings could add to long-term problems facing the federal workforce, where twice as many workers are over age 60 than under 30, said Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School.",
      "\"This will exacerbate the existing human capital crisis if probationary employees are more likely to be young, and more likely to have the skills that a 21st century government operation needs,\" she said.",
      "Where jobs are getting cut",
      "As of May 2024, the most recent data available, about 216,000 federal employees had been in their jobs for less than one year, according to government data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "The government agency with the most probationary employees is the VA, with about 56,000 workers bearing that designation, OPM data shows. The VA on Friday said it had fired more than 1,000 employees. The agency didn't respond to a request for comment about whether more firings could be coming.",
      "\"Make no mistake \u2014 Trump is looking to fire probationary employees because it is easy, not because it is good for veterans or cost-effective,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut who serves on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, told CBS News in a statement. \"In fact, it is a massive waste of taxpayer dollars to fire employees the department just invested months into recruiting, vetting and training.\"",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials expect most of the agency's roughly 5,200 probationary employees to be fired Friday, Feb. 14, under the Trump administration's move to get rid of nearly all probationary employees, according to an audio recording of a National Institutes of Health department meeting obtained by the Associated Press.",
      "In that meeting, an NIH office director told employees that some probationary staff with specialized skills might retain their positions. Probationary staff being terminated would receive an email Friday afternoon, the AP reported, citing the recording.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday moved to fire more than 400 employees at the Department of Homeland Security, the latest effort in a government-wide campaign to dramatically reduce the federal workforce.",
      "Officials at DHS said they had fired hundreds of employees across several of its agencies after supervisors identified \"non-mission critical personnel in probationary status\" within the nation's top cybersecurity agency, known as CISA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers the nation's legal immigration system, among others.",
      "\"Under President Trump's leadership, we are making sweeping cuts and reform across the federal government to eliminate egregious waste and incompetence that has been happening for decades at the expense of the American taxpayer,\" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "McLaughlin said the personnel cuts will result in roughly $50 million in savings, and be \"incalculably valuable\" to the administration's efforts to cut red tape, adding that the department is \"actively identifying other wasteful positions and offices that do not do not fulfill DHS' mission.\"",
      "In total, over 200 personnel have been fired from FEMA, the nation's disaster relief agency. The eliminations follow DHS' announcement earlier this week that four FEMA employees would be terminated over payments to reimburse New York City for hotel costs for migrants.

Transport boxes, electronic scales and gaffs, sharp blades that can be attached to roosters' legs during fights, were found on the property, the news statement said.",

      "In letters to the editor published Thursday in The Financial Times and the Los Angeles Times, Anne and Lucy Dayton said their father, Bruce Dayton, along with his four other brothers, expanded the Minneapolis department store into a massive brand that became Target that was built on two principles: a focus on the customer and the well-being of the community.",
      "Bruce Dayton died in 2015 at 97.",

      "They added that, \"By cowering, Target and others are undermining the very principles that have made their companies a success.\"",
      "Target couldn't be immediately reached for comment.",
      "In late January, Target said the changes to its \"Belonging at the Bullseye\" strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.",
      "Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it already had planned to end the racial program this year. The company also said that it would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.",
      "Following the announcement, activists called for a nationwide boycott of Target stores. Speakers at a Minneapolis rally in late January said they felt it was not a coincidence that Target rolled back on its diversity initiatives a week before Black History Month.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Seattle put a pause on President Trump's directive that seeks to restrict access to gender-affirming care for young people under the age of 19, becoming the second in so many days to halt the president's efforts to target access to the treatments.",
      "The order from U.S. District Judge Lauren King was issued Friday as part of a legal challenge brought one week ago by a group of three states \u2014 Washington, Minnesota and Oregon \u2014 and three physicians who provide the care for transgender patients being treated for gender dysphoria.",
      "King, appointed by former President Joe Biden, held a hearing earlier Friday on the states' bid to temporarily bar enforcement of Mr. Trump's order limiting access to gender-affirming care for young people. A brief entry on the court's docket indicated that King had agreed to grant a temporary restraining order and would issue a written order.",
      "The block will remain in place while legal proceedings move forward.",
      "King's decision follows a similar move by a federal judge in Maryland, who on Thursday\u00a0temporary halted Mr. Trump's executive action for 14 days. His order came in a case brought by the ACLU on behalf of a group of seven transgender youth and two LGBTQ rights organizations.",
      "The president's directive, issued in his first week in office, threatens research and education grants awarded to medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to patients under the age of 19. Treatments covered by the order include puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures.",
      "The Democrat-led states that sued the Trump administration over the order said it deprives transgender youth of life-saving medical care. They called it a \"cruel and baseless broadside against transgender youth, their families, and the doctors and medical institutions that provide them this critical care.\"",
      "\"It is an official statement of bigotry from the president that directs agencies to openly discriminate against vulnerable youth on the basis of their transgender status and sex,\" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. \"It is also a blatant abuse of power. The order usurps spending and legislative powers belonging exclusively to Congress, and seizes the States' historic police powers to regulate the practice of medicine in violation of the Tenth Amendment.\"",
      "But the White House has defended the order as part of an effort to protect children from treatments that can have negative health consequences and that lack evidence as to their efficacy. Justice Department lawyers wrote in a court filing that the suit is also premature, as federal agencies have not threatened to revoke any particular grants at issue in the executive order.",
      "Additionally, the Justice Department said Article II of the Constitution gives the president the authority to direct agencies to take steps to further his administration's policies.",
      "\"That sort of order \u2014 cutting off at the jump the ability of the Executive Branch to even pursue a general course of action \u2014 would be a remarkable intrusion on a separate branch of government, in conflict with Article II,\" they argued in the filing. \"The president has the constitutional authority to direct his subordinates to pursue a general policy goal, consistent with all applicable law.\"",
      "Half of the states have enacted laws in recent years that limit access to gender-affirming care for minors. The Supreme Court is currently considering the constitutionality of one of those laws, from Tennessee, and will likely issue a decision in the challenge brought by former President Joe Biden's administration, three families and a doctor by the beginning of July.",

Instead, the White House says it will open AP's spot in the White House press pool to other reporters.",
      "\"The Associated Press continues to ignore the lawful geographic name change of the Gulf of America,\" wrote White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich. \"This decision is not just divisive, but it also exposes the Associated Press' commitment to misinformation. While their right to irresponsible and dishonest reporting is protected by the First Amendment, it does not ensure their privilege of unfettered access to limited spaces, like the Oval Office and Air Force One. Going forward, that space will now be opened up to the many thousands of reporters who have been barred from covering these intimate areas of the administration. Associated Press journalists and photographers will retain their credentials to the White House complex.\"",
      "The AP is a regular representative in the White House press pool, the rotating group of reporters, videographers and photographers who cover the president daily and travel with him whenever he leaves White House grounds. The AP is a news wire service that covers the globe, and local newspapers have increasingly relied on it and other syndicated news outlets as local newsrooms undergone staffing reductions.

It noted that Mr. Trump's order only carries authority within the U.S. and other countries did not have to recognize the change. The wire service's guide said that as an international agency, \"the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.\"",

      "The White House Correspondents Association, which represents hundreds of reporters who cover the White House, criticized the White House after it barred AP reporters from a news conference with President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.",
      "\"The White House's decision to bar Associated press reporters from today's press conference with President Trump and Prime Minister Modi is outrageous and a deeply disappointing escalation of an already unacceptable situation,\" the WHCA said. \"Let me be clear: the White House is seeking to curtail press freedoms enshrined in our Constitution, and has publicly admitted they are restricting access to events to punish a news outlet for not advancing the government's preferred language.\"",
      "The WHCA also said the White House's decision constituted a \"textbook violation of not only the First Amendment, but the president's own executive order on freedom of speech and ending federal censorship.\"",
      "After AP's ban from the Trump-Modi news conference, AP executive editor Julie Pace also called the White House's decision a \"plain violation of the First Amendment,\" and she urged the Trump administration \"in the strongest terms possible to stop this practice.\"",

Let's do the minerals agreement, so we'll have our American business interest. Putin doesn't understand what's going on. If we sign this minerals agreement, Putin is screwed, because Trump will defend the deal.\"",

      "In remarks at the conference, Vance reiterated that Mr. Trump would like to see European allies in NATO contribute at least 5% of their gross domestic product to increased security spending, and he also made that point in meetings with European leaders.",
      "\"While the Trump administration is very concerned with European security, and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine, we also believe that it's important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance lectured Europeans at the conference, telling them, \"The threat that I worry the most about vis-\u00e0-vis Europe is not Russia; it's not China.\"",
      "\"What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America,\" the vice president said.",

    "summary": "Researchers who sniffed mummified remains in the name of science described them as \"woody,\" \"spicy,\" and \"sweet,\" with floral notes.",
    "story": [
      "At first whiff, it sounds repulsive: sniff the essence of an ancient corpse.",
      "But researchers who indulged their curiosity in the name of science found that well-preserved Egyptian mummies actually smell pretty good.",
      "\"In films and books, terrible things happen to those who smell mummified bodies,\" said Cecilia Bembibre, director of research at University College London's Institute for Sustainable Heritage. \"We were surprised at the pleasantness of them.\"",
      "\"Woody,\" \"spicy\" and \"sweet\" were the leading descriptions from what sounded more like a wine tasting than a mummy sniffing exercise. Floral notes were also detected, which could be from pine and juniper resins used in embalming.",
      "The study published Thursday in the Journal of the American Chemical Society used both chemical analysis and a panel of human sniffers to evaluate the odors from nine mummies as old as 5,000 years that had been either in storage or on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.",
      "The researchers wanted to systematically study the smell of mummies because it has long been a subject of fascination for the public and researchers alike, said Bembibre, one of the report's authors. Archeologists, historians, conservators and even fiction writers have devoted pages of their work to the subject \u2014 for good reason.",
      "Scent was an important consideration in the mummification process, which used oils, waxes and balms to preserve the body and its spirit for the afterlife. The practice was largely reserved for pharaohs and nobility. Pleasant smells were associated with purity and deities, while bad odors were signs of corruption and decay.",
      "Without sampling the mummies themselves, which would be invasive, researchers from UCL and the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia were able to measure whether aromas were coming from the archaeological item, pesticides or other products used to conserve the remains, or from deterioration due to mold, bacteria or microorganisms.",
      "\"We were quite worried that we might find notes or hints of decaying bodies, which wasn't the case,\" said Matija Strli\u010d, a chemistry professor at the University of Ljubljana. \"We were specifically worried that there might be indications of microbial degradation, but that was not the case, which means that the environment in this museum, is actually quite good in terms of preservation.\"",
      "Using technical instruments to measure and quantify air molecules emitted from sarcophagi to determine the state of preservation without touching the mummies was like the Holy Grail, Strli\u010d said.",
      "\"It tells us potentially what social class a mummy was from and and therefore reveals a lot of information about the mummified body that is relevant not just to conservators, but to curators and archeologists as well,\" he said. \"We believe that this approach is potentially of huge interest to other types of museum collections.\"",
      "Barbara Huber, a postdoctoral researcher at Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Germany who was not involved in the study, said the findings provide crucial data on compounds that could preserve or degrade mummified remains. The information could be used to better protect the ancient bodies for future generations.",
      "\"However, the research also underscores a key challenge: the smells detected today are not necessarily those from the time of mummification,\" Huber said. \"Over thousands of years, evaporation, oxidation, and even storage conditions have significantly altered the original scent profile.\"",
      "Huber authored a study two years ago that analyzed residue from a jar that had contained mummified organs of a noblewoman to identify embalming ingredients, their origins and what they revealed about trade routes. She then worked with a perfumer to create an interpretation of the embalming scent, known as \"Scent of Eternity,\" for an exhibition at the Moesgaard Museum in Denmark.",
      "Researchers of the current study hope to do something similar, using their findings to develop \"smellscapes\" to artificially recreate the scents they detected and enhance the experience for future museumgoers.",
      "\"Museums have been called white cubes, where you are prompted to read, to see, to approach everything from a distance with your eyes,\" Bembibre said. \"Observing the mummified bodies through a glass case reduces the experience because we don't get to smell them. We don't get to know about the mummification process in an experiential way, which is one of the ways that we understand and engage with the world.\"",

      "Vice President JD Vance hammered home the United States demand that the NATO alliance step up defense spending on Friday, ahead of a security meeting in Europe at a time of intense concern and uncertainty over the Trump administration's foreign policy.",
      "The future of Ukraine is the top item on the agenda at the Munich Security Conference following a phone call between U.S. President Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, when they pledged to work together to end the 3-year-old Russia-Ukraine conflict.",
      "Vance is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later Friday for talks that many observers, particularly in Europe, hope will shed at least some light on Trump's ideas for a negotiated settlement to the war.",
      "Vance started his day in Munich meeting separately with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and British foreign secretary David Lammy. He used the engagements to reiterate the Republican Trump administration's call for NATO members to spend more on defense. Currently, 23 of NATO's 32 member nations are hitting the Western military alliance's target of spending 2% of the nation's GDP on defense.",
      "\"NATO is a very important military alliance, of course, that we're the most significant part of,\" Vance told Rutte. \"But we want to make sure that NATO is actually built for the future, and we think a big part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden sharing in Europe, so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia.\"",
      "Rutte said he agreed that Europe needs to step up. \"We have to grow up in that sense and spend much more,\" he said.",
      "Hours before Vance and Zelenskyy were set to meet, a Russian drone with a high-explosive warhead hit the protective confinement shell of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Kyiv region, the Ukrainian president said. Radiation levels have not increased, Zelenskyy and the U.N. atomic agency said.",
      "Zelenskyy in Munich told reporters that he thinks the Chernobyl drone strike is a \"very clear greeting from Putin and Russian Federation to the security conference.\"",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday denied Ukraine's claims. And Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the Munich organizers haven't invited Russia for several years, a decision she called \"strange and politicized.\"",

He took a different aircraft, but it was unclear whether he would arrive in time for the meeting.",
      "Trump, who upended years of steadfast U.S. support for Ukraine during his call with Putin on Wednesday, has been vague about his specific intentions - other than suggesting that a deal will likely result in Ukraine being forced to cede territory that Russia has seized since it annexed Crimea in 2014.",
      "\"The Ukraine war has to end,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"Young people are being killed at levels that nobody's seen since World War II. And it's a ridiculous war.\"",
      "Trump's musings have left Europeans in a quandary, wondering how - or even if - they can maintain the post-WWII security that NATO afforded them or fill the gap in the billions of dollars of security assistance that the Democratic Biden administration provided to Ukraine since Russia's February 2022 invasion.",
      "Trump has been highly skeptical of that aid and is expected to cut or otherwise limit it as negotiations get underway in the coming days.",
      "Both Trump and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week undercut Ukraine's hopes of becoming part of NATO, which the alliance said less than a year ago was \"irreversible,\" or of getting back its territory captured by Russia, which currently occupies close to 20% including Crimea.",
      "\"I don't see any way that a country in Russia's position could allow ... them to join NATO,\" Trump said Thursday. \"I don't see that happening.\"",
      "But British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Zelenskyy on Friday that Ukraine must be allowed to join NATO.",
      "Trump in recent days said he wants to reach an agreement with Ukraine to gain access to the country's rare earth materials as a condition for continuing U.S. support for Ukraine's defense against Russia. He confirmed earlier this week that aides were working toward striking such a deal.",
      "Asked Friday if a deal might be completed in Munich, Vance responded, \"We'll see.\"",
      "Vance, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, said that the U.S. would hit Moscow with sanctions and potentially military action if Putin won't agree to a peace deal with Ukraine that guarantees Kyiv's long-term independence.",
      "The warning that military options \"remain on the table\" was striking language from a Trump administration that's repeatedly underscored a desire to quickly end the war.",
      "The U.S. reassurances may have somewhat allayed Zelenskyy's fears, although they will not replace any lost military or economic support that President Joe Biden's administration had provided.",
      "The Ukrainian leader conceded Thursday that it was \"not very pleasant\" that Trump spoke first to Putin. But he said the main issue was to \"not allow everything to go according to Putin's plan.\"",
      "\"We cannot accept it, as an independent country, any agreements (made) without us,\" Zelenskyy said as he visited a nuclear power plant in western Ukraine.",

He warned that handing a victory to Russia in Ukraine could have repercussions in Asia, too.",

    "summary": "Pope Francis was to be hospitalized for bronchitis treatment and necessary diagnostic testing after his Friday audiences, the Vatican said.",
    "story": [
      "Pope Francis was to be hospitalized to treat bronchitis and undergo some necessary diagnostic tests, the Vatican said Friday, confirming the latest issues with the 88-year-old's pontiff's health. A spokesperson said he was expected to be there for \"a few days.\"",
      "Francis was diagnosed with bronchitis last Thursday, but has continued to hold daily audiences in his Vatican hotel suite, attended his general audience Wednesday and even presided at an outdoor Mass on Sunday. He has, however, handed off his speeches for an aide to read aloud, saying he was having trouble breathing.",
      "Francis, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has long battled health problems, especially long bouts of acute bronchitis in winter. He uses a wheelchair, walker or cane when moving around his apartment and recently fell twice, hurting his arm and chin.",
      "Ever since his diagnosis, Francis has appeared bloated, an indication the medication he was taking to treat the lung infection was making him retain water.",
      "Francis is being hospitalized at Rome's Gemelli hospital, where he was last hospitalized in June 2023 to have surgery to remove intestinal scar tissue and repair a hernia in the abdominal wall. A few months before that, he spent three days in the hospital to receive intravenous antibiotics for a respiratory infection.",
      "A Vatican statement said Francis would be admitted at the end of his Friday audiences. In addition to regular Vatican officials, the pope met Friday morning with the Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, and the head of CNN, Mark Thompson.",
      "\"This morning, at the end of the audiences, Pope Francis will be admitted to the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic for some necessary diagnostic tests and to continue in a hospital setting treatment for bronchitis that is still ongoing,\" the statement said.",
      "The Vatican didn't provide details of the duration of Francis' hospitalization or what would come of his scheduled events. He has a busy weekend agenda with another special Holy Year event planned, this time honoring artists. On the calendar is an audience with artists Saturday, a Mass on Sunday and a trip to Rome's famed Cinecitta studios on Monday.",
      "The Vatican announcement, delivered ahead of Francis' hospitalization, came in sharp contrast to the 2023 hospitalization for bronchitis that caused confusion.",
      "Initially, the Vatican had said he had gone in for scheduled tests, but the pontiff later revealed he had felt pain in his chest and was rushed to the hospital where bronchitis was diagnosed. He was put on intravenous antibiotics and was released April 1, quipping as he left that he was \"still alive.\"",
      "Francis spent 10 days at the same hospital in July 2021 following intestinal surgery for a bowel narrowing.",

    "summary": "Hamas says it will adhere to the ongoing ceasefire in Gaza after threatening to delay the next release of 3 Israeli hostages.",
    "story": [
      "Hamas said Thursday that it would continue releasing hostages according to the terms of the ceasefire and hostage release deal with Israel, several days after it accused Israel of violating the agreement and said it would delay the next scheduled exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Under the terms of the deal between Israel and Hamas, which is a U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group, that exchange is set to take place on Saturday, with the release of three more Israeli hostages and dozens more Palestinian prisoners.",
      "\"Hamas confirms continuation in implementing the agreement in accordance with what was signed, including the exchange of prisoners according to the specified timetable,\" Hamas said in a statement.",
      "Hamas said it had spoken to negotiators in Egypt and Qatar about, \"the necessity of adhering to implementing all terms\" of the the agreement with Israel, particularly relating to \"securing housing for our people and urgently bringing in caravans, tents, heavy equipment, medical supplies, fuel, and continuing the flow of humanitarian aid, as stipulated in the agreement.\"",
      "Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of breaching the agreement multiple times, but it has remained in effect, halting the 15-month war in Gaza sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Thursday that it had detected a rocket launch within Gaza, but that the weapon fell inside the Palestinian territory, and that the IDF remained \"committed to fully implementing the conditions of the agreement for the return of the hostages.\"",
      "The IDF said it had \"struck the launcher from which the rocket launch in the Gaza Strip was identified,\" but provided no further information. There was no immediate comment from Gaza's Hamas rulers about the rocket launch.",
      "On Monday, Hamas accused Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire agreement by not allowing the full amount of aid that had been agreed upon to enter Gaza and by firing on Palestinians trying to return to their homes in the decimated Palestinian territory. It said at the time that it would not free the next three hostages on Saturday as called for in the deal.",
      "Israel replied quickly, saying that if Hamas failed to release those hostages, it would resume its military operations in Gaza.",
      "President Trump went further, saying Hamas should free all of the remaining Israeli hostages \u2014 almost 80 people, though some are known to have been killed \u2014 on Saturday, or \"all hell is going to break loose.\" Israel never explicitly backed that suggested change in the ceasefire terms.",
      "Mr. Trump has also drawn a fierce backlash from regional partners and allies around the world for suggesting a plan to relocate Gaza's roughly 2.3 million Palestinian inhabitants to other countries, and for the U.S. to \"take over\" the territory and turn it into a real estate development.",
      "CBS News' team in Gaza said the Israeli military allowed 150 aid trucks loaded with tents to enter the enclave overnight Wednesday, and that it had promised to allow in mobile caravans for housing, too.",
      "Negotiations have begun for the second phase of the deal, which, if agreed, would see even more hostages released by Hamas and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Under the terms of the agreement, the current six-week first phase is to see 33 Israeli hostages released in exchange for thousands of Palestinian prisoners. So far, 21 hostages have been freed, including American-Israeli dual national Keith Siegel.",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who was among those to condemn Mr. Trump's plan for Gaza, urged Hamas to resume hostage releases and \"avoid at all costs\" any resumption of fighting in the territory.",
      "Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz said Wednesday that if fighting did resume in Gaza, it would \"not end without Hamas' defeat and the release of all the hostages,\" adding that it would \"also enable the realization of US President Trump's vision for Gaza.\"",
      "In Hamas' terrorist attack on southern Israel in October 2023 some 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage. Israel's retaliatory war against Hamas has killed more than 48,000 people in Gaza, according to the enclave's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",

    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have uncovered the remnants of London's earliest-known ancient Roman basilica on the site of a planned 32-story skyscraper, right in the heart of what was once known as Londinium. Excavations in the basement of a building slated to be demolished to make way for the the new tower at 85 Gracechurch Street uncovered flint, brick and ragstone walls and foundations over three feet wide, 13 feet deep and almost two millennia old.",
      "Sophie Jackson of the Museum of London Archaeology called it \"one of the most significant discoveries\" in years in British capital's oldest quarter, the City of London \u2014 the square-mile financial district where modern glass high-rises stand atop the remnants of Victorian, medieval and much earlier structures.",
      "The scientists say they have uncovered the foundations of a two-story building that was almost as big as an Olympic swimming pool. It was constructed between 78 and 84 A.D., about three decades after Roman troops invaded the British isles and roughly 20 years after forces of the Celtic warrior queen Boudicca sacked the fledgling settlement.",
      "The basilica was part of the forum, the social, political and commercial heart of Roman London, or Londinium, as it was called, where people went to shop, mingle, seek justice and hear the latest edicts from political leaders. The newly discovered remains are believed to form part of the tribunal, a raised area of the forum where politicians and officials made decisions about the city's governance.",
      "\"We're talking about the early stages of London here,\" said Andrew Henderson-Schwartz, head of public impact at Museum of London Archaeology. \"But it's a real sign of investment in the city, even in its early infancy.\"",
      "Developer Hertshten Properties, which owns the site and has planning permission for a new office tower, has agreed to incorporate the remains into its plans and put them on display in a visitor center.",
      "Henderson-Schwartz said the extent of the \"absolutely massive\" foundations discovered in several test pits dug by archaeologists suggests an \"extraordinary\" level of preservation of the building ruins.",
      "Further digging could answer intriguing questions, including why the original forum was only used for 20 years before being replaced by a much larger one, which remained in use until the collapse of Roman rule in Britain three centuries later. Items such as writing tablets, styluses \u2014 even ancient trash \u2014 could offer glimpses into the daily lives of Roman Londoners.",
      "Property developers in Britain routinely have to bring in archaeologists as consultants as part of the construction planning process, a practice that has uncovered finds from Anglo-Saxon jewelry and remains and medieval ice skates to the skeletons of 14th-century plague victims.",
      "The latest discovery adds to the traces of Roman London that can be seen around the city, including a section of the ancient wall that once surrounded Londinium, a portion of an amphitheater and a temple to the god Mithras that lies incongruously under the modern headquarters of information company Bloomberg.",
      "\"We do have these little windows into Roman London that are all over the city,\" Henderson-Schwartz said. \"But this is really in some ways the site that connects them all together. This is the heart of Rome in London, where all the decisions were made.\"",
      "Elsewhere in England, archaeologists have recently discovered a \"mysterious lump\" of a purple substance that in Roman times would have been worth more than gold, and a stash of coins worth over $125,000 dating back to the reign of Emperor Nero.",

      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "While Musk has spoken to the summit in the past, his appearance Thursday comes as he has consolidated control over large swaths of the government with Mr. Trump's blessing since assuming leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency. That's included sidelining career officials, gaining access to sensitive databases and inviting a constitutional clash over the limits of presidential authority.",
      "Musk's new role gave his comments more weight beyond being the world's wealthiest person through his investments in SpaceX and electric carmaker Tesla.",
      "His remarks also offered a more-isolationist view of American power in the Middle East, where the U.S. has fought wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.",
      "\"A lot of attention has been on USAID for example,\" Musk said, referring to Mr. Trump's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. \"There's like the National Endowment for Democracy. But I'm like, 'O.K. Well, how much democracy have they achieved lately?'\"",
      "He added that the U.S. under Mr. Trump is \"less interested in interfering with the affairs of other countries.\"",
      "There are \"times the United States has been kind of pushy in international affairs, which may resonate with some members of the audience,\" Musk said, speaking to the crowd in the UAE, an autocratically ruled nation of seven sheikhdoms.",
      "\"Basically, America should mind its own business, rather than push for regime change all over the place,\" he said.",
      "He also noted the Trump administration's focus on eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion work, at one point linking it to AI.",
      "\"If hypothetically, AI is designed for DEI, you know, diversity at all costs, it could decide that there's too many men in power and execute them,\" Musk said.",
      "On AI, Musk said he believed X's newly updated AI chatbot, Grok 3, would be ready in about two weeks, calling it at one point \"kind of scary.\" He criticized Sam Altman's management of OpenAI, which Musk just led a $97.4 billion takeover bid for, describing it as akin to a nonprofit aimed at saving the Amazon rainforest becoming a \"lumber company that chops down the trees.\"",
      "Musk also announced plans for a \"Dubai Loop\" project in line with his work in the Boring Company - which is digging tunnels in Las Vegas to speed transit. However, he and the Emirati government official speaking with him offered no immediate details of the plan.",
      "\"It's going to be like a wormhole,\" Musk promised. \"You just wormhole from one part of the city \u2014 boom \u2014 and you're out in another part of the city.\"",

      "\"But a voice is not just a sound. And I\u2019d like to think that no matter how much an AI version of Moe or Snake or Chief Wiggum will sound like my voice, something will still be missing \u2014 the humanness.

      "AI expert Marva Bailer told Fox News Digital, \"When we look at animated characters, there is a person behind that character and there's also a person behind the voice, because we identify the character with the image, but also that unique voice and voices aren't just reading a script.

And so his point that he's trying to make is he's actually developing these characters over time, and he's developing them through his life experience.\"",

      "\"Something that AI does for us is if we have an idea or creativity, and we want to know what something sounds like or thinks like or looks like, and maybe we don't have it in our repertoire or our community, it can give us those inspirations,\" Bailer said. \"And that's really what Hank is bringing to the picture.\"",

      "Each vaccine was personalized to match the individual patient\u2019s tumor type based on cancer cells that were removed during surgery. These cells contain \"neoantigens,\" which are \"tiny fragments of mutant proteins,\" the release stated.

    "story": [
      "Harvard medical student and researcher Nick Norwitz recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet.",
      "Meat enthusiasts have long endorsed the \"carnivore diet,\" a meal plan that includes consuming only animal products such as meat, dairy and eggs \u2014 but the program is frowned upon by some who embrace plant-based foods like vegetables, fruits, grains and legumes.",
      "A Harvard medical student and researcher, Nick Norwitz, recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet. (See the video at the top of this article, and more videos at https://www.youtube.com/@nicknorwitzPhD.)",
      "Norwitz \u2014 a self-described \"academician\" with a PhD in metabolic health, who is currently finishing his medical degree \u2014 told Fox News Digital that he's always had a passion for sharing his \"joy and interest\"\u00a0in science.",
      "RED MEAT COULD RAISE DEMENTIA RISK, RESEARCHERS CLAIM",
      "See Norwitz's eight myths below \u2014 followed by input and perspective from other health experts.",
      "Myth No. 1: There is no evidence for the carnivore diet",
      "Norwitz noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet, including a Harvard study of 2,029 participants that found \"high levels of satisfaction and improvements in overall health, well-being and various medical conditions.\"",
      "Other research that Norwitz himself conducted showed that the diet helped to alleviate inflammatory\u00a0bowel disease and restrictive eating disorders, he said.",
      "A Harvard medical student and researcher, Nick Norwitz, recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz)",
      "While he called the results \"impressive\" and claimed that thousands of people have benefited from the carnivore diet, Norwitz noted that randomized controlled trials have not been conducted.",
      "\"These trials will need to be completed before conventional medicine can recommend a carnivore diet as a metabolic health prevention for any specific disorder,\" he says in his video.",
      "Myth No. 2: The diet increases the risk of scurvy",
      "Some claim that a carnivore diet could increase the risk of scurvy due to a vitamin C deficiency, Norwitz said.",
      "\"While it\u2019s true it's difficult to meet the RDA daily dose of 75 to 90 milligrams of vitamin C by eating only meat, there are about 25 micrograms per gram of vitamin C in fresh, grass-fed beef, so eating about 2 pounds of meat daily should give you about 18 milligrams of vitamin C.\"",
      "MEAT 'CHEAT MEALS' AMONG VEGETARIANS, VEGANS 'MORE COMMON THAN YOU MIGHT THINK'",
      "While this is still well below the recommended daily amount, Norwitz went on, \"that doesn't necessarily mean one will develop a vitamin C deficiency or the associated medical condition, which is scurvy.\"",
      "When Norwitz himself did a six-month carnivore diet experiment and then tested his vitamin C levels, he found they were normal, even bordering on being high. He explains the science behind that result in the video.",
      "Myth No. 3: Lack of fiber will cause constipation",
      "While it is true that a majority of the nutrition a person consumes on a carnivore diet will be absorbed in the small intestine, leading to an overall decline in fecal mass, \"you will still poop,\" Norwitz said in the video.",
      "\"Some studies suggest that fiber elimination can actually help manage the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation,\" he added.",
      "Norwitz (left) noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz/iStock)",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean fiber is bad or that long-term zero-fiber diets wouldn't have negative consequences on the microbiome, he noted.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse,\" he said. \"There are many, like me, who feel better on low- or no-fiber diets, so it's a legitimate individual choice.\"",
      "Myth No. 4: The carnivore diet will harm athletic performance",
      "Norwitz disputes this claim, noting that as the body adapts to carbohydrate restriction, the capacity to burn fat increases.",
      "\"A new study of Iron Man athletes has debunked the idea that the body needs a high intake of carbohydrates during intense exercise to maintain peak performance,\" he said.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse.\"",
      "Norwitz goes into greater detail about the association between diet and athletic performance in his video, as does another doctor.",
      "Myth No. 5: The diet will lead to heart attacks",
      "While Norwitz acknowledges that a diet rich in red meat and saturated fat can increase LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and its associated marker (ApoB), which is a risk factor for heart disease, the extent to which a carnivore diet affects those levels is \"highly individual.\"",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"Some people even see LDL cholesterol and ApoB decrease, and many don't see any change,\" he says in the video.",
      "There are many risk factors for heart disease beyond cholesterol, Norwitz noted. These include visceral fat, insulin resistance, inflammation triglycerides and HDL, all of which could actually be improved on very low-carbohydrate diets.",
      "'I WENT ON A VEGAN DIET AND MY CHOLESTEROL WENT UP \u2014 HERE'S WHY'",
      "\"So a carnivore diet does not implicitly increase heart disease risk \u2014 but the bottom line here is that different people respond differently,\" he said.",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"",
      "Myth No. 6: The carnivore diet is an eating disorder",
      "Eating disorders are defined as \"restrictive eating patterns that impair physical or mental health,\" Norwitz noted.",
      "\"So if a person cures or goes into remission from a debilitating chronic disease \u2014 be that obesity, diabetes, depression, schizophrenia, inflammatory bowel disease \u2014 using a carnivore diet, then the diet clearly had a positive impact on physical or mental health and is not an eating disorder by definition.\"",
      "Overall, the researcher said, while a carnivore diet may be beneficial for some, it\u2019s not necessarily the best choice for everyone \u2014 \"and it doesn't mean that fiber or fruit is bad, or that someone else can't succeed on a plant-based or even a vegan diet.\" (Nick Norwitz)",
      "Instead, Norwitz said it should be considered an \"adaptive eating pattern.\"",
      "\"Not eating normally is not an eating disorder \u2014 in fact, I'd say standard American diet eating patterns could themselves reflect a form of eating disorder,\" he said.",
      "Myth No. 7: A meat-heavy diet is bad for the brain",
      "Following recent research that suggests red meat intake is linked to dementia, Norwitz said this data is \"misleading.\"",
      "The study in question lumped together different types of food, he noted, adding that there was \"tremendous healthy user bias.\"",
      "\"I do feel the carnivore diet is misunderstood, and that red meat and animal-based foods often get unfairly scapegoated.\"",
      "\"Participants who consumed more red meat had a higher prevalence of current smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes, and lower levels of dietary quality education, socioeconomic status and physical activity,\" Norwitz says in the video.",
      "Actually, he adds, \"unprocessed red meat intake was not linked to dementia or cognitive decline \u2014 just processed red meat intake, but this was somewhat overlooked in the study itself.\"",
      "Myth No. 8: The carnivore diet is for everyone",
      "Overall, the researcher said, while a carnivore diet may be beneficial for some, it\u2019s not necessarily the best choice for everyone \u2014 \"and it doesn't mean that fiber or fruit is bad, or that someone else can't succeed on a plant-based or even a vegan diet.\"",
      "The diet warrants \"further scientific exploration,\" Norwitz said.",
      "There is no \"one size fits all\" dietary solution, Norwitz said, although he noted the carnivore diet is \"misunderstood\" and \"unfairly scapegoated.\" (iStock)",
      "There is no \"one size fits all\" dietary solution, Norwitz said, adding that \"context and nuance are essential.\"",
      "\"However, I do feel the carnivore diet is misunderstood, and that red meat and animal-based foods often get unfairly scapegoated and thrown under the \u2018big food bus.\u2019\"",
      "Doctors give insight into the carnivore diet",
      "Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News' senior medical analyst, shared thoughts on the carnivore diet with Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The advantage is that meat is a high-packed source of calories from fat and a lot of protein, so it can help you lose weight,\" he said. \"But I think it is unhealthy. Too many saturated animal fats are bad for the heart and the diet is high in cholesterol.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Siegel instead recommends opting for the Mediterranean diet, which is heavy in vegetables, nuts and olive oil. \"With its unsaturated fats and antioxidants, it is much healthier,\" he said.",
      "Dr. Georgia Ede, a Harvard-trained, board-certified psychiatrist specializing in nutritional and metabolic psychiatry, said she has found carnivore diets to be \"indispensable tools\" in her clinical practice.",
      "The diet could potentially help identify food sensitivities, resolve chronic constipation and IBS symptoms, quiet food addiction and binge-eating, and break weight loss plateaus, according to Ede.",
      "\"Meat, seafood, poultry and eggs are the safest, healthiest, most nutritious foods we can eat,\" one doctor told Fox News Digital. (iStock)",
      "\"The hypothesis that meat is dangerous to human health has driven a long and passionate hunt for evidence against meat that has thus far come up empty-handed,\" the doctor, who is also the author of \"Change Your Diet, Change Your Mind,\" told Fox News Digital.",
      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0www.foxnews.com/health",
      "\"In my research, I have yet to find a credible, plausible health argument against including meat of any kind, red or otherwise, in the human diet,\" she went on.",
      "\"Meat, seafood, poultry and eggs are the safest, healthiest, most nutritious foods we can eat.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s not possible to say with scientific certainty whether this dietary pattern \u2026 is ideal for everyone.\"",
      "Ede added, \"It\u2019s not possible to say with scientific certainty whether this dietary pattern (or any dietary pattern, for that matter) is ideal for everyone, but my clinical and personal experience tell me that a well-formulated carnivore diet can be uniquely healing for some of us.\"",

      "The doctor did acknowledge that adhering to carnivore diets poses potential challenges.",
      "\"These include the potential for boredom that can come from the relative lack of variety, the social challenges of eating in a way that may make others feel uncomfortable, and the logistical challenges of finding meat, seafood, poultry, and/or egg dishes prepared simply enough to be suitable for the diet, especially when traveling or eating at others\u2019 homes,\" she told Fox News Digital.",

People were also recommended to record such searches and how to differentiate between different warrants ICE agents are likely to carry.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez did not take part in the webinar but did upload tips to Instagram \u2014 via posters in both English and Spanish \u2014 and called on her followers to share the posters widely and study them.\u00a0She also called on her followers to print out the posters and \"tape them up in your workplace or keep them by your door.\"",

He now runs a national association that oversees all Medical Doctorate-granting schools in the country, and about 500 academic health systems teaching hospitals.

      "\"In some cases, more than one agency will develop regulations, and the researchers have to answer to all of those different agency regulations. We should be able to harmonize those things and come out with a more thoughtful approach to reducing some of the regulatory burden,\" Skorton said.

      "In fiscal year 2023, the NIH spent around $35 billion across roughly 50,000 grants that went to research institutions, such as universities and hospitals. Of that $35 billion, according to the Trump administration, $9 billion was allocated for \"indirect costs\" that cover expenses related to depreciation on buildings, equipment, capital improvements, interest on debt associated with certain buildings, and operations and maintenance expenses.

      "Fox News Digital spoke to medical experts who have supported Trump's blanket cut to administrative and facilities costs, and they argue that reducing this price burden on the federal government will increase the availability of new research grants, while getting rid of financial bloat that universities have been able to take advantage of at the taxpayers' expense.",

      "Trump \"will have some of the nation\u2019s finest attorneys defending his executive orders and initiatives, and the Democrats will waste millions of dollars losing in court,\" Yoo, the former deputy assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, told Fox News Digital on Tuesday when asked whether there are efforts of \"lawfare\" against Trump in his second administration.",
      "\"I expect that Trump will ultimately prevail on two-thirds or more of his executive orders, but the Democrats may succeed in delaying them for about a year or so,\" Yoo said.",
      "The Trump administration has been hit by at least 54 lawsuits in response to Trump\u2019s executive orders and actions since his inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump has signed at least 63 executive orders just roughly three weeks into his administration, including 26 on his first day alone.",
      "The executive orders and actions are part of Trump\u2019s shift of the federal government to fall in line with his \"America First\" policies, including snuffing out government overspending and mismanagement through the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), banning biological men from competing in women\u2019s sports and deporting thousands of illegal immigrants who flooded the nation during the Biden administration.",

      "A handful of Democratic state attorneys general and other local leaders vowed following Trump's election win to set off a new resistance to his agenda, vowing to battle him in the courts over policies they viewed as harmful to constituents. Upon his inauguration and his policies taking effect, Democrats have amplified their rhetoric to battle Trump in the courts, and also to take the fight to \"the streets.\"",

      "'PLAYING WITH THE COURTS': TRUMP ADMIN HIT WITH DOZENS OF SUITS AFTER YEARS OF PRESIDENT CONDEMNING 'LAWFARE'",
      "The dozens of cases come after Trump faced four criminal indictments, on both the state and federal level, in the interim of his first and second administrations. Trump had railed against the cases \u2014 including the Manhattan trial and conviction, the Georgia election racketeering case, and former special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s\u00a0election case and classified documents case \u2014 as examples of the Democratic Party waging \"lawfare\" against him in an effort to hurt his re-election chances in the 2024 cycle.",

      "\"I think that what is going on now is different than lawfare,\" he said. \"I think of lawfare as the deliberate use by the party in power to prosecute its political opponents to affect election outcomes. The Democrats at the federal and state level brought charges against Trump to drive him out of the 2024 elections.\"",
      "\"The lawsuits against Trump now are the usual thrust and parry of the separation of powers,\" Yoo explained. \"The Democrats are not attacking Trump personally and there is no election. Instead, they are suing Trump as President to stop his official policies.",
      "LAWSUIT TRACKER: NEW RESISTANCE BATTLING TRUMP'S SECOND TERM THROUGH ONSLAUGHT OF LAWSUITS TAKING AIM AT EOS",

And we will again, as the president said very clearly yesterday, comply with these orders. But it is the administration's position that we will ultimately be vindicated, and the president's executive actions that he took were completely within the law,\" Leavitt said, before citing the \"weaponization\" of the court systems against Trump while he was on the campaign trail.",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson walks you through the process.",
      "Every tech expert will tell you the App Store is safer than Google Play Store. Some might even claim it is impossible to download a malicious app from the App Store, but they are wrong.",
      "While I admit the App Store is a secure and tightly controlled ecosystem, it cannot completely shield you. Security researchers have found that hackers are targeting several apps on the App Store to spread malware that steals information from screenshots saved on a device.",
      "The issue also affects those downloading apps from the Google Play Store.",

      "A person holding an iPhone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson\u00a0)",
      "How the malware works and what makes it different",
      "According to\u00a0researchers at Kaspersky, this malware campaign is more advanced than typical info stealers, both in how it works and how it spreads. Instead of relying on social engineering tricks to get users to grant permissions like most banking trojans or spyware, this malware hides inside seemingly legitimate apps and slips past Apple and Google\u2019s security checks.",
      "One of its standout features is Optical Character Recognition. Instead of stealing stored files, it scans screenshots saved on the device, extracts text and sends the information to remote servers.",
      "Once installed, the malware operates stealthily, often activating only after a period of dormancy to avoid raising suspicion. It employs encrypted communication channels to send stolen data back to its operators, making it difficult to trace. Plus, it spreads through deceptive updates or hidden code within app dependencies, an approach that helps it evade initial security screenings by app store review teams.",
      "The infection vectors vary between Apple and Google\u2019s ecosystems. On iOS, the malware is often embedded within apps that initially pass Apple\u2019s rigorous review process but later introduce harmful functionality through updates. On Android, the malware can exploit sideloading options, but even official Google Play apps have been found to carry these malicious payloads, sometimes hidden within SDKs (software development kits) supplied by third-party developers.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "What's being stolen, and who's responsible?",
      "The scope of stolen information is alarming. This malware primarily targets crypto wallet recovery phrases but is also capable of exfiltrating login credentials, payment details, personal messages, location data and even biometric identifiers. Some versions are designed to harvest authentication tokens, allowing attackers to access accounts even if users change their passwords.",
      "The apps serving as malware carriers include ComeCome, ChatAi, WeTink, AnyGPT and more. These range from productivity tools to entertainment and utility apps. In some cases, malicious developers create these apps with full knowledge of the malware\u2019s purpose. In others, the issue appears to be a supply chain vulnerability, where legitimate developers unknowingly integrate compromised SDKs or third-party services that introduce malicious code into their applications.",
      "We reached out to Apple for a comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims. (Kaspersky)",
      "Apple's response to screenshot-scanning malware discovered in App Store",
      "Apple has removed the 11 iOS apps mentioned in Kaspersky's report from the App Store. Furthermore, they discovered that these 11 apps shared code signatures with 89 other iOS apps, all of which had been previously rejected or removed for violating Apple's policies, resulting in the termination of their developer accounts.",
      "Apps requesting access to user data such as Photos, Camera or Location must provide relevant functionality or face rejection. They must also clearly explain their data usage when prompting users for permission. iOS privacy features ensure users always control whether their location information is shared with an app. Also, starting in iOS 14, the PhotoKit API \u2014 which allows apps to request access to a user\u2019s Photos library \u2014 added additional controls to let users select only specific photos or videos to share with an app instead of providing access to their entire library.",
      "The App Store Review Guidelines mandate that developers are responsible for ensuring their entire app, including ad networks, analytics services and third-party SDKs, complies with the guidelines. Developers must carefully review and choose these components. Apps must also accurately represent their privacy practices, including those of the SDKs they use, in their privacy labels.",
      "In 2023, the App Store rejected over 1.7 million app submissions for failing to meet its stringent privacy, security and content standards. It also rejected 248,000 app submissions found to be spam, copycats or misleading and prevented 84,000 potentially fraudulent apps from reaching users.",

Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Installing strong antivirus software can add an extra layer of protection by scanning apps for malware, blocking suspicious activity and alerting you to potential threats.

      "2. Stick to trusted developers and well-known apps:\u00a0Even though malware has been found in official app stores, users can still minimize their risk by downloading apps from reputable developers with a long track record. Before installing an app, check its developer history, read multiple reviews and look at the permissions it requests. If an app from an unknown developer suddenly gains popularity but lacks a strong review history, approach it with caution.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully:\u00a0Many malicious apps disguise themselves as legitimate tools but request excessive permissions that go beyond their stated purpose. For example, a simple calculator app should not need access to your contacts, messages or location. If an app asks for permissions that seem unnecessary, consider it a red flag and either deny those permissions or avoid installing the app altogether. Go to your phone settings and check app permissions on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android.",
      "4. Keep your device and apps updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software to distribute malware. Always\u00a0keep your operating system and apps updated to the latest versions, as these updates often contain critical security patches. Enabling automatic updates ensures that you stay protected without having to manually check for new versions.",
      "5. Be wary of apps that promise too much:\u00a0Many malware-infected apps lure users by offering features that seem too good to be true \u2014 such as free premium services, extreme battery optimizations or AI-powered functionality that appears unrealistic. If an app\u2019s claims sound exaggerated or its download numbers skyrocket overnight with questionable reviews, it\u2019s best to avoid it. Stick to apps with a transparent development team and verifiable functionalities.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The new malware campaign highlights the need for stricter vetting processes, continuous monitoring of app behavior post-approval and greater transparency from app stores regarding security risks. While Apple and Google have removed the malicious apps upon detection, the fact that they made it onto the platform in the first place exposes a gap in the existing security framework. As cybercriminals refine their methods, app stores must evolve just as quickly or risk losing the trust of the very users they claim to protect.",

    "story": [
      "SpaceX's Starship exploded during an unmanned test flight. Debris from the explosion streaked through the sky, leaving people on the ground amazed and confused. (Greg Munch /TMX)",
      "The European Space Agency (ESA) said Monday that its Euclid space telescope has detected a rare bright halo of light around a nearby galaxy.",
      "Known as an Einstein ring, the halo was captured in photos encircling a galaxy nearly 590 million light-years away, which is considered close by cosmic standards. A single light-year is measured at 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "While astronomers have known about the galaxy where the phenomenon was captured for over a century, they were surprised when Euclid revealed the bright glowing ring,",
      "Euclid blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida on July 1, 2023, to begin a six-year mission to explore the dark universe.",
      "GIANT STELLAR NURSERY REVEALED IN NEW IMAGES FROM ESA'S SPACE TELESCOPE",
      "A sea of colorful stars and galaxies appear to swim in the vast blackness of space around a hazy halo at center stage. In the middle of the image, the fuzzy-looking bulb of light in a warm shade of yellow extends around a small bright spot, nestled within a thin light circle that appears to be drawn closely around it. (ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "But before the space telescope could begin its survey of the universe, scientists had to ensure everything onboard was working properly. During the early phase of testing, which took place in September 2023, Euclid sent images back to Earth.",
      "The ESA said the images were deliberately out of focus, but in one of the images, Euclid Archive Scientist Bruno Altieri saw what he believed was a very special phenomenon and decided to look at it a bit closer.",
      "\"I look at the data from Euclid as it comes in,\" Bruno said in a press release from the ESA. \"Even from that first observation, I could see it, but after Euclid made more observations of the area, we could see a perfect Einstein ring. For me, with a lifelong interest in gravitational lensing, that was amazing.\"",
      "For most of the population out there, an Einstein Ring is an \"extremely rare phenomenon,\" the ESA said.",
      "POWERFUL WEBB TELESCOPE SPIES SPECTACULAR STAR BIRTH CLUSTER BEYOND THE MILKY WAY",
      "A thin ring of a perfect circular shape and a piercingly bright white disc in its middle are the protagonists of this image. They stand out against a uniformly colored background of a hazy dark gray. (ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "When a distant galaxy is observed through a telescope, the light from that galaxy may encounter another galaxy on its way to the telescope. When that happens, the foreground galaxy acts like a magnifying glass, and gravity causes the traveling light rays to bend. When light rays bend, scientists call that gravitational lensing, according to the ESA.",
      "When the background galaxy, lensing galaxy and telescope are in perfect alignment, the image appears as a ring, also known as an Einstein Ring.",
      "The galaxy, called NGC 6506, is about 590 million light-years away, and this is the first time the ring of light around its center has ever been detected.",
      "\"All strong lenses are special, because they're so rare, and they're incredibly useful scientifically,\" Conor O\u2019Riordan of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics said. \"This one is particularly special, because it\u2019s so close to Earth and the alignment makes it very beautiful.\"",
      "POWERFUL WEBB TELESCOPE CAPTURES PHOTOS OF ONE OF THE EARLIEST SUPERNOVA EVER SEEN",
      "The text paragraph explains the principle behind the Einstein rings. (ESA)",
      "Einstein rings are based on physicist Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, which predicts that light will bend around objects in space, so they focus the light like giant lenses, ESA said. The phenomenon allows scientists to sometimes see the light from distant galaxies that would otherwise be hidden.",
      "\"I find it very intriguing that this ring was observed within a well-known galaxy, which was first discovered in 1884,\" Valeria Pettorino, ESA Euclid project scientist, said. \"The galaxy has been known to astronomers for a very long time. And yet this ring was never observed before. This demonstrates how powerful Euclid is, finding new things even in places we thought we knew well. This discovery is very encouraging for the future of the Euclid mission and demonstrates its fantastic capabilities.\"",
      "Over the course of the mission, scientists expect Euclid will reveal more about the role of gravity in the Universe, as well as the nature of dark energy and dark matter.",

      "Euclid will map over a third of the sky and observe billions of galaxies as far as 10 billion light-years away, ESA said. In doing so, scientists expect Euclid to find around 100,000 more strong lenses, though finding one so cosmically close to home and so spectacular, ESA added, \"is astonishing.\"",

From customer support scams to impersonation and phishing attacks, the company\u2019s services are constantly under threat. Recently, even Russia-sponsored hackers managed to breach Microsoft and steal sensitive information.",
      "While Microsoft services as a whole are prime targets, one that stands out is Teams. The collaboration tool is used by more than 300 million people worldwide, making it a goldmine for attackers. Hackers are using it to spread\u00a0phishing,\u00a0vishing and\u00a0quishing campaigns, relying on social engineering tactics to trick victims into sharing private and sensitive data.",

      "Hackers also insert malware-laden files into chat threads, tricking users into downloading DLL files that enable system takeover. Phishing campaigns leverage compromised accounts or domains to send deceptive invitations, luring victims into downloading harmful files.",
      "Some attackers use email bombing and vishing, posing as tech support to overwhelm users with spam emails before tricking them into granting remote access. Compromised email addresses and stolen Microsoft 365 credentials provide another entry point for unauthorized access.",
      "Plus, external access settings in Microsoft Teams, which often allow outside users to initiate chats or meetings, can be exploited if not properly restricted. Another common tactic is sending phishing links through Teams chats, often disguised as invoices or payment notifications, leading to ransomware infections.",

      "It usually starts with an email about a job followed by a suggestion to do the interview over Teams. The first red flag is that the entire interview happens over chat with no video and no call. After that, you are \"hired\" and asked to submit your details, often through a Google Doc requesting personal info like your social security or tax number. Some victims are even asked to buy equipment for the job, pay a hiring fee or purchase gift cards, which are classic signs that the whole thing is a scam.",

      "1) Avoid opening suspicious links and attachments: Be cautious of unsolicited links or attachments, especially in chat messages or emails. Cybercriminals often use these to deliver malware or phishing links. Never click on links that seem unusual or come from unknown sources.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Check for red flags in job offers: If you receive a job offer that seems too good to be true or involves an interview conducted entirely via chat with no phone call or video meeting, it's likely a scam. Legitimate companies typically conduct interviews using multiple forms of communication.",
      "A job offer that insists on only text-based conversations is a major red flag. Other warning signs include being asked to provide personal information through Google Docs, being asked to pay for equipment, paying fees to secure the job or purchasing gift cards as part of the hiring process.",
      "3) Use strong, unique passwords: Ensure your Microsoft 365 and other accounts are protected with strong passwords. Consider using\u00a0two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. Also, you might want to use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive personal details, like social security numbers or tax information, through unsecured or unsolicited channels, such as Google Docs or messages on Teams. Always verify the legitimacy of such requests.",
      "5) Report suspicious activity: If you notice any suspicious activity on your Microsoft Teams account or receive unusual job offers, report it immediately. Prompt action can prevent a potential breach or further compromise. Notify your IT department or relevant authorities so they can investigate and take appropriate measures.",
      "6) Verify IT support requests: Be cautious of unsolicited messages or calls claiming to be from IT support, especially those asking you to install software or grant remote access. Cybercriminals often impersonate IT staff to deploy ransomware or steal sensitive data. Always verify such requests with your actual IT department before taking any action. If in doubt, contact your IT team directly using official channels, not through the message or call you received.",

      "Scammers and hackers are not slowing down, so staying sharp is the only way to stay ahead. If something feels off, like a job that sounds too good to be true, a random Teams message with a sketchy link or an interview that is just a chat, trust your instincts. You should always be careful with external messages and invites that you to receive on Microsoft Teams. Even if it seems like it is from someone you know, it is best to double-check, especially if it involves a file, a link or an invitation to a chat you were not expecting to receive.",

      "If something is free, you\u2019re the product being sold. This is especially true for most online services we use. For example, Google\u2019s primary source of revenue is ads. They make money by collecting data about you and me and selling targeted advertising to companies, which then show us products relevant to our interests.",
      "You might have noticed that the moment you search for a product on Google, you start seeing ads for it on Facebook. The same applies to apps like Instagram, Threads and LinkedIn. In fact, research shows that the apps collecting the most data about you are also among the most widely used.",

      "The most invasive apps you\u2019re probably using",
      "Apps collect all sorts of data about you, but let\u2019s get one thing straight. Not all data collection is bad. Some apps genuinely need access to certain information to function properly. For example, Uber stores your location data to help you find a ride faster, while WhatsApp requires access to your contacts so you can send messages.",
      "The real issue is data collection that serves no purpose other than showing you ads or selling your information to third parties. According to Marin Marin\u010di\u0107, head of IT Infrastructure at\u00a0Nsoft, the top 20 most invasive apps collect data that is not necessary for their core functions.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Leading the list is Meta with all four of its major apps. Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Threads share 68% of collected data with third parties while also using it for targeted ads. LinkedIn follows, sharing around 37% of user data, with Amazon in third place, followed by YouTube.",
      "What makes this concerning is how deeply embedded these apps are in our daily lives, making it nearly impossible to find alternatives or avoid data collection altogether.",
      "The list also includes Elon Musk\u2019s X at No. 5, followed by Uber Eats, PayPal, Uber, Google and Amazon Prime Video. TikTok, despite ongoing scrutiny over its data policies, ranks 14th. While many of these names were expected, one surprising entry is the mobile game Candy Crush, which uses 28% of collected data for ads. You can find the full list in the image below.",

      "5 ways to reduce data sharing",
      "If you\u2019re not able to delete the apps listed above, follow the simple steps below to minimize how much information is being collected and shared.",
      "1. Review app permissions:\u00a0Most apps request access to data they do not actually need. Go to your phone settings and check app permissions on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android. Disable access to location, microphone, contacts and other sensitive data unless absolutely necessary.",
      "2. Turn off ad personalization:\u00a0Many companies track your online activity to show targeted ads. You can limit this by disabling ad personalization in\u00a0Google,\u00a0Facebook, and other accounts. This reduces the amount of data collected about your interests and behavior.",
      "3. Limit social media tracking:\u00a0Social media platforms track your activity even when you are not using them.\u00a0Adjust privacy settings to restrict data collection.",
      "4. Avoid signing in with Google or Facebook:\u00a0Many websites offer login options using Google or Facebook. While convenient, this shares even more data with these platforms. Instead, create separate accounts using email whenever possible.",
      "5. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and private browsing mode:\u00a0A\u00a0VPN hides your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity, making it harder for websites to track you. Combined with private browsing or incognito mode, this reduces the amount of data companies can collect about your online activity. Using a VPN service can also enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi.",
      "While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The best way to reduce companies from collecting your data is to remove invasive apps from your phone. Many apps request unnecessary permissions that can track your activity, so deleting them limits exposure. Instead of downloading standalone apps, try using the browser versions of popular social media platforms, as they typically have fewer permissions.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "However, web tracking still exists through cookies and fingerprinting, so using a\u00a0privacy-focused browser like Brave, Firefox with enhanced tracking protection, or Safari with Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) can further reduce data collection. However, some apps are so deeply integrated that replacing them is difficult. For example, if you use an Android phone, avoiding Google\u2019s ecosystem is nearly impossible. Apple, on the other hand, offers more privacy controls, giving users better options to limit data collection.",

However, Neuer disputes Palestinians\u2019 refugee status and says that President Trump\u2019s proposed Gaza takeover uncovered a \"truth that has been hidden.\"",
      "Neuer points out that UNRWA supporters and critics of the president\u2019s proposal have accused Trump of \"uprooting them [Palestinians] from their homes and lands,\" which would mean that \"they\u2019re not refugees.\" Gaza, which the U.N. recognizes as part of the \"State of Palestine,\" would be considered their home under this criticism, negating their refugee status.",
      "However, the problems with UNRWA go beyond ambiguous definitions. Neuer told Fox News Digital that the agency \"systematically employed individuals who were supporting terrorism.\" He pointed to Fathi al-Sharif, who served as the principal of a school run by UNRWA, as well as the agency\u2019s teachers\u2019 union in Lebanon.",
      "\"We know that the head of UNRWA's education system, namely, teacher, school principal and head of the teachers\u2019 union of 2,000 teachers in Lebanon, was a man named Fathi al-Sharif\u2026 he was the head of Hamas in Lebanon,\" Neuer said, adding that American taxpayers\u2019 money funded al-Sharif and \"the entire education system that he oversaw.\"",
      "In the case of Suhail al-Hindi, UNRWA\u2019s former head of a \"local staff union in Gaza,\" the agency insists that it suspended and fired al-Hindi after an announcement that he had been \"elected to political office with Hamas.\"",
      "In response to a request for comment, UNRWA told Fox News Digital that it \"prohibits any type of involvement of staff in a militant or armed group.

      "U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols questioned how employees were being irreparably harmed and why their claims couldn\u2019t be handled through normal avenues for federal employees to bring employment-related claims.",
      "\"The claim plaintiffs have here is this agency is being dismantled in an unconstitutional and unlawful manner in excess of the executive\u2019s authority,\" said Karla Gilbride, a lawyer for the unions suing the agency. Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton insisted the agency isn't being dismantled and called the union's arguments \"a straw man.\"",
      "Nichols pressed Hamilton for what steps the government was taking to ensure the safety of workers overseas, and directed him to submit information in writing about what actions were being taken. The judge extended his temporary restraining order for another week while he weighs how to proceed with the union's request for a longer injunction.",
      "A DOGE Day Afternoon",
      "Musk\u2019s newly created DOGE was the subject of three hearings in two different courthouses Friday afternoon.",
      "One of the hearings was in federal court in Manhattan, where U.S. District Judge Jeanette Vargas extended a restraining order barring DOGE staffers from accessing sensitive personal data on Treasury department servers.",
      "The plaintiffs in the case, a coalition of states, are seeking a longer term preliminary injunction restricting DOGE\u2019s access. \u201cI am going to reserve decision on the preliminary injunction decision. I will have it soon,\u201d the judge said.",
      "A judge in D.C. heard similar arguments involving DOGE\u2019s access to Dept. of Education records and made a similar ruling. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss left in place an order restricting DOGE from accessing sensitive information systems until at least Monday, when he said he expects to issue a decision on the issue.",
      "The other case was also in D.C., where U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who presided over Trump\u2019s election interference prosecution, heard arguments from a coalition of states seeking an order declaring that DOGE is unlawful. The states want an order essentially barring the \"unconstitutional\" office from taking any further disruptive action.",
      "Chutkan expressed deep skepticism that the states had shown the imminent and irreparable harm that would warrant an order stopping all of DOGE's work. \u201cWhat you\u2019re essentially asking me to do is temporarily halt the functioning of the government,\u201d the judge said.",
      "Although she appeared disinclined to grant the restraining order, Chutkan asked the states to file a more limited proposed order for her consideration by 5 p.m. Saturday.",
      "Temporary reprieve for CFPB",
      "A different D.C. judge's ruling late Friday gave a temporary reprieve to the embattled Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson's ruling bars mass firings at the agency and prevents the deletion of agency data pending a March 3 hearing on groups' claims that acting CFPB director Russell Vought was working to essentially shut the agency down.",
      "The actions taken by Vought and the Trump-run CFPB were \"arbitrary, capricious, unconstitutional, and not in accordance with law,\" the unions said in a court filing.",
      "They had asked the judge to \u201cdeclare unlawful and set aside the defendants\u2019 actions and intended further actions to dismantle the CFPB.\u201d",
      "The judge's decision noted the two sides had agreed to the pause, which she made official in her order.",
      "Judge says Trump administration defying court order",
      "On Monday, a federal judge in Rhode Island said that the Trump administration had violated his order\u00a0halting a sweeping federal funding freeze.",
      "U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell ordered the government to \u201cimmediately restore frozen funding\u201d after the plaintiffs in the case, a coalition of 22 states, said the government had failed to resume funding in several programs.",
      "It was the first time since Trump\u2019s second inauguration that a judge has accused his administration of defying a court order.",
      "McConnell issued his restraining order Jan. 31 after\u00a0a wide-ranging\u00a0Office of Management and Budget directive promoting Trump's executive orders caused chaos and confusion\u00a0across the country, with payment systems being temporarily shut down.",
      "Foreign aid freeze temporarily halted",
      "A federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Thursday signed off on a temporary restraining order blocking the administration's blanket freeze on\u00a0federal grant money to perform foreign assistance work.",
      "Businesses and nonprofits that received the grants and disbursed the aid filed suit and provided \"evidence detailing the devastating effects on American businesses and nonprofits, which have been forced to shut down programs, to furlough or lay off employees and in some instances to shutter altogether as a result of the challenged action,\" U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali wrote.",
      "\"They have also provided supporting evidence that Defendants\u2019 actions have had and will continue to have a catastrophic effect on the humanitarian missions of several plaintiffs,\" the judge added.",
      "The government countered \"that some of the contracts terminated might have included clauses that allowed them to be terminated in certain circumstances, but also acknowledged that the approach taken was blanket and not limited to such contracts.\" The judge found the groups had \"met their burden for temporary, emergency relief.\"",
      "Judge halts NIH\u00a0cuts",
      "On Monday, a federal judge in Boston temporarily halted the Trump administration\u2019s drastic changes to how and how much the National Institutes of Health pays for biomedical research.",
      "The NIH announced last week it would limit indirect funding for research projects to 15%, slashing how much funding the federal government would provide to research agencies for things like equipment, maintenance, utilities and support staff. The unexpected immediate cuts were met with some bipartisan backlash across the country, and a group of 22 states with Democratic attorneys general challenged them in court, arguing the administration didn't have the authority to make such cuts.",
      "U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley signed off on a temporary restraining order blocking the cuts. Unlike in other actions that have been brought to date resulting in nationwide freezes, Kelley's order only affects the 22 states that brought the suit. The judge is scheduled to hold a hearing in the case on Feb. 21.",
      "Judge orders administration to restore scrubbed health data",
      "U.S. District Judge John D. Bates of Washington, D.C., ordered the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Food and Drug Administration to restore health-related webpages and datasets that had been taken down in an effort to comply with Trump\u2019s executive order cracking down on \u201cgender ideology.\u201d",
      "The information that was removed included a number of\u00a0pages about HIV prevention\u00a0and\u00a0emergency contraception, information about transgender people and gay and bisexual men and suggestions on how to develop clinical trials.",
      "The nonprofit Doctors for America filed suit to get the pages restored, arguing its members \u201cuse\u00a0the webpages regularly in treating patients and conducting research.\u201d Bates granted their request for a temporary restraining order, finding, \u201cIf those doctors cannot provide these individuals the care they need (and deserve) within the scheduled and often limited time frame, there is a chance that some individuals will not receive treatment, including for severe, life-threatening conditions.\u201d",
      "Transgender health care ban frozen",
      "On Thursday, a federal judge in Maryland temporarily blocked for at least two weeks Trump\u2019s executive order aimed at restricting transgender health care for anyone under 19.",
      "A suit brought on behalf of two transgender young adults who are 18 and five families of trans minors argued the order, which threatened to cut off federal funding for hospitals and health care providers who perform transition-related care for minors, is unlawful. After the order was issued,\u00a0hospitals in\u00a0New York City; Colorado; Virginia; Illinois; Pennsylvania;\u00a0Washington, D.C.; and Los Angeles announced that they were suspending or reviewing their transition-related care for people under 19.",
      "The suit charges that Trump can't make the financial determinations \u2014 only Congress can. The government argued Thursday that the order is not a nationwide ban on care and is only a \u201cgeneral policy directive.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can credibly argue that this is not demanding the cessation of funding for gender-affirming care,\u201d the judge responded. \u201cIn this situation, it is clear that these plaintiffs have received phone calls stopping their care, stopping their appointments, stopping their everything.\u201d",
      "Another loss for birthright citizenship",
      "At a hearing Monday, a federal judge in New Hampshire became the third to block Trump's executive order restricting birthright citizenship.",
      "U.S. District Judge Joseph N. Laplante said he would issue a preliminary injunction blocking the order from taking effect. The order, which is being challenged in at least nine lawsuits, attempts to limit birthright citizenship to people who have at least one parent who is a United States citizen or permanent resident.",
      "Judges in Seattle and Maryland had previously blocked the directive, finding it violates the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which says, \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d",
      "More challenges on the way",
      "The administration was also hit with several new lawsuits this week challenging Trump's directives.",
      "Musk's DOGE has been the target of numerous suits, including the one filed Thursday on behalf of 14 states seeking to have it declared unlawful.",
      "On Tuesday, a group of Christian and Jewish religious organizations filed suit in federal court in Washington, D.C., challenging the Department of Homeland Security's decision to rescind guidance barring immigration raids at or near places of worship except in emergency situations or with prior written, high-level supervisory approval.",
      "On Wednesday, a coalition of immigrant rights groups filed suit in Washington, D.C., district court over the administration's policy of sending immigrants from the interior of the United States to Guantanamo Bay. The suit charges the immigrants are being denied their right to a lawyer."

      "Her words \u2014 which will be featured in her upcoming book, \u201cDeep in My Feels\u201d \u2014 have inspired a trend on TikTok, where people are posting their own versions of what they think would happen if they caught up with their past selves.",
      "There are 16 million posts that appear under the \u201cCoffee with My Younger Self\u201d page on TikTok as of Friday, with many users sharing videos with text that begins \u201cI met my younger self for coffee.\u201d The posts often use a clip of the song \u201cSweet Heat Lightning\u201d by Gregory Alan Isakov.",
      "For Cecelia, writing the poem was a way for her to embody \u201cmy present self meeting back up with my past self and be the person for her that she didn\u2019t have at that time.\u201d She said she has been pleasantly surprised that others are now using her poetry as a way to heal and reflect on their own memories.",
      "\u201cSome people have chosen to go the really, really deep route of talking about healing with their past self, and some people have kind of made it more lighthearted,\u201d Cecelia said. \u201cSo it\u2019s just been really fun to see just each direction that people have taken with it.\u201d",
      "The videos have garnered hundreds of thousands of views on TikTok \u2014 with even \u201cShark Tank\u201d judge and entrepreneur Barbara Corcoran getting in on the trend by sharing her journey from waitressing to becoming the \u201cQueen of New York Real Estate.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s easier to practice self-love when you\u2019re speaking to a child \u2014 in this case someone\u2019s internal child \u2014 than an adult,\u201d said Raza, who put a twist on the trend by reading her poem aloud rather than writing it as text over video. \u201cSo I think by doing this trend, people are able to give themselves that love in the form of seeing themselves as younger.\u201d",
      "Some who have posted videos said writing their own version of the \u201ccoffee poem\u201d has been a way to celebrate their accomplishments, large and small. Others said it has been a way for them to let go of past hopes and dreams.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s so easy to get caught up in the day to day of life, and then seeing a trend like that kind of forced me to step back and, like, reflect on how far I\u2019ve come,\u201d said Giselle Ortega, 23, who also participated in the trend.",
      "In her video, she recalls her younger self\u2019s coffee order (an iced mocha with two creams) versus her current order (an iced coffee with \u201cjust almond milk please\u201d).

      "\u201cThe court must protect victims, OF COURSE, while with the same ethical responsibility, the courts must protect the innocent from being accused without a shred of evidence,\u201d Carter said. \u201cMay the truth prevail for all victims and those falsely accused equally.\u201d"

Nothing like this has happened in our more than 15 years of providing this type of therapy. We do not know why or how this happened and will participate in all of the investigations that now need to take place.\u201d",

      "In recent years, spas, wellness centers and other unaccredited facilities have started promoting hyperbaric oxygen therapy as a treatment for a variety of health problems, and the FDA warns \u201csome claims of what it can do are unproven.\u201d The FDA does not list sleep apnea and ADHD among the conditions the therapy can treat, though there\u00a0are some anecdotal claims it may help with both conditions.",
      "Harrington described Thomas as a sweet child who loved his little brother, and he said Thomas\u2019 parents were hopeful he would benefit from the hyperbaric oxygen therapy services offered at the Oxford Center.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t some type of lifesaving measure that was absolutely needed. It was just a mother who was trying to help her son with some conditions that he had and was promised that with these conditions and this treatment, that they would be able to help,\u201d Harrington said. \u201cAnnie was trying to help her child as any parent would \u2014 as good parents do.\u201d",

      "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy works by having patients breathe in 100% pure oxygen as the air pressure inside the hyperbaric chamber is increased to assist in delivering the oxygen to the patient\u2019s lungs. Room air, by comparison, is only 21% oxygen.",

      "The Troy Fire Department said after Thomas\u2019 death that while the presence of that much oxygen in a pressurized environment can support combustion, \u201cour initial research shows that this type of incident is uncommon.\u201d",
      "But it is not without precedent: In 2009, a 4-year-old and his grandmother died after a fire ignited in a hyperbaric chamber at an unaccredited Florida clinic where the child was receiving treatment for cerebral palsy. Two staff members were charged in their deaths, one of whom was a doctor who did not serve jail time but lost his medical license.

      "That meant abortion facilities still had to be licensed by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Planned Parenthood argued that the licensing law required providers to give \u201cmedically unnecessary and invasive\u201d pelvic exams to anyone receiving an abortion, including medication abortions, according to court documents. It also included \u201cmedically irrelevant\u201d size requirements for hallways, rooms and doors.",

      "Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang said in her ruling that the licensing requirement is \u201cfacially discriminatory because it does not treat services provided in abortion facilities the same as other types of similarly situated health care, including miscarriage care.\u201d",
      "Voters\u00a0approved the measure\u00a0adding abortion rights to the constitution in November. That amendment did not legalize abortion in the state outright but instead required judges to reconsider laws that had almost completely banned the procedure.",
      "Planned Parenthood and other advocates sued to overturn Missouri\u2019s near-total abortion ban almost immediately after voters amended the constitution to protect reproductive rights. Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey is fighting the lawsuit.",
      "There was no immediate response to a voice message seeking comment from a spokesperson for the attorney general.",
      "Margot Riphagen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, said the group is working quickly to start providing the procedure again in the coming days.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision affirms what we\u2019ve already long known \u2014 the state\u2019s abortion facility licensing requirements were not about patient safety, but rather another politically motivated barrier to prevent patients seeking abortion from getting the care they need,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Missouri is one of\u00a0five states where voters approved ballot measures\u00a0in 2024 to enshrine abortion rights in their constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment but will need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect.",
      "Friday\u2019s ruling is a temporary order pending the outcome of the lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates.",
      "Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, said clinic partners are ready to start providing abortions as soon as next week.",
      "\u201cWith this change the landscape for Missourians and the entire Midwest region will be transformed, as patients will have greater access to abortion care than they have had in years,\u201d she said in a statement.",

      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. While there is no defined time frame, doctors say it is generally sometime after the\u00a021st week\u00a0of pregnancy.",
      "Missouri was among the first states to implement a prohibition on most abortions after a\u00a0U.S. Supreme Court ruling\u00a0in June 2022 overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision establishing a nationwide right to abortion."

      "James Harrington, managing partner of Fieger Law in Southfield, Michigan, said Thomas Cooper\u2019s parents had taken him to receive multiple sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for sleep apnea and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder at the Oxford Center, an alternative medicine facility in the Detroit suburb of Troy that says it treats over 100 conditions, such as autism, Alzheimer\u2019s, dyslexia and cancer. The Food and Drug Administration does not recognize hyperbaric oxygen therapy for those conditions.",
      "Thomas was killed on Jan. 31 in an incident that Troy police and fire officials have described as a fiery explosion in the chamber. Speaking for the first time about the case on Friday, Harrington said Thomas\u2019 mom, Annie Cooper, rushed to try to save her son when the fire started.",
      "\u201cShe has significant burns on her arm, and that was done during a rescue attempt to try to get her child out of the burning flames,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cShe was trying and trying to get him out, and was unsuccessful.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe does have visible burns,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the real problem for her is going to be the emotional trauma.\u201d",
      "The Oxford Center, which has two locations in Michigan, did not immediately return multiple requests for comment on Friday about the circumstances that led to Thomas\u2019 death. After the incident, it released a statement to other media outlets that read, \u201cThe safety and wellbeing of the children we serve is our highest priority.

      "\u201cThis is being promoted by the wellness community. They\u2019re saying, \u2018These are not medical chambers, we are using them for wellness, and wellness is not regulated by the FDA,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThis, in my opinion, is wrong.\u201d",
      "In an email to NBC News, the FDA said other agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Joint Commission and state medical licensing agencies, regulate the practice of medicine. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Joint Commission did not immediately comment on Friday, nor did the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.",
      "\u201cAs a general matter, if the FDA becomes aware of an incident involving a device failure or malfunction, the FDA follows appropriate processes to review and gather information on the incident to determine appropriate next steps, including but not limited to a device recall or a safety communication,\u201d it said.",
      "The FDA warns on its website that hyperbaric oxygen therapy devices \u201care not proven to cure cancer, Lyme disease, autism or Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d and it advises patients to check with their health care providers to see if hyperbaric oxygen therapy is right for them.",
      "The FDA also recommends going to a facility that has been evaluated and accredited by the Undersea & Hyperbaric Medical Society, which has a map of accredited facilities on its website. The Oxford Center is not listed among the accredited facilities.",
      "The Troy Fire Department said after Thomas\u2019 death that while the presence of that much oxygen in a pressurized environment can support combustion, \u201cour initial research shows that this type of incident is uncommon.\u201d",
      "But it is not without precedent: In 2009, a 4-year-old and his grandmother died after a fire ignited in a hyperbaric chamber at an unaccredited Florida clinic where the child was receiving treatment for cerebral palsy. Two staff members were charged in their deaths, one of whom was a doctor who did not serve jail time but lost his medical license. The status of the legal case against the other employee, the center\u2019s safety director, was not clear.",
      "Harrington said the Coopers\u2019 lawsuit would look at any alleged failures that could have contributed to his death.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s operator error or machine malfunction, it should never, ever happen under any circumstances,\u201d he said."

      "The civil suit \u201cis voluntarily dismissed with prejudice,\u201d the woman\u2019s attorney wrote in a notice filed Friday in U.S. district court in Manhattan.",
      "The woman, now an adult, and her lawyers acknowledged in response to questions from NBC News that there were inconsistencies in her account when the lawsuit was refiled in December to name Jay-Z but said that she stood by her allegations. The suit alleged the incident occurred in 2000.",
      "Both Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, and Combs have denied any wrongdoing. Carter has said \u201cthis incident didn\u2019t happen.\u201d",

      "\u201cToday is a victory. The frivolous, fictitious and appalling allegations have been dismissed. This civil suit was without merit and never going anywhere,\u201d Carter said in a statement through Roc Nation. \u201cThe fictional tale they created was laughable, if not for the seriousness of the claims.\u201d",

And of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an interview with \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. \u201cBut we will have low chance, low chance, to survive without support of the United States. I think it\u2019s very important, critical.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to think about\u201d fighting against Russia without American support, Zelenskyy said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want to think that we will not be strategic partners.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to come to the negotiating table not to end the war but to get a ceasefire deal that would lift certain international sanctions on Russia and would allow the Russian military to regroup.",
      "The backdrop: Zelenskyy\u2019s comments came during a fractious summit in Germany, where Vice President JD Vance criticized European leaders on a host of issues unrelated to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, including failing to stand up for \u201cvalues shared with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier presented his own unvarnished view in response, saying that the Trump administration had \u201cno regard for established rules, partnership and grown trust.\u201d",
      "The widening gulf between Europe and the United States comes at an especially delicate time for Zelenskyy and an exhausted and depleted Ukraine. While the war appears to have descended into a quagmire, Russian forces have been making slow if painful progress. Russia controls some 20% of the country, which is in dire need of weapons and soldiers.",

      "Like any good Valentine\u2019s story, this one is taking more than just the one day to play out. It started on Monday, when Emil Bove, the acting deputy attorney general and former Trump lawyer, ordered the top federal prosecutor in New York, Danielle Sassoon, to drop corruption charges against Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "Trump wants Adams to help deport more migrants \u2014 putting political pressure on other mayors to do the same \u2014 and Adams, presumably, did not want to risk going to prison himself.",
      "Sassoon did not go to court to pull the prosecution. Instead, she resigned on Thursday, revealing that top Justice Department officials met with Adams\u2019 defense lawyers to map out what she said amounted to a quid pro quo. Several of her deputies also quit.",
      "Adams and his lawyers have denied a quid pro quo, but the Trump administration has done little to dissuade the public from reaching a similar conclusion. In an unfortunate turn of phrase, Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan touted the deal in a joint Fox News interview with Adams Friday. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t come through,\u201d Homan said, \u201cI\u2019ll be in his office, up his butt, saying, \u2018Where the hell is the agreement we came to?\u2019\u201d",
      "The episode is reminiscent of the Saturday Night Massacre. In October 1973, Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox \u2014 the man investigating Nixon. Richardson resigned instead. So did Richardson\u2019s deputy, William Ruckelshaus. Finally, Solicitor General Robert Bork executed on Nixon\u2019s order.",
      "That act of fealty to president and party no doubt contributed to Bork\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan more than a decade later \u2014 and to the Senate\u2019s refusal to confirm Bork.",
      "Public outrage over the Saturday Night Massacre led to a reform law and to decades of efforts by Nixon\u2019s successors to either distance themselves from prosecutorial decisions or give the appearance of distance.",
      "Trump chafed at the norm during his first term, when he soured on \u2014 and eventually fired \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate any Trump ties to Russia.",
      "But in the current case, unlike the Watergate and Russia probes, the president is not a target of investigation or prosecution. There\u2019s no law preventing the president from directing prosecutions from the White House. Even if there were, the Supreme Court made clear last year that the president can\u2019t be prosecuted for official actions anyway.",
      "Adams does not enjoy such immunity, and it will be interesting to see whether state charges are brought against him in New York.",
      "But what\u2019s more interesting is what the episode reveals about Trump, his long-standing complaints about the politicization of the Justice Department, and his oft-repeated promise to clean up corruption in the federal government. He does not apply the same standards to himself, and there\u2019s no indication that he intends to.",

That agency designs, builds and oversees the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile.",
      "The cuts, affecting employees categorized as \u201cprobationary,\u201d are the latest step in the far-reaching plans by Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk to slash the size of the government.",

      "The purge, just ahead of a long President\u2019s Day weekend, was swift. Some employees at the CDC were told they had two hours to collect their belongings and leave before losing access to the building, according to a CDC employee.",
      "Some employees reacted with alarm, not only at their personal circumstances but also at the potential consequences for the nation of having a less capable federal workforce.",
      "\u201cThe brain trust that was just terminated is insane,\u201d said a nuclear safety specialist at the NNSA who was fired Thursday. She said her job was ensuring that the nuclear facilities in four states were safe. Like others affected by the firings, she spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "At Homeland Security, 405 people were cut, including more than 130 at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and more than 200 at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to a department spokesperson.",
      "The Trump administration imposed the job cuts unilaterally, without seeking the approval of Congress to shrink or overhaul federal agencies. Democrats, labor unions and progressive organizations have protested that the moves by Musk and Trump are unlawful and violate the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers giving Congress authority over federal spending. More than 60 lawsuits against the Trump administration alleging executive overreach and other violations are pending.",

      "Hundreds of thousands of people could be affected, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management, although the full scope of the firings was not immediately clear. OPM officials began the process for the mass firings Thursday as they met with agency leaders and advised them to dismiss probationary employees, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "\u201cThe probationary period is a continuation of the job application process, not an entitlement for permanent employment,\u201d OPM said in a statement Friday.",

      "McLaurine Pinover, an OPM spokesperson, said she did not have a tally of the number of firings because agencies aren\u2019t due to report back their totals until 8 p.m. Tuesday. She said that, to her knowledge, no federal agency was spared entirely. She also said that the firings of probationary employees were separate from any actions taken by Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).",
      "The mass firings are in addition to the voluntary \u201cdeferred resignation\u201d program that the Trump administration has offered to federal workers who agree to quit later this year in exchange for still being paid for several more months. About 75,000 people had accepted that offer as of Wednesday, according to the White House; NBC News cannot independently verify the number.",
      "The administration is aiming to cut up to 10% of the federal workforce.",
      "Musk has dismissed the idea that his cuts could cause harm. In a social media post at 1:42 a.m. on Friday, he compared the government to a broken computer.",
      "\u201cHave you tried turning the government off and on again?\u201d he posted on X.",
      "Musk and Trump are scheduled to sit for a joint interview Tuesday with Fox News host Sean Hannity.",
      "Federal employee compensation makes up about 6.6% of the overall budget, so even mass firings are unlikely to have a major impact on the government\u2019s budget deficit.",
      "In the federal government, a probationary period applies to new employees and employees new in their roles, regardless of their performance.",
      "One employee of the Department of Housing and Urban Development showed NBC News a copy of their last performance review with an \u201cexceeds fully successful\u201d rating. That employee received an email Friday saying their employment was being terminated \u201cas part of a workforce restructuring.\u201d The email also said they did not have a right to file a grievance over the termination.",
      "At some agencies, the administration appears to be using a meat axe rather than a scalpel.",
      "Senior-level HUD managers were told in meetings to eventually expect an overall reduction in force of up to 50%, two HUD employees said. They said there had not yet been a widely distributed email about the plans.",
      "At the Environmental Protection Agency, hundreds of employees were fired on Friday via an email that went out at around 5 p.m., according to Marie Owens Powell, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238. The union represents 8,500 EPA staffers, and Powell said EPA managers said that at least 300 workers she represents had been laid off.",
      "The email said employees in the office at the time \"must turn in your EPA badge, laptop, parking hang tag, travel credit card, office keys, and any other EPA property in your possession immediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of the people weren\u2019t in, they were home already,\u201d Powell said. \u201cPeople are beside themselves, they\u2019re upset.\u201d",
      "At the CDC, the cuts affected nearly 1,300 probationary employees, or about 10% of the agency\u2019s workforce, according to The Associated Press.",
      "A technologist at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who was fired Thursday said they were doing alright personally but were stressed about the dismantling of their agency.",
      "\u201cI feel so devastated for what this means for consumers and the CFPB\u2019s ability to protect consumers from shady practices,\u201d they said.",
      "\u201cI came to government to serve the public and protect people and, by eliminating our technologists, they\u2019ve hindered the CFPB\u2019s ability to look into bad practices by Big Tech, especially as more and more of them enter the consumer finance space,\u201d they added.",
      "The CFPB opened relatively recently, in 2011, as part of Congress\u2019 response to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. It targets unlawful debt collection practices and similar abuses, while many Republicans have long argued that its rules are too burdensome for legitimate businesses.",
      "Musk and Trump have called for shutting down the CFPB as well as other federal offices such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Education Department.",
      "At the Energy Department, probationary employees were terminated Thursday and staff were briefed on a plan for a large-scale \u201creduction in force\u201d to begin within 30 days, according to a source familiar with the briefing. The plan included a schedule to bring many employees back to physical offices by the end of March, the source said.",
      "A document posted on the website of NASA and dated Tuesday says that the space agency is also planning for a reduction in force, though it doesn\u2019t say how widespread it would be. A NASA\u00a0spokesperson said Friday that the agency is \u201ccomplying with the guidance and direction provided by OPM\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s premature to discuss the impact to our agency.\u201d",
      "While Americans are split on whether the government should be bigger or smaller, many federal agencies are widely admired by the general public. NASA is the third most-admired federal agency, with 67% of U.S. adults holding a favorable view of it, according to a survey last year by the Pew Research Center. The CDC was No. 4, with 55% saying they had a favorable view.",
      "Now, some fired workers face dire personal circumstances, especially in a difficult job market.",
      "\u201cI will say, on a personal level, I am terrified,\u201d said the former NNSA nuclear safety specialist. The now ex-employee has three children, including a 13-year-old and a 10-year-old who are both autistic and require extra support. The ex-employee said her husband is tied down to a job in New Mexico, where they live.",
      "\u201cI may have to move without my husband and kids to find a job,\u201d she said, but that might be easier said than done \u201cwith the flood of federal people coming into the job market.\"",
      "At the NNSA, the termination notifications came by email with the subject line: \u201cNotification of Termination During Probationary/Trial Period.\u201d",
      "Democrats and progressive advocacy groups searched for ways to push back on the cuts, including by highlighting the potential fallout for members of the public.",
      "\u201cFiring this many critical employees at once could make it impossible for our government to provide BASIC services,\u201d said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, in a post on Bluesky. She said other affected agencies included the Small Business Administration and the Department of Education.",
      "Demonstrators gathered in near-freezing temperatures Friday for a \u201cDefy DOGE\u201d protest outside the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Speakers accused Musk of trying to further enrich himself, and one sign read: \u201cNo one voted for Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon defended changes at the department.",
      "\u201cHHS is following the Administration\u2019s guidance and taking action to support the President\u2019s broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government. This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "The Trump administration had been quietly preparing for the firings for weeks by gathering lists of recently hired employees who were still in their probationary period \u2014 before the full protections of the civil service had kicked in.",
      "The process has at times been slapdash; the CIA sent its list of probationary employees in an unclassified email, prompting concern that foreign adversaries could obtain it."

    "story": [
      "The average National Basketball Association team is worth $4.66 billion, according to CNBC Sport\u2019s official NBA valuations. This places the league between the average National Football League team, worth $6.49 billion, and the average National Hockey League team, worth $1.92 billion.",
      "The most valuable NBA team is the Golden State Warriors, worth $9.4 billion. The Warriors generated $781 million in revenue \u2014 net of their revenue-sharing payment \u2014 during the 2023-24 season, the highest in the NBA. The Warriors own their home arena, San Francisco\u2019s Chase Center, from which they also earn revenue from non-NBA events. The team raked in nearly $200 million in sponsorship revenue last season, nearly double that of any other team, according to a league executive.",
      "It may not be surprising that the value of the Warriors has increased at a\u00a024% compound annual growth rate\u00a0since Joe Lacob and Peter Guber paid $450 million for the team in 2010. After all, the Warriors have won\u00a0four NBA titles\u00a0over the past decade, moved into their\u00a0state-of-the-art arena\u00a0in 2019 and have been led by\u00a0two-time league MVP\u00a0Stephen Curry.",
      "But even the\u00a0small-market\u00a0Memphis Grizzlies, the NBA\u2019s least valuable team, worth $3.2 billion, have been a great investment for owner Robert Pera. The Grizzlies have\u00a0not been to the NBA Finals\u00a0since entering the league in 1995 and generally rank in the bottom third of the NBA in\u00a0average attendance. Yet, the value of the Grizzlies has increased at a\u00a019% annual rate\u00a0since Pera paid $377 million for the team in 2012.",
      "According to team executives, the biggest reason for the rising tide in NBA valuations has been the increase in national media rights, which are divided equally among the league\u2019s 30 teams. In July, the NBA agreed to a new media rights package\u00a0worth $76 billion\u00a0over 11 years, beginning with the 2025-26 season.

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 23:30:52 GMT",
    "summary": "Latino Republican lawmakers who approve of Trump are toeing a fine line between supporting his immigration crackdown and standing by their constituents.",
    "story": [
      "In the three weeks since President Donald Trump took office, Americans have witnessed a frenzy of arrests and deportations.",
      "But the president is beginning to run into the hard reality of limited resources, raising questions about whether this administration can keep up the pace.",
      "The speed of deportations is proving too slow for Trump. He has turned up the pressure on the Department of Homeland Security,  Immigration and Customs Enforcement and his advisers to deport more people, sources told NBC News.",
      "Although at the start of the week Trump had expressed confidence in his immigration enforcement operation, by late Tuesday the top two officials in ICE's enforcement division had been demoted, officials confirmed to NBC News. The demotions were first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "How many people have been arrested and detained?",
      "ICE did not respond to questions about the latest immigration enforcement numbers. There also was no response to a request for comment on the pace of arrests and the cost of the operations.",
      "DHS posted on X that, as of Feb. 3, its agents had arrested 8,768 people.",
      "In January, ICE acting Director Caleb Vitello told ICE agents to aim for 1,200 to 1,400 arrests a day.",
      "On Jan. 27, ICE arrested 1,179 people, according to data obtained by NBC News. But the number dropped to 300 the first weekend in February, a source told NBC News.",
      "Arrests have been taking place in several major cities, including New York, Chicago and Denver, using personnel from other agencies to help make them.",
      "Trump may further expand manpower by deputizing IRS agents to investigate employers of people working illegally in the country. Already aiding the deportation operation  are personnel from the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Drug Enforcement Administration; and the U.S. Marshals Service.",
      "But ICE officials have told lawmakers they may not have all they need to carry out Trump\u2019s ambitious operation. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said that Trump\u2019s border czar Tom Homan and budget director Russell Vought pleaded with Senate lawmakers in a meeting this week for more money.",
      "\u201cWhile there is this mass deportation effort in name, there is no resource change to the agencies that are involved,\u201d said Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. \u201cICE is operating under the same budget that it had on Jan. 19.\" Trump\u2019s inauguration was Jan. 20.",
      "How many people have been deported?",
      "There were 5,693 deportations as of Feb. 3, according to the DHS post on X. It\u2019s unclear if this figure includes all people flown back to their home countries or if it includes those who were sent back to Mexico across the border.",
      "ICE\u2019s average cost during the Biden administration for deporting a single person was about $10,500, including arrest, detention and the deportation flight, sources have told NBC News.",
      "The administration had enough beds to hold 41,500 detainees at any given time at 106 facilities nationally, at a cost of $57,378 annually per bed. NBC News has previously reported that the Trump administration wants to open new detention centers and is preparing to restart detaining families.",
      "Meanwhile, the administration is removing protections from deportation for some people, enlarging the pool of people who could be arrested and would need to be detained. Some 350,000 Venezuelans are due to lose Temporary Protected Status in April.",
      "Trump has said he wants to use Guant\u00e1namo Bay for about 30,000 migrants. Last Tuesday, the administration sent its first flight of detainees to the U.S. naval base where foreigners apprehended after the Sept. 11 attacks have been held. A small migrant center at the base also held people interdicted at sea. On Thursday, a senior DHS official told NBC News there were 112 immigrants detained at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.",
      "Hit with space limits and court orders limiting detention time, the administration has been releasing some people they\u2019ve arrested. They continue tracking them with detention alternatives, such as ankle monitors, and by requiring them to check in with immigration officials.",
      "On Feb. 6, the White House confirmed 461 people were released.",
      "Two New York attorneys told NBC News that some immigrant clients already in such supervision programs have been told by ICE to report in sooner than scheduled and are being detained and deported when they do.",
      "The administration has also opened up some previously closed deportation avenues.",
      "Those deported have included people from Venezuela, which had not been accepting its citizens back for years. Trump sent an envoy to meet with Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who agreed to take back citizens deported from the U.S. Two Venezuelan planes returned with about 190 people on Monday.",
      "Following visits from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Guatemala and El Salvador agreed to accept more deportees, from their countries and others. The administration has also deported nearly 120 Asian migrants of several nationalities to Panama as part of an agreement with the country\u2019s president.",
      "Tom Cartwright, a former finance executive who has voluntarily tracked deportation flights since 2000, said the military flights, ICE Air flights and flights from other countries have made tracking deportations more complex. ICE does not provide tracking information. Cartwright uses publicly available information, a network of observers and sources to track the flights and people deported.",
      "So far, the deportation flights are not exceeding normal numbers, said Cartwright, who does the tracking for Witness at the Border, an immigrant advocacy group.",
      "According to his report, in the eight days from Jan. 24 to Jan. 31 \u2014 days after Trump became president \u2014 the Air Force carried out eight deportation flights on C-17 cargo planes. An additional two that were to fly deportees to Colombia were not allowed to land.",
      "In all, there were 109 deportation flights in January, with 65 before the inauguration and 44 after, including the eight military flights, according to Cartwright\u2019s tracking.",
      "Cartwright said to compare flights over time, he tallies the numbers of flights that take place on nonholiday weekdays. In January, before the inauguration, the number of flights per nonholiday weekday was five, and after inauguration it was 4.9.\u00a0 From the start of February to Feb. 8, the number was up to about six per nonholiday weekday, but still \u201cwithin a very normal range,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe long and short of it is, the military planes are not augmenting deportations to a level that is outside of the pattern. They are simply being used, in my view, (for) pure theatrics in the worst sense of the word,\u201d Cartwright said.",
      "Trump promised in January to continue using military jets and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said their use sends a strong and clear message that \u201cif you illegally enter the United States of America, you will face severe consequences.\u201d",
      "How much is this costing?",
      "Republicans in Congress are working to speed billions to the administration to pay the costs associated with its mass deportation operation. The president has said he wants to deport \"millions and millions\" of people; deporting 1 million immigrants in a year would require deportations of 2,700 immigrants each day.",
      "In budget blueprints, Senate Republicans have proposed $175 billion for border security, while the House GOP is calling for $110 billion for immigration and border security. The numbers are starting points in what could be a weekslong process.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not building a wall folks, we\u2019re hitting a wall,\u201d Graham said Tuesday. \u201cThey need the money, and they need it now.\u201d",
      "Trump told NBC News before he took office that cost was no object in enacting his mass deportation plan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of a price tag,\u201d he said in an interview in November. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2014 really, we have no choice.\u201d",
      "An accounting how much the arrests and deportations could cost taxpayers are yet to come. The administration has been considering moving money from other agencies, including the Transportation Security Administration, to plug a $230 million shortfall ICE already faced at the start of the administration, NBC News reported.",
      "In a 2023 budget hearing testimony, the acting ICE Director said deportation flights cost $17,000 per flight hour for 135 people deported and last about five hours, Reuters reported.",
      "Previous administrations have set priorities on whom to arrest, detain and deport, in part, because of limited resources.",
      "ICE\u2019s budget for the 2024 fiscal year is about $9.4 billion, said Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who serves on the House Appropriations Committee.",
      "How the bills on mass deportation will be paid \u201cdepends on how the majority (in Congress) wants to do this,\u201d said Cuellar, who often votes for increased funding for border security and immigration enforcement.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s either you cut somewhere else or you raise revenues,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think the majority will be looking at cutting somewhere else, unless they want to add to the deficit.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that it would be \u201cvery, very, very difficult\u201d for Ukraine to survive without U.S. military support, both now as it tries to repel Russia's invasion and in the future after the war ends.",
      "\"Probably it will be very, very, very difficult. And of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance,\" Zelenskyy told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. \"But we will have low chance, low chance, to survive without support of the United States. I think it\u2019s very important, critical.\"",
      "\"I don\u2019t want to think about\" fighting against Russia without American support, Zelenskyy told \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker.",
      "\"I don\u2019t want to think that we will not be strategic partners,\" he added.",
      "The Ukrainian president also spoke about his concern that Ukraine would be vulnerable to another major attack by Russia in the future if the U.S. does not continue providing military support.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to come to the negotiating table not to end the war but to get a ceasefire deal that would lift certain international sanctions on Russia and would allow its military to regroup.",
      "\"This is really what he wants. He wants pause, prepare, train, take off some sanctions, because of ceasefire and et cetera,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "Zelenskyy's comments came during a fractious summit in Germany, where Vice President JD Vance\u00a0criticized European leaders on a host of issues unrelated to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, including failing to stand up for \u201cvalues shared with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier presented his own unvarnished view in response, saying that the Trump administration had \u201cno regard for established rules, partnership and grown trust.\u201d",
      "The widening gulf between Europe and the United States comes at an especially delicate time for Zelenskyy and an exhausted and depleted Ukraine. While the war appears to have descended into a quagmire, Russian forces have been making slow if painful progress. Russia controls some 20% of the country, which is in dire need of weapons and soldiers.",
      "Ukraine and its supporters always knew that the incoming White House would take a vastly different tack from former President Joe Biden, who backed Ukrainian victory while sometimes not giving Kyiv all the weapons it wanted in its fight against Russia.",
      "But the words and actions of Trump and his surrogates this week have stunned and even appalled many in Europe, where it\u2019s widely held that it is not in the West's interest to not hand Russia a win in Ukraine.",
      "Vance's speech felt like he was trying \"to pick a fight with us, and we don\u2019t want to a pick a fight with our friends,\" E.U. foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said at the Munich summit.",
      "But officials and experts fear Trump risks doing just that, with the president this week appearing to prioritize Putin over Zelenskyy or European allies in any potential peace talks. Trump's administration also floated major concessions to Putin \u2014 including giveaways on Ukrainian territory and dismissing any hope that it may join NATO.",
      "Zelenskyy has kept a brave face, but has little choice to do otherwise, some observers say. He recently told The Economist that he did not believe the U.S. had a \"ready plan\" for peace, while remaining adamant he would reject any agreement negotiated between Washington and Moscow without his involvement.",
      "Trump \"is a strong man,\" the Ukrainian leader said Friday during a panel discussion at the conference with U.S. senators. \"And if he will choose our side, and if he will not be in the middle, I think he will pressure and he will push Putin to stop the war. He can do it.\"",
      "Though Trump signaled little for Ukraine in return, Vance offered some succor to Kyiv and its European neighbors, suggesting in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that Moscow could face sanctions and other penalties.",
      "\u201cThere are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,\u201d Vance told the newspaper. \u201cThere are any number of formulations, of configurations, but we do care about Ukraine having sovereign independence.\u201d",
      "Europe is not just worried about Ukraine but fears what Putin might do next if he\u2019s seen to be rewarded after his invasion there. European intelligence agencies say Russia could attack a NATO ally in the next five years if it believes the alliance has been weakened \u2014 as Trump is often accused of doing.",
      "Russia\u2019s three-year-old invasion is the bloodiest European conflict since World War II, reviving scenes of trench warfare and tank battles that some scholars believed were consigned to history. As many as 1 million people have died, according to NATO estimates, including hundreds of thousands of both Ukrainian and Russian soldiers.",
      "The alliance believes an average of 10,000 people have been killed or injured every week in the frigid, cratered fields of eastern Ukraine."

    "story": [
      "A\u00a0lawsuit filed against Jay-Z and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u00a0by a woman who alleged she was raped when she was 13 years old has been withdrawn by the woman who sued, according to a court filing.",
      "The civil suit \u201cis voluntarily dismissed with prejudice,\u201d the woman\u2019s attorney wrote in a notice filed Friday in U.S. district court in Manhattan.",
      "The woman, now an adult, and her lawyers\u00a0acknowledged in response to questions from NBC News that there were inconsistencies in her account\u00a0when the lawsuit was refiled in December to name Jay-Z but said that she stood by her allegations. The suit alleged the incident occurred in 2000.",
      "Both Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, and Combs have denied any wrongdoing. Carter has said \u201cthis incident didn\u2019t happen.\u201d",
      "On Friday, after the suit was withdrawn, the rapper and music mogul said the claim was false and hurt his family and loved ones. \u201cI would not wish this experience on anyone,\u201d Carter said.",
      "\u201cToday is a victory. The frivolous, fictitious and appalling allegations have been dismissed. This civil suit was without merit and never going anywhere,\u201d Carter\u00a0said in a statement through Roc Nation. \u201cThe fictional tale they created was laughable, if not for the seriousness of the claims.\u201d",
      "The woman said in the lawsuit that she was outside the Video Music Awards in New York City in 2000, and a limo driver invited her to an after-party. She said she felt woozy after having a drink there and was sexually assaulted.",
      "\u201cBy standing up in the face of heinous and false allegations, Jay has done what few can \u2014 he pushed back, he never settled, he never paid 1 red penny, he triumphed and cleared his name,\u201d his attorney, Alex Spiro, said in a written statement Friday.",
      "Combs\u2019 legal team also said they were vindicated by the voluntary dismissal.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s complete dismissal by the 1-800 attorney is yet another confirmation that these lawsuits are built on falsehoods, not facts,\u201d his legal team said.",
      "The lawsuit that was dismissed Friday was filed by Tony Buzbee, a Texas attorney who has filed other lawsuits against Combs.",
      "Buzbee said he had no comment Friday.",
      "Combs was\u00a0criminally charged\u00a0in September with federal counts of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Combs has been sued by multiple people who allege sexual misconduct. Lawyers for Combs have denied the allegations and any misconduct.",
      "Carter has not been accused of any crime. He said in Friday\u2019s statement that he feels the legal system failed by allowing the suit to be brought and then dropped \u201cwith no repercussions.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe court must protect victims, OF COURSE, while with the same ethical responsibility, the courts must protect the innocent from being accused without a shred of evidence,\u201d Carter said. \u201cMay the truth prevail for all victims and those falsely accused equally.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:24:40 GMT",
    "summary": "What is performing or writing for \"Saturday Night Live\" really like? TODAY.com talked to past and present cast to learn what really goes on behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Shortly before \"NBC's Saturday Night\" lit up American TV sets on Oct. 11, 1975, producer Lorne Michaels and seven unknown actors and comedians appeared on \"The Tomorrow Show,\" a late-night talk show with Tom Snyder, to promote their new 90-minute variety series.",
      "\"We've got eight and we're hoping for two for it to really work,\" Michaels deadpanned to Snyder about his new cast. \"So, not all of these people will become stars.\"",
      "Sitting next to him? Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Gilda Radner, John Belushi and Laraine Newman. Despite Michaels' tongue-in-cheek prediction, they would, in fact, go on to become not only stars, but legends as the original Not Ready For Prime Time Players on the soon-to-be renamed \"Saturday Night Live.\"",
      "Now, 50 years later, the sketch comedy show has gone on to become the most Emmy-decorated television show in history, receiving countless nominations, awards and accolades. And, in 2017, those original cast members were inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame.",
      "Defined by its satirical and often censor-defying comedy, along with performances by cutting-edge musicians and artists, \"SNL\" has been a touchstone of American pop culture for five decades. In that time, more than 160 cast members have come and gone, many of them going on to become legends in their own right.",
      "In honor of \"SNL's\" golden anniversary, TODAY.com sat down with past and present cast members to learn what really goes on behind the scenes of the late night show \u2014\u00a0from the anxiety to the exhilaration \u2014 what viewers at home might be surprised to find out, along with their take on the best character breaks and sketches that didn't go quite as planned.",
      "Here's what they revealed.",
      "Answers have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Laraine Newman (1975 to 1980)",
      "You can only be aware of the audience that's in the studio. There's no sense, at least from my experience, that there's millions of people watching.",
      "It's like everything I was trained to do at The Groundlings where we did sketches and were in place, in costume, doing the sketch, lights out, run off, change, get back down to your spot, lights up and do the next sketch. That's exactly what \"SNL\" is.",
      "What's heroic is that the set designers, they have four days to build sets for sketches that might not even make it to air. The craft of the look of the show, the work that goes into that, the thought that goes into it. The fact that the writers get to collaborate with every aspect \u2014 wardrobe, makeup, everything \u2014 to really optimize their material. I don't think there's any show like that.",
      "Lorne (Michaels) did not want us to laugh, and I never got close to laughing, except when Rodney Dangerfield hosted. We were doing a takeoff on the Woody Allen movie \"Manhattan\" called \"Manhasset.\" (Dangerfield) is saying, \"Tracy, don't go to Manhasset. I tell ya, it's rough. I got a waterbed and there was a guy at the bottom of it.\"",
      "Now, I'd heard that joke in read-through and the rehearsal and it still got me. If you watch it, you can't tell. But I am dying. It is everything I could do not to laugh.",
      "Nora Dunn (1985 to 1990)",
      "There's something about the camera coming on \u2014 you come to life. Because right before that, you're not. It's like your dead, and you're revived and it's a \"do-or-die\" situation. And you go, \"Well, I got here.\" I always tell myself, \"You got here. There's a reason that you are here.\"",
      "I don't think you do it. I think the other side does it. The lights do it. They go, \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ... boom!\" It just happens. You can't plan it.",
      "When you're watching a sketch, right behind that wall, someone's taking their clothes off and putting on a costume and having a wig grabbed off their head and put something else on it. You have to make those quick changes.",
      "You might be on with a guest star, the host, and you're like, \"Gotta get my clothes off!\" You're not naked, but next to naked. Every time there's a sketch on \"Saturday Night Live,\" there's all kinds of stuff going on in the background.",
      "We were not supposed to use cue cards, but we all did. But Lorne was like (imitating Michaels), \"They're there if you need them. That's why they're not there, because you don't know your lines.\"",
      "So, Jon (Lovitz) and I had to do a sketch with Charlton Heston. He needed glasses, but he said he didn't. He didn't wear glasses, so they had to make his cue cards huge. So, we had huge stacks of cue cards and we were doing an Egyptian scene. We're dressed up as a couple that's having pyramids built, and the cue card guy lost control of the cards. They spread all over the floor. Lorne was standing 15 feet away and he was furious. We just beelined away from Lorne because he was going to say (imitating Michaels), \"Well, someone didn't learn their lines.\" He was not happy with us.",
      "Kevin Nealon (1986 to 1995)",
      "It's unlike anything I've ever experienced before. It's like sitting in a rollercoaster car, right at the beginning, just anticipating and waiting for it all to happen. And it was a rollercoaster, there were ups and downs, it was crazy.",
      "I remember before I did my first sketch, it was \"Mr. Subliminal,\" and right before, Lorne Michaels comes up to me, puts his hand on my shoulder, and he said, \"Are you sure this is what you want?\" It was funny and it relaxed me a little bit.",
      "But I remember the excitement of the first show. I think The Pretenders were on, and I remember finishing a sketch, then running back to get made up and I'm hearing the band playing and I'm thinking, \"Oh my God,\" and I got filled with such energy and excitement that, \"This is it, man, this is live, this is 'Saturday Night Live.'\"",
      "I think the audience doesn't realize how small the studio is when they get there. And I don't think they realize that we're scrambling to figure out what sketches to cut from rehearsal, how to improve a sketch and what didn't work and what you're surprised that did work.",
      "But, also, I think a lot of times they don't realize how frightened we are about going out there.",
      "(Breaking character) was very rare for me and for a lot of people on our cast because, at the time, Lorne thought of that as being very \"hacky.\" Also, it was a disservice to the writer. If you put all this labor into writing a sketch and then people are breaking on it, it's like, \"Well, there goes that sketch.\"",
      "I did break with Chevy Chase on \"Weekend Update\" once, but that was one of the only times I ever broke in nine years.",
      "Molly Shannon (1995 to 2001)",
      "It's exhilaration. When I hosted, for example, right before you go on, you're in the back and you're with a stage manager and they're like, \"OK ... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...\" So, you're like, \"Ugh (clutches her stomach).\"",
      "I got advice when I hosted. Steve Higgins, a wonderful producer on the show was like, \"Take your time. You don't have to run out there. It's OK.\" So, I thought that was good advice. Set yourself on stage, take a deep breath. But, definitely, there's nerves. I would say, an excited, kind of nervous feeling.",
      "I remember years ago, when I did the show, we would all have dinner after the rehearsals, before the live show. And I remember, because we had the whole week of writing comedy sketches, rehearsing them at dinner, I felt like, \"Ugh, this is time to just relax before the big comedy show live at 11:30 p.m.\"",
      "But people would still be doing comedy bits at dinner and I remember thinking I just wanted to talk seriously and not have anybody joke around, like, have like a quiet dinner before we have to go do a show. I was like, \"No comedy bits at dinner, like, please, let's just eat.\"",
      "Will Ferrell and I were characters who had recently lost 100 pounds, and we were very excited about it. We did it center stage and Will Ferrell and I always had a deal that, if you bombed, if you were tanking, and people weren't laughing, you would still have to commit as an actor, pour your heart into it even more.",
      "While we're performing it, there were crickets, no laughter at all. I remember during the scene, looking at Will, we were like (grimace), but we just kept performing it like the greatest dramatic actors, and we thought it was so funny. So, it entertained us that you had to bomb with grace and dignity, to just jump into bombing and be OK with it. Scoring and bombing were on equal planes \u2014 you had to respect both.",
      "Cheri Oteri (1995 to 2000)",
      "I would always be in the bathroom. That's how fearful I was. I was always very nervous. It's sheer fear and excitement. But because you only get a chance to do it once, it's more fear for me. But I've always been like that, even when I did theater. I was always in the bathroom until it was like, \"10, 9, 8 ...\"",
      "We have a two-hour draft show at 8 o'clock, then a half hour is cut out of that and you're just ... nothing's ever settled until 11:30 p.m. You're working to get your sketches in during the week and you don't know if they're going to get in. And if they do get in, they could always be cut between dress and air.",
      "Nothing is guaranteed. So that's kind of hard. I always say it's a show that you audition for every week, that you already got.",
      "There was one time I broke and it was doing \"Morning Latte.\" It was with Jerry Seinfeld. In this sketch, Will (Ferrell) goes like this (makes hitting motion) with a book and it hits me in the head. That book hit me so hard in the head \u2014 but it didn't hurt. It just clocked. And because of the book being a hardcover, the sound just reverberated and the audience went, \"Ooohhh.\"",
      "I went back and I saw stars. I started laughing and I couldn't stop. Will had to say my lines. Tears are coming down, I'm laughing so much. I've never not been able to recover from something. But because I saw stars, I couldn't stop laughing.",
      "But it was dress, so on air, I knew it was coming. But that was the one and only time I broke.",
      "Ana Gasteyer (1996 to 2002)",
      "Those last 15 seconds right before you go live, I think it's largely fear. It's not fear, necessarily, about failing or anything like that, but it's all so last-minute that it's just your brain synthesizing what has inevitably changed in your sketch moments before you've started and the breakneck pace of it because it really is live.",
      "What people don't understand \u2014\u00a0it's live, and it's written that week, that minute, that day. We may have written a sketch on Tuesday night, but it got rewritten on Thursday. It got rewritten again on Friday and then rewritten before your dress.",
      "You may have just come off another experience, may have had a failed quick change or stressed moment because commercial breaks are only two minutes. They might feel long when you're at home, but two minutes is really, really, really fast to have to change an entire outfit and wig. So, what's happening in those 15 seconds is kind of rooting yourself in the space of what you're going to do.",
      "You know, when you're coming back from a commercial and you're at home and you're like, \"Gosh, why is this taking so long? Why am I looking at this picture of Ariana Grande for so incredibly long?\"",
      "That's because, wildly, some set has not been assembled. That's what those bumper (photo) cards are for, to buy a little bit of time on the edges of your returns.",
      "There was a sketch we did, a Sally Jessy Raphael with Christina Ricci. She had never done live television before, so she was really spooked and kind of addled, and maybe had a little champagne. There was a bad teen sketch and I was Sally Jessy, there was a fist fight.",
      "It looked bad at dress. Lorne, in the notes, between dress and air, was like, \u201cLet\u2019s work on that punch.\u201d We didn\u2019t have a fight coordinator, it was very unrehearsed and the depth perception was off. We got to air and (Christina) was so focused, and that fist hit my nose in such a dramatic, hilarious, painful ... I mean, in the moment I remember my Sally Jessy red signature frames went flying up off my face and landed in, like, slow motion. It was insane. It was like a full-face TKO. I remember just being like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to maintain the impression,\u201d because I was so nervous about my Sally Jessy impression the whole time.",
      "Rachel Dratch (1999 to 2006)",
      "It's kind of a mix. Definite excitement, nerves ... fear is a factor. Doing theater before \"SNL,\" the fear is kind of what drives you. So, the fear is good actually. But, overall, excitement.",
      "This is kind of common sense, but you don't think of it when you're watching at home: That in between when you're watching a commercial, all the madness is happening because it's live. Someone's changing costume, hair, someone can go from being a baby to an old man in that commercial. There's a team of people working \u2014\u00a0every person has their own hair, makeup and wardrobe person. So, there's this huge transformation taking place or the sets are being moved.",
      "A sketch that went wrong in the best way possible was the \"Debbie Downer at Disney World,\" where we started laughing. That's the one everyone seems to remember so well. People tell me they watch when they're sad to cheer them up and that makes me so happy.",
      "But, yes, of course, we try not to laugh on the show. But that one, knowing the camera was coming in every time after I was saying this total bummer fact, and trying to keep it together, it just shows that this show is live. If there's any doubt, things can go wrong. And sometimes it's very funny when they do.",
      "Amy Poehler (2001 to 2008)",
      "Performing on \"SNL\" feels like working in a comedy emergency room. So you are rushing around sometimes, sometimes things are slow. You are around trained professionals, you have high stakes and it feels often very life or death.",
      "There's so many surprising things about \"SNL\" that people wouldn't realize. It's such a unique unicorn of a show and the way it's put together. I think a lot of people don't realize how tired everyone is all the time, especially during read through, because people have stayed up all night and then go in and have to perform.",
      "I think people also don't realize how most of your time at \"SNL\" is wondering when your food is going to get there. That's about 75% of your brain space, \"When is my food going to come?\" So, I think a lot of people are thinking that when (viewers) are thinking that they're thinking about sketches.",
      "My first year on \"SNL,\" the great John Goodman hosted and was so nice to me, even though I was a lone freshman. I remember I did a sketch with Chris Kattan and I got flipped into a dumpster \u2014 on purpose. I think I kind of passed out for a second and then woke up and I remember thinking, \"I wonder if anyone's ever passed out on 'SNL?' Then I thought, \"How long have I been in this dumpster?\" So, that was fun. That was a good entry into what was a wild ride.",
      "Mikey Day (2013 to Present)",
      "It's so week-to-week. That's how the show works. You could have a week when you're in everything, you could have a week where you have three lines and one thing. It all depends. So, I feel like the emotions vary depending on that week.",
      "However, one constant is that after, \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night,\" and the band starts playing, that's when the adrenaline (starts) and I'm always reminded, \"Oh wow, it's 'SNL,'\" and I always get kind of a little high off that.",
      "There's so many heroes on that show. The crew, itself, is, like, Tetris because Studio 8H isn't that big. So, they're constantly moving and all the equipment feels like it's from the '70s. This stuff has that old-school feel in terms of its size and bulk, and moving it to and fro on Saturday is pretty crazy. But they make it work somehow.",
      "Also, the filmed pieces, they build those sets in a day \u2014 a literal day \u2014 and sometimes there's three films being shot in one week, which is wild.",
      "Most recently, it was \"Beavis and Butthead\" with Ryan Gosling. It was a lot of fun. Heidi (Gardner) broke, Ryan and I were laughing, giggling like two schoolboys.",
      "But I remember the first time I laughed and it was in an unpredictable sketch called \"Dog Head Man.\" It's like geneticists who have created Dog Head Man. It was so dumb. At dress they were feeding the dog some treat or something and the dog didn't really like it. We're like, \"Can we just give it bread?\" And then it just went to town on this bread and I started laughing because Sam Rockwell and I were talking about such heavy stuff, and you just see the dog is so happy, going to town on human food.",
      "Dog Head Man stands out as one that I remember as the first time I kind of lost it. It wasn't too bad, but when you start to go, you're like, \"Oh no, I haven't done this before, am I going to get in trouble?\"",
      "Heidi Gardner (2017 to present)",
      "It's all of those things, actually. But I always just remind myself to have fun, take a few deep breaths. I'm going to do my job, the words are going to come out. That's always the biggest fear: Am I just going to stop knowing how to read cue cards? But it happens.",
      "I had never seen the show as a fan \u2014 I was a fan, but I had never gone to it. I really didn't understand that it was all in the same studio. I thought \"Weekend Update\" was in a separate room, that you walked down the hall to \"Weekend Update,\" then you walk to a sketch, but it's all in the studio. So, those two-minute commercial breaks really are like just complete chaos. The most organized chaos in the world. And it's really its own art form to watch the crew navigate that.",
      "Well, obviously, \"Beavis and Butthead,\" but there was one last season I did with Kristen Wiig, where we were \"Mad Men\" type secretaries and she was supposed to fall through a desk, like sit on a desk and it breaks away. And I was supposed to fall through a wall and both of us just didn't quite have the strength to break either one.",
      "So, she sat on the desk and it didn't break and then she had to hop down. I went into the wall and it didn't break. So it was very funny to try and navigate that live.",
      "Chloe Fineman (2019 to Present)",
      "Performing on \"SNL\" is truly a fever dream. After so many shows, I'm like, \"Wait, what? I was with who? And I kissed so and so? Or, was on stage with Ariana Grande?\" It really runs the gamut. It's very surreal, I'd say.",
      "I think viewers at home would be surprised to learn about the machine that happens during the live show. Anytime I've had friends and family come, it's amazing to watch. The sets are running over here and we're running here and there's heels and this thing's getting taken apart and put together. It happens like clockwork and, really, so much can go wrong. For some reason, it doesn't and it's magic. To me, that's almost as entertaining as the show.",
      "We did a \"Castaway\" sketch with Jason Momoa and he was supposed to lift me up and we were supposed to pretend to, like, have our bodies move, but he's so much bigger than me and I'm so short and little, that I really was like, \"Woo!\" He really thrusted me in a way that took my breath away. Honestly, that's a favorite."

      "Evan \"Buck\" Buckley hates basketball. Oliver Stark does not.",
      "\"You should have seen the way my face lit up when I got asked to do this,\" Stark tells TODAY.com ahead of the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, tipping off Feb. 14 at 7 p.m. ET.",
      "Stark, who has played Buck on the Ryan Murphy-created drama \"9-1-1\" since it premiered in 2018, will play on Team Rice, coached by Jerry Rice and Khaby Lame, alongside teammates Shaboozey, Walker Hayes and more.",
      "Stark arrived in the Bay Area for the game Feb. 13, just a few hours before his team was set to practice for the first time. His appearance in the game comes amid filming for the back half of Season 8 of \"9-1-1,\" which returns with new episodes March 6.",
      "\"To be quite honest with you, I finished filming about 4 a.m. last night, outside in the rain, so to then wake up and get on an 8 a.m. flight was a little challenging,\" he says. \"But '9-1-1' were actually super accommodating in making sure I was free to do this, but they did send me on my way with a night shoot.\"",
      "One of Stark's character's most memorable recent episodes, titled \"Buck, Bothered and Bewildered,\" fittingly centered on a basketball game.",
      "Season 7, Episode 4, which aired April 4, 2024, saw Buck deal with a newfound jealousy over his best friend Eddie's (Ryan Guzman) new friendship with Tommy (Louis Ferrigno Jr.) Later in the episode, Buck learns via Eddie's wall calendar that he and Tommy have plans to play pick-up basketball, which he decides to crash.",
      "\"You don't like basketball,\" Buck's sister Maddie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) says when he mentions the game.",
      "\"Which is why I say no, but now he's going with Tommy. And he's got it circled,\" Buck says.",
      "\"Is it circled with a heart around it?\" she teases.",
      "Buck attends the game, and tensions boil over as Buck witnesses Eddie and Tommy's camaraderie on the court. After Eddie steals the ball, Buck chases him down before shoving him, fracturing Eddie's ankle. In the end, Tommy apologizes for excluding Buck, while Buck cops to feeling jealous and admitting he had been trying to get Tommy's attention.",
      "Tommy then kisses Buck, marking the character's first onscreen kiss with a man, sending the \"ardent fans\" \u2014 as the Feb. 12 episode of \"Pop Culture Jeopardy!\" put it \u2014 who have long wanted Buck and Eddie to become more than friends, spiraling. (\"It was on 'Jeopardy!'?\" he says when asked about it.)",
      "Stark says he's \"cautiously optimistic\" going into the game.",
      "\"I think I'm trying to focus on, 'I'm just here to have fun,' but I do know that my competitive side will probably take over,\" he says. \"But listen, I might spend the whole game on the bench.\"",
      "He also jokes that his appearance in the celebrity game could serve as some \"redemption\" after Buck's performance in the show's pick-up game.",
      "\"Buck is not a basketball fan. I am a huge basketball fan,\" he says. \"I hope this is something of a redemption arc for me, that I get to display this.\"",
      "Below, Stark chats with TODAY.com about his All-Star Celebrity Game debut, how his \"9-1-1\" cast reacted to him accepting a spot in the game, and he revisits *that* memorable basketball scene from Season 7 of \"9-1-1.\"",
      "This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "So listen, it's been a little while since I've played basketball competitively. I played a lot in high school, but that was some years ago. So as soon as I got the email about this, to be quite honest with you, I said, 'Yes.' I put my phone down. I went to the park, and I've pretty much been there ever since playing day in and day out, just to kind of get it back in my body a little bit.",
      "(Laughs) Well, I'll tell you, one of the things that I miscalculated was, you know, I'm 6' 2\", and so I thought that maybe, you know, for the kind of game that it is, that I might be on the taller side. But I'm actually one of the shorter players. So I'm going to put that as a weakness. And I'm going to put, and I say this tentatively, but sports IQ in my in my strengths column, and hope that works in my favor.",
      "Most of their reactions were to do with my somewhat injured knee that I've been struggling with for the past year. And basically everyone said, \"Is your knee going to be able to handle that?\" To which I said, \"I don't know. I guess we'll find out.\"",
      "But over the weeks of prepping for it, I feel good about it and having told that to them, they're all really excited. And they've all said to make sure I let them know exactly what network it's on, what time, and they're going to be cheering me on from back down in Los Angeles.",
      "\"9-1-1\" returns March 6 with Season 8, Episode 9, titled, \"Sob Stories.\" The midseason finale of the show left Buck reeling when Eddie told him he plans to move to El Paso to be closer to his son, Christopher. Buck has also been mourning the end of his relationship with Tommy, who broke up with Buck in Episode 6. Meanwhile, a trailer for the Season 8 return hints that Buck's sister, Maddie, is about to be kidnapped by a serial killer.",
      "Yeah, there's a ton of different stuff going on. There's a lot of tension  in the upcoming episodes between characters that we don't often see tension between. I think the stories across these (episodes), it's going to be quite a fraught and intense atmosphere for a good healthy portion of it. And that's not something that '9-1-1' tends to do, right? In general, our main cast, our main characters, are a pretty tight knit group, whereas we're going to be looking at what happens when you kind of start to tug at a thread, and you know, it keeps on pulling and pulling, and you kind of watch a lot of things unravel as that goes.",
      "Definitely, and I think they're going to be kind of explored and looked at in a way that is more obvious than kind of has ever been done before on the show. To an extent where I was actually surprised by the extent to which it's going to be explored. So, yeah, no, absolutely, that is to come very soon.",
      "Not that specifically. But just kind of an exploration of what the feelings are.",
      "Yeah... I'll say no more on that."

      "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has been a television institution for 50 years airing thousands of memorable sketches in homes across the country. In that time, the cast and writers have been inspired by many things, from \u201990s cartoons to parenting and so much more, but food and drink have always been a source of comedy for the late-night sketch-comedy show.",
      "With \u201cSNL50: The Anniversary Special\u201d coming out on Sunday, Feb. 16, we thought we would take a look back at the most absurd and absolutely gut-bustingly funny sketches from the iconic show \u2014 through a food-focused lens.",
      "There\u2019s everything from send-ups of existing food brands like Heinz and Sam Adams or restaurants like McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks to completely made-up food concepts that now live in the collective unconscious. \u201cBrownie Husband,\u201d anyone?",
      "Here we go!",
      "\u2018Bass-O-Matic\u2019 \u2014 Season 2 (1976)",
      "Gross-out humor is on full display in this sketch where Dan Akroyd\u2019s salesman character advertises a blender that \u201clets you use the whole bass, without scaling, cutting or gutting.\u201d The real icky-but-hysterical moment happens after Akroyd blends an actual fish and pours it into a glass.",
      "\u2018Little Chocolate Donuts\u2019 \u2014 Season 3 (1977)",
      "John Belushi makes fun of the commercials for a certain sports-themed cereal popular in the late \u201970s. Playing himself in all his (athletic?) glory, Belushi smokes and eats sugary \u201cLittle Chocolate Donuts\u201d yet is able to best any other athlete in his way.",
      "\u2018The Olympia Restaurant\u2019 \u2014 Season 3 (1978)",
      "\u201cCheeseburger, cheeseburger, cheeseburger!\u201d One of the show\u2019s most enduring catch-phrases was uttered in this early sketch where patrons are annoyed that they can only get cheeseburgers, chips and Pepsi at the Olympia Restaurant.",
      "\u2018The French Chef\u2019 \u2014 Season 4 (1978)",
      "In this gory parody of \u201cThe French Chef,\u201d Julia Child (Dan Aykroyd) has an accident with a sharp knife while demonstrating how to bone a chicken and tries to improvise a tourniquet out of a chicken bone and other items in her well-appointed kitchen.",
      "\u2018Anal Retentive Chef\u2019 \u2014 Season 14 (1989)",

      "\u2018Colon Blow\u2019 \u2014 Season 15 (1989)",
      "This Phil Hartman-led skit takes aim at high-fiber cereals. Its subject, Colon Blow, is a cereal with 30,000 times the fiber as regular oat bran cereals \u2014 you can imagine how this ends.",
      "\u2018Nikey Turkey\u2019 \u2014 Season 16 (1990)",
      "A Nike commercial parody where Chris Rock plays a spokesperson who raps about Nikey Turkey, poultry you can pump up to be large enough to feed any family on Thanksgiving.",
      "\u2018Schiller Visions: Hidden Camera Commercials\u2019 \u2014 Season 17 (1992)",
      "Tom Schiller wrote and directed short films for \u201cSNL\u201d for 11 years, and one memorable classic shows one customer\u2019s (Chris Farley) rather outsized reaction when he finds out he\u2019s drinking instant coffee on a hidden camera commercial.",
      "\u201cSchiller Visions\u201d shows just how far Farley was willing to go in a sketch, turning from an even keeled customer out with his wife to an enraged monster that needs to be held down by an entire room full of people in minutes.",
      "\u2018Hub\u2019s Gyros\u2019 \u2014 Season 18 (1993)",
      "Rob Schneider, Adam Sandler, Chris Farley and Robert Smigel play gyro shop workers who are very into the requests of their patrons. Jason Alexander, Tim Meadows and David Spade star as the customers, one who eventually asks the mustachioed gyro shop boys to please end the sketch.",
      "\u2018Crystal Gravy\u2019 \u2014 Season 19 (1993)",
      "This unsettlingly funny sketch has lived in infamy for decades: a commercial for Crystal Gravy, the clear gravy that lets consumers drown their plate and still see the food underneath.",
      "In the time since this aired, several folks, including food writer Dennis Lee, have tried to make a real version of the fake product.",
      "\u2018Adam Sandler: Lunch Lady Land\u2019 \u2014 Season 19 (1994)",
      "In this sketch that shows the camaraderie between best-friend castmates, Adam Sandler sings \u201cLunch Lady Land,\u201d a ditty about a lunch lady (Chris Farley), how angry food revolted against her and how she was saved by Sloppy Joe (Kevin Nealon).",
      "Farley\u2019s interpretive dance to the lyrics is particularly memorable \u2014 and almost breaks Sandler several times.",
      "\u2018Zagat\u2019s with Hank & Beverly Gelfand: Anniversary\u2019 \u2014 Season 20 (1995)",
      "Hank and Beverly Gelfand, a married couple played by Adam Sandler and Chris Farley, read Zagat\u2019s, a restaurant guide, to decide where they\u2019re going to for their anniversary. Beverly is much more invested than Hank, though. Beverly\u2019s sister \u2014 played by David Duchovny \u2014 also stops by.",
      "\u2018NPR\u2019s Delicious Dish: Schweddy Balls\u2019 \u2014 Season 24 (1998)",
      "In this Christmas-season set sketch, innuendo is king. NPR hosts of \u201cThe Delicious Dish\u201d Margaret Jo McCullin (Ana Gasteyer) and Terry Rialto (Molly Shannon) invite baker Pete Schweddy (Alec Baldwin) to discuss his famous holiday dessert: Schweddy Balls.",
      "In about six minutes, the trio wrings every uproarious double-entendre they possibly can \u2014 cementing its place in \u201cSNL\u201d history.",

      "Jack Black plays a chef who refuses to cut his long curly hair, much to the chagrin of anyone who eats his food. In this sketch, he teaches a cooking class to cast members Fred Armisen, Rachel Dratch, Horatio Sanz and Chris Parnell.",
      "\u2018Jamie Lee Curtis for Activia\u2019 \u2014 Season 33 (2008)",
      "Jamie Lee Curtis \u2014\u00a0played by the indomitable Kristen Wiig \u2014 snacks on one too many cups of Activia while filming a commercial for the yogurt brand. While filming with the director (Ashton Kutcher), the star has some unexpected intestinal issues on set, leading to absolute and uproarious hilarity.",
      "\u2018Jon Hamm\u2019s John Ham\u2019 \u2014 Season 34 (2008)",
      "Jon Hamm punnily presents a product that no one could possibly need: Jon Hamm\u2019s John Ham \u2014 ham you can eat in the bathroom.",
      "This sketch, in which Hamm gives flavors of his \u201cMad Men\u201d character Don Draper, inspired at least one artist to make a vintage-style poster in honor of the roll of sliced deli meat.",
      "\u2018Brownie Husband\u2019 \u2014 Season 35 (2011)",
      "Tina Fey stars as a woman who can do it all, but doesn\u2019t have time for a man \u2014  at least a human one. Luckily for her, Duncan Hines has just introduced its new product: Brownie Husband, the very first companion dessert for the single woman.",
      "\u2018Andre the Giant Gets an Ice Cream\u2019 \u2014 Season 37 (2011)",
      "Jason Segel, who once said on \u201cLate Night with Conan O\u2019 Brien\u201d that he has been 6\u20194\u201d since he was 12 years old, plays Andre the Giant in a very short-yet-sweet sketch.",
      "The sketch contributes to a tradition where someone plays a star doing something exceedingly simple, like Liza Minelli trying to turn off a lamp.",
      "\u2018Almost Pizza\u2019 \u2014 Season 37 (2012)",
      "A mother (Kristen Wiig) convinces her family (Bill Hader and Nasim Pedrad) to eat what may look and smell like pizza, but is not actually pizza. Obviously her family has many questions, and none of them get answered in what is one of the most absurd sketches on this list.",
      "\u2018Top Dog Chef\u2019 \u2014 Season 38 (2013)",
      "A punny parody of \u201cTop Chef,\u201d hosted by dog versions of Tom Collichio and Padma Lakshmi, this sketch is filled with canine humor as dog chefs from around the world compete in a televised cooking contest.",
      "\u2018Pizza Business\u2019 \u2014 Season 38 (2013)",
      "Melissa McCarthy\u2019s utter commitment is on full display in a sketch between her and Jason Sudekis. McCarthy plays a deeply strange woman who applies to receive a small business loan to help fund her desire to eat lots of pizza, and you can\u2019t help but root for her.",
      "\u2018McDonald\u2019s Firing\u2019 \u2014 Season 38 (2012)",
      "Host Anne Hathaway plays a manager at McDonald\u2019s who is announcing a firing at a staff meeting. Two employees (Bobby Moynihan and Cecily Strong) severely jump the gun assuming it\u2019s them and lay waste to each and every one of their coworkers.",
      "These characters ended up coming back in subsequent sketches set at Best Buy and Barnes and Noble.",
      "\u2018Guy Fieri\u2019s Full Throttle Christmas Special\u2019 \u2014 Season 39 (2013)",
      "Bobby Moynihan plays Food Network host and electric-hair-haver Guy Fieri in this holiday sketch. In it, he invites his celebrity friends including Kid Rock (Brooks Wheelan), Criss Angel (Kyle Mooney) and Dog the Bounty Hunter (John Goodman).",
      "\u2018Dunkin Donuts\u2019 \u2014 Season 42 (2016)",
      "\u201cSNL\u201d has a loving relationship with Boston \u2014 especially the accent. In fact, \u201cThe Boston Teens\u201d is a beloved series of sketches. In that same vein, Casey Affleck plays Donny, a real Dunkin\u2019 customer with very, very local flair.",
      "\u2018Totino\u2019s with Kristen Stewart\u2019 \u2014 Season 42 (2017)",
      "Back in 2017, \u201cTwilight\u201d star Kristen Stewart came out during her \u2018SNL\u2019 monologue. Later in the show, the two-time host had a romantic entanglement as \u201cSabine\u201d with a surprising character: the lead of Vanessa Bayer\u2019s recurring Totino\u2019s Pizza Rolls sketches.",
      "The steamy sketch reaches hilarious heights when Sabine asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d and Bayer\u2019s character answers, \u201cI ... I\u2019ve never had one.\u201d",
      "\u2018Italian Restaurant\u2019 \u2014 Season 43 (2017)",
      "An engaged couple played by Cecily Strong and host Ryan Gosling react poorly to being tricked that the Italian food they\u2019ve been eating is actually from Pizza Hut.",
      "Gosling\u2019s hothead character threatens to fight a bewildered Mikey Day several times \u2014 slightly breaking character near the end of the sketch.",
      "\u2018Coffee Shop\u2019 \u2014 Season 44 (2018)",
      "In this sketch reminiscent of Season 43\u2019s \u201cItalian Restaurant,\u201d newlyweds played by Adam Driver and Cecily Strong are shocked to find out the Domenico\u2019s coffee they\u2019ve been drinking is actually from Burger King.",
      "\u2018Chopped\u2019 \u2014 Season 44 (2019)",
      "\u201cChopped\u201d judges (Emma Thompson, Aidy Bryant and Alex Moffat) review the dishes made by two finalists (Melissa Villase\u00f1or and Leslie Jones) and from the ingredients to the final dishes, each moment becomes more absurd than the last.",
      "\u2018Extreme Baking Championship\u2019 \u2014 Season 44 (2019)",
      "Baking competition show contestants (Don Cheadle, Heidi Gardner, Leslie Jones, Kyle Mooney) show the judges (Aidy Bryant, Beck Bennett and Ego Nwodim) their sweet creations, but most of them are more worthy of being on \u201cNailed It\u201d than \u201cGreat British Bake Off.\u201d",
      "\u2018Tasty Toaster Tarts\u2019 \u2014 Season 45 (2019)",
      "Chance the Rapper stars in this sketch depicting a fake commercial for Tasty Toaster Tarts. The lighthearted tone quickly turns to dark comedy in the send-up of \u201880s and \u201890s ads for kids snacks. Roasty Toasties, Wingo Dingos, Topsy Turvies and tons of other snacks are abound in the tightly written sketch.",
      "\u2018Pizza Ad\u2019 \u2014 Season 45 (2019)",
      "Will Ferrell, Kate McKinnon, Kyle Mooney and Heidi Gardner play a family who have won parts in a Bertucci\u2019s pizza commercial. Unfortunately for everyone, they\u2019ve offended mom right before filming.",
      "\u2018Samuel Adams\u2019 \u2014 Season 46 (2020)",
      "A commercial advertises Sam Adams\u2019 new pumpkin beer by asking \u201creal Bostonians\u201d what they think. While most of them enjoy it, a father (Bill Burr) has a much more unfiltered opinion.",
      "\u2018Amazon Go\u2019 \u2014 Season 46 (2021)",
      "A commercial advertises a new grab-and-go grocery shopping experience, but Kenan Thompson, Ego Nwodim and Punkie Johnson have suspicions. Cecily Strong has a disembodied-but-pleasant voiceover role in the side-eye of a sketch.",
      "\u2018Hot Ones with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019 \u2014 Season 46 (2021)",
      "Host Maya Rudolph does an instantly-memorable Beyonc\u00e9 impression in this sketch where she has a very hard time being interviewed on \u201cHot Ones.\u201d Host Sean Evans (Mikey Day) continually checks in on the the \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d singer after she eats an extremely hot wing.",
      "\u2018Arby\u2019s\u2019 \u2014 Season 48 (2022)",
      "A commercial for a new Arby\u2019s deal is met with deep suspicion by the customers in it. This meta-commentary on the chain\u2019s \u201cWe have the meats\u201d tagline is played to perfection by Kenan Thompson.",
      "\u2018Grimace\u2019 \u2014 Season 48 (2022)",
      "Host Miles Teller plays Grimace, the purple maybe-tastebud who surprises his fellow McDonald\u2019s mascots (played by Kenan Thompson, Mikey Day, Bowen Yang and Sarah Sherman) with a new, jacked look.",
      "\u2018Waffle House\u2019 \u2014 Season 48 (2023)",
      "Host Jenna Ortega and Marcello Hern\u00e1ndez play a couple who are having an intense but necessary conversation about their relationship outside of a Waffle House location that is bustling with activity. The sketch is a reference to the diner chain\u2019s reputation for fights, brawls and scuffles.",
      "\u2018Lisa from Temecula\u2019 \u2014 Season 48 (2023)",
      "Ego Nwodim struck comedy gold \u2014 and a recurring sketch \u2014 with the blunt and assumptive Lisa, who\u2019s in town to celebrate the birthday of her sister (Punkie Johnson).",
      "Nwodim causes host Pedro Pascal and nearly all of her scenemates to break as she aggressively attempts to cut her \u201cextra-extra-well-done\u201d steak, shaking the table and nearly knocking over everything, except for a pitcher of sangria that seems to defy gravity. Bowen Yang also bursts out laughing when Nwodim asks if people are complaining \u201c\u2019cause we Black?\u201d",
      "\u2018Chef Show\u2019 \u2014 Season 49 (2024)",
      "In this sketch, two chefs \u2014 played by Nate Bargatze and Ego Nwodim \u2014 are being judged in a food competition show to see who can cook the best soul food. The winner surprises everyone, including surprise guest and former \u201cTop Chef\u201d host Padma Lakshmi.",
      "\u2018New Barista Training\u2019 \u2014 Season 50 (2025)",
      "Host Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet plays Benny, a coffee employee who has surely watched \u201cThe Original Kings of Comedy\u201d more than once. Mikey Day, Heidi Gardner, Devon Walker, Ashley Padilla and Jane Wickline also star."

She refuses his help, before a strapping young park ranger approaches too.",

      "Now 26, Rodriguez was only 11 years old when he secured the role of Manny Delgado. Romantic and often wise beyond his years, Manny was the son of Gloria Delgado-Pritchett (Sofia Vergara) and step-son of Jay Pritchett (Ed O'Neill).",
      "Over the course of the show's 11-year run from 2009 to 2020, viewers watched Rodriguez grow up.",

      "Meghan Markle may be spending Valentine's Day away from Prince Harry, but she's sending him love from afar.",
      "On Feb. 14, Markle shared a sweet Instagram tribute to her husband of nearly seven years. She posted a black and white photo of herself smooching Harry while the couple enjoyed a meal together. In the picture, Markle holds on to her\u00a0husband\u2019s face as they share a kiss.",

      "Just days after the trailer for the show dropped, Markle revealed that the show's premiere was being delayed from Jan. 15 to March 4 in light of the wildfires in California.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thankful to my partners at Netflix for supporting me in delaying the launch, as we focus on the needs of those impacted by the wildfires in my home state of California,\u201d she said in a statement,\u00a0shared by Netflix."

      "The Season 8 participants quickly bonded over their shared love of basketball and their father\u2019s identical first names (Willy, not William), then seamlessly shifted to deeper conversations.",
      "Dodson, a 35-year-old partnership executive, lent an empathetic ear to Buckley, a 29-year-old youth director/coach, when he opened up about a difficult time in his life. But she was disappointed that he wasn\u2019t as understanding when she revealed that she had dated both women and men in the past.",
      "Ultimately, Dodson walked away from the relationship before it progressed any further, leaving Buckley to pursue his connection with Virginia Miller, a 34-year-old health care recruiter who later became his fianc\u00e9e.",

      "Why did Brittany and Devin break up?",
      "In Season 8 Episode 4, Buckley recalled a challenging time in his life during his senior year of high school where he felt extreme pain in his legs and back. Eventually, Buckley had physical therapy and surgery to address the pain and began to feel much better. Still, he admitted that he still feels \u201cashamed\u201d of abusing pain medication during that time. After listening intently, Dodson instantly reassured him that it was \u201cno reason for you to be ashamed.\u201d",
      "\"I appreciate you. I knew that if I told you, I wouldn't get any judgment,\" he replied.",
      "Dodson felt empowered to open up about her own story at this point and told Buckley about a time in her life after college where she \u201crealized things about my sexuality.\u201d",
      "Dodson said she's dated women in the past but has always seen herself marrying a man. When Buckley asked if she's still interested in women, Dodson offered the following response: \u201cI think that people are beautiful all together.\u201d",
      "Dodson then reassured him that she's always been in a monogamous relationship and is loyal to whoever she's dating \u2014 whether that's a male or a female.",
      "\u201cI feel like it's a lot for me to process just because I've never been with someone that has been with the same sex, but it doesn't change how I feel for you as a person,\u201d Dodson said.",
      "\u201cIt would've been very comforting to hear on your side, \u2018Oh, that don't matter. Oh, I don't care\u2019 but at the same time I have to understand and respect your perspective,\u201d she replied.",
      "On their next date, Dodson called things off and said, \u201cJust knowing that you may be a little more rigid than I would like in a partner, I just kind of feel like I don't think this is going to be good for me. We're not each other's person.\u201d",
      "Brittany Dodson reflects on her 'Love Is Blind' journey",
      "I\u2019ll be away, but I definitely plan to tune in.\u00a0I just have to be prepared for what other people will see.",
      "(Devin) was one of the main connections for sure.\u00a0Adam was definitely another connection, and there were a few more as well. I had a ton of fun with all the guys connecting and just chatting with them.",
      "His response didn\u2019t make me feel great in that moment, especially since I\u2019ve never thought about (my experiences with women) as a really huge deal. Then after saying it and hearing his response, I realized that it could be a bigger deal to others, including my family. So I was like, \u201cOk, here we go. Let's strap in for this ride.\u201d",
      "It definitely didn\u2019t make me feel the best, but hearing his response,  I wanted more from him, more support.\u00a0I wish that he could have had a little more confidence in himself to say, \"That doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0We\u2019re here now. Where are we going?\"",
      "In that moment I thought, \u201cLet me give him his time.\u201d But then I had time to go home and think about it and just reflect on how I responded to his situation. And in that moment, I wanted to be extremely open and understanding.",
      "I kind of made up my mind by the time I went home and came back and got a restful night. I understand, yes, you can give people time to do things, but it sounded like he already had some very clear instilled views about things.",
      "So, I thought, \u201cI can\u2019t change your mind and I don\u2019t want to be the person to change your mind.\u201d",
      "I think I never had really said it out loud. I was just like, \u201cOk,\u00a0is that kind of silly? Is it the social construct or what society has told me to do and be?\u201d Of course I am open (to being with a woman), but I do like to be in my feminine energy and I do like a big, strong, loving man to take care of me.",
      "I\u2019ve had these experiences, and I think love in general is so beautiful, so I\u2019m very open to it.",
      "I think people come into pretty much any situation with their own expectations of what the person they want to be with is going to be like. When you impose some of those views on people, you kind of mess yourself up a little bit. And again, (there are) societal norms, of course, but I think also we as people tend to just have this fairytale built up in our heads.",
      "The next cast members should be open and understand that it's 2025.\u00a0Anything is possible. Don\u2019t have this mindset that just because someone loves someone else or a different gender or anything else that it will affect how they love you.",
      "We actually didn\u2019t have any conversations about how we wanted to handle anything. Virginia was a little more closed off and kind of kept her cards close to her chest throughout filming.\u00a0She did know after I had broken up with Devin why I\u2019d broken up with him.",
      "There wasn't any room for any drama. I think we\u2019re both very classy women and we are very confident in our own right and know and understand that there's room for everybody to find love and whatever happens, happens.\u00a0We\u2019re very emotionally intelligent people too. We don\u2019t have to claw and scratch at each other for any of this.",
      "I want someone a little more seasoned \u2014\u00a0someone that can teach me something. I'm definitely not interested in holding someone\u2019s hand.",
      "Now, if I fall madly in love with and we\u2019re learning and growing together, that is such a beautiful thing. But I\u2019m not 22 years old anymore. I certainly don\u2019t want to carry the weight of a relationship.",
      "I\u2019m interested in someone that\u2019s well established, ready to be married and receive some beautiful love from me."

      "Anthony Mackie taking on the role of Captain America, a fictional comic book character initially portrayed as a white man with blond hair and blue eyes, isn\u2019t groundbreaking to comic books fans.",
      "The idea of a Black man as the patriotic superhero was introduced in 1998 by writer Mark Waid in the comic book \u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty,\u201d where, according to Waid, Sam Wilson first \u201cpicked up the costume and took on the identity of Captain America.\u201d",
      "Over two decades after Sam Wilson became Cap in the comics, a Black Captain America in the movie adaptations has turned into a contentious topic.",
      "The issue of a Black Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe first arose after Chris Evans, who portrayed Cap on-screen for eight years, passed the mantle on to Mackie\u2019s Falcon in 2019\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Endgame.\u201d Fans were upset with Evans\u2019 departure and some felt Mackie wasn\u2019t capable of taking on the superpowered role.",
      "Though some eventually warmed up to the idea after seeing him in the 2021 critically acclaimed Disney+ series, \u201cFalcon and the Winter Soldier,\u201d where Mackie\u2019s Falcon grapples with the complicated notion of what it means for a Black man to be Captain America, the vitriol against actor ramped back up during his press run for \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World.\u201d",
      "During a Q&A in January, fans threatened to boycott the film and Mackie because of his comments on what he thinks Captain America represents that some deemed unpatriotic.",
      "\u201cCaptain America represents a lot of different things, and I don\u2019t think the term \u2018America\u2019 should be one of those representations. It\u2019s about a man who keeps his word and who has honor, dignity, and integrity. Someone who is trustworthy and dependable. This is like an aspect of a dream coming true,\u201d the actor said at the time.",
      "Following the backlash, Mackie has since clarified his comments online and in interviews, saying he\u2019s a \u201cproud American,\u201d and that Captain America is \u201cimportant for kids of all races\u201d so they can have someone to look up to regardless of their race.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com about some fans\u2019 mixed reaction following the first teaser of him as Cap, Mackie, 46, says he wasn\u2019t \u201caware\u201d that a Black Captain America had become so controversial.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s funny, because we all call ourselves comic book fans, right? We all call ourselves comic book nerds, right? So if the comic book says, Sam Wilson becomes Captain America, then Sam Wilson becomes Captain America,\u201d Mackie says pragmatically.",
      "Though Mackie says he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any hesitations\u201d taking on the role in the MCU, Waid \u2014 who introduced the idea of Falcon becoming the first Black Captain America in the comics \u2014 admits there was \u201ca little bit of resistance\u201d from Marvel when he pitched it in the '90s.",
      "\u201cNot because anybody disbelieved the message,\u201d Waid, 62, tells TODAY.com. \u201cNot because anybody at Marvel was on the wrong side of history here, but just because when you\u2019re dealing with a corporate character like that it\u2019s going to go through many creators hands over his 80 years of existence.\u201d",
      "We all call ourselves comic book fans, right? We all call ourselves comic book nerds, right? So if the comic book says, Sam Wilson becomes Captain America, then Sam Wilson becomes Captain America.\u201d",
      "Anthony mackie",
      "Captain America was first created in 1941 during World War II. Since then, an array of people have held the role in the comics, including women and people of color, like Sam Wilson.",
      "Waid explains that Marvel wanted him to be careful and not\u00a0\u201ctoo extreme\u201d since that could potentially \u201calienate\u201d a huge part of their audience. \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the money comes from,\u201d he explains.",
      "But Waid\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t just to make sure the comic\u2019s core readers were satisfied, it was also to authentically portray the Black experience. To do this, the comic book writer says he spoke to his real-life Black friends who made him see a different perspective of America, which included sentiments of \u201cracial hatred\u201d and \u201cbigotry.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018There is more of this going on than you realize \u2026 so just be mindful of that as you go into the story,\u2019\u201d he recalls them saying.",
      "Within Marvel, Waid says his story of Falcon taking on the mantle of Captain America \u201cwas very well received.\u201d But externally, he says there was \u201ca little bit of pushback\u201d from fandom and readers, with some saying, \u2018\u2018Well, this is not Captain America. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d",

But he suspects that if he had done this story today, \u201cpeople would be screaming DEI at us at the top of their lungs without knowing what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Waid notes that over the last 10 to 15 years, \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot more trolling, a lot more blow back. A lot of organized fandom full of angry white guys who are not happy that they are being quote, unquote, eclipsed by people of color, which is bulls--t.\u201d",
      "If we had done this story today, people would be screaming DEI at us at the top of their lungs without knowing what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Mark Waid, writer of \u00a0\u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty\u201d",
      "The tenured comic book writer says it comes as no surprise that some fans are upset and even threatening to boycott Marvel\u2019s TV shows and the movies, because \u201cthese are the same people who were up in arms about the comics.\u201d",
      "\u201cLuckily, they have been a small enough part of the audience where we didn\u2019t have to take them into account,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we lost tons of sales because these trolls were out there being actively, performatively angry about the replacement of Captain America by a Black man in a comic book. They weren\u2019t buying the comics anyway. They were just looking for something to be mad about.\u201d",
      "Waid\u2019s introduction of Sam Wilson (Falcon) as Captain America in the comic \u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty #9\u201d unfolds in a time of \u201cgreat racial divide\u201d in America.",
      "Steve Rogers (Captain America) is trying to disassociate himself from white supremacists (Sons of Serpents) who are co-opting his name and image because they believe that Cap represents their cause, Waid explains.",
      "\u201c\u2018He\u2019s a blonde white guy with a strong jaw. He\u2019s showing you that this is what America should be,\u2019\u201d he says of their sentiments toward Rogers \u2014 who, during his fight to stop them, appears to get killed. It\u2019s at this juncture that \u201cSam Wilson realizes that someone has to pick up the mantle, someone has to pick up the shield, and someone has to fight to clear the name of Captain America.\u201d",
      "While the film is not exactly like the comics, there are similarities. The film follows Falcon\u2019s fight to uncover a villainous plot against President Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford) while also helping to exonerate Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly) \u2014 a war vet who is turned into a Super Soldier after undergoing human testings by the government \u2014 who was accused of being involved. Some fans have argued that Bradley is the first Black Captain America since he took the Super Solider serum like Cap. Mackie says Sam's sense of integrity and dedication to justice is what he leans into and tries to embody with his titular role.",
      "\u201cOne thing that I\u2019ve always wanted to portray with Sam, and make the focal point of that conversation, is the fact that he\u2019s the best part of all of us,\u201d Mackie tells TODAY.com. \u201cSam didn\u2019t take the (Super Soldier) serum. Sam isn\u2019t a Super Soldier. He\u2019s just a good human being, and I think that\u2019s why we all kind of are endeared to him and kind of appreciate him, because we can see the best of us in him.\u201d",
      "One thing that I\u2019ve always wanted to portray with Sam, and make the focal point of that conversation, is the fact that he\u2019s the best part of all of us.\"",
      "Anthony Mackie",
      "Since its first publication in March 1941, Waid says Captain America has had a simple, altruistic purpose: he represented the American dream and showed that it was attainable. But he says Cap\u2019s mission has \u201cchanged\u201d over the years.",
      "\u201cAmerica was the land of opportunity,\u201d Waid tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd clearly it has not always been that way for some people \u2026 And I think that Captain America today stands for equality. He stands for making sure that anyone in this country has an opportunity at bettering themselves and has an opportunity to have the best life possible \u2014 if they\u2019re willing to put the work into it.\u201d",
      "And Anthony Mackie has put that work in with his over two decades in Hollywood and 10 years playing Sam Wilson. Still, even with his tenure, there will still be those who take issue with there being a Black Captain America.",
      "Mackie even gave a nod to the pressure of taking on Cap\u2019s mantle in the film. In an exchange with President Ross following the attack on his life, Mackie\u2019s Sam tells the president that he overwhelmingly understands what he\u2019s going through.",
      "\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to feel you have something to prove,\u201d he says.",

      "\u201cIf I\u2019m not on point, I let everyone who wants a seat at that table down,\u201d he says to his First Lieutenant Joaquin Torres (Danny Ramirez), who takes on Sam's former mantle of Falcon. \u201cThat\u2019s pressure. It makes you feel that you\u2019re not enough.\u201d",
      "The \"Captain America\" comic book writer says there\u2019s always been room\u00a0for the character to change, evolve and represent something more inclusive.",
      "\u201cCaptain America can be an Asian man. Captain America can be a woman. Captain America could be anyone who stands for the ideals that Captain America stands for,\u201d Waid explains, noting that he hopes Cap\u2019s fight eventually \u201cgets easier.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs long as they\u2019re an American at heart and fight for the American way \u2026 the way we wish truly was the dream as opposed to what racism and bigotry has sort of poisoned that well.\u201d",
      "Mackie agrees, noting that his Captain America leads with two important things: \u201cCompassion and empathy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like today, we could all use a little compassion and empathy,\u201d he adds."

      "Before actor Monica Barbaro had the chance to meet Joan Baez \u2014 the iconic folk singer she portrayed in \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d \u2014 she received a special message from her.",
      "Barbaro, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her role as Baez in the film, tells TODAY.com that while she had texted with the singer before the release of the film, it was a voicemail from Baez, 84, that ended up making her emotional.",
      "\u201cWhen she saw it, she left me the most wonderful voicemail that I got on Golden Globes weekend, and fully just brought me to tears,\u201d Barbaro says. \u201cLike always, to hear her voice \u2014 had that effect on me. And then, and she said wonderful things about my performance, and about Timmy, and about Ed and the movie, and that was wonderful.\u201d",
      "Directed by James (Jim) Mangold, Barbaro stars alongside Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Bob Dylan, Edward Norton as Pete Seeger and Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, in the critically-acclaimed biopic that centers on Dylan\u2019s early beginnings as an artist.",
      "\u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d scooped up eight Academy Award nominations, including best picture, since its release on Dec. 25. Barbaro says prior to Baez seeing the movie, she sent her a text that not only helped her prepare for the \u201ceventuality\u201d of the film\u2019s success, but also her first real encounter with the singer.",
      "\u201cShe was just really cool about it, like I could tell she wasn\u2019t going to tell me that she liked it, just to be nice or anything, you know \u2014she\u2019s not that kind of person,\u201d Barbaro says of their correspondence.",
      "On Feb. 8 \u2014 over a month after the film premiered in theaters \u2014 the pair got to meet in person for the first time at Baez\u2019s performance at a benefit concert in San Francisco.",
      "\u201cIt was just great to hug her and see her. I thought it would be overwhelming, but it felt kind of, familial, like it was really nice,\u201d Barbaro says. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ll see her again.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe was really present and lovely with me, and was like, \u2018When are you landing? What are you (doing) when is all of this over?\u2019\u201d Barbaro continues. \u201cI think she understands probably better than anyone, how much of a whirlwind moments like this can be.\u201d",
      "The 34-year-old actor adds it was \u201camazing\u201d to get to see Baez perform live, after learning how to play guitar and sing the performer\u2019s songs in the film.",
      "\u201cI obviously am very well acquainted with how talented she is, but I just didn\u2019t expect for her voice to be still, so smooth and powerful as it is in her 80s,\u201d Barbaro says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, absolutely incredible. And her stage presence \u2014 she\u2019s so funny, and she just made the crowd, I think, feel really seen.\u201d",
      "What Baez has said about Barbaro\u2019s performance in \u2018A Complete Unknown\u2019",
      "Baez first spoke publicly about \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d in an interview published in the Marin Independent Journal in Jan.",
      "\u201cI loved what she did in the film,\u201d Baez told the Journal about Barbaro\u2019s performance. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t think she was good at it, I probably wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it in general. But she looked enough like me and she had my gestures down. You could tell who it was. She worked so hard. Kudos to her for taking the role on.\u201d",
      "Barbaro tells TODAY.com she appreciated Baez publicly speaking out about her performance, because she hasn\u2019t wanted to share what the singer has told her privately.",
      "\u201cI feel very protective of the things she says to me in private, and so it was just really generous of her to then have opened up to the press and said that because nobody has to do that,\u201d Barbaro says.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen a lot of biopics and a lot of characters portrayed, and a lot of responses that are not so positive, or even with a good performance, sometimes people can feel really attached to how a story maybe got something wrong, and she just had a really wonderful way of giving this film over to us.\u201d",
      "In Baez\u2019s interview with the Journal, she also praised Chalamet\u2019s performance as Dylan in the movie (though she did say she remembered the real-life Dylan as a lot scruffier than Chalamet).",
      "\u201cI have to come back to that\u2019s how it was,\u201d Baez said. \u201cWhen he walked into the room, he took up all the oxygen. And so my part was always diminished in his presence. And in that sense the film is accurate.\u201d",
      "Those seemingly authentic moments between Barbaro\u2019s Baez and Chalamet\u2019s Dylan in the film came somewhat naturally to the actors. Barbaro says she didn\u2019t have many conversations with Chalamet prior to their scenes together as the two chose to trust in each other\u2019s abilities.",
      "\u201cTimmy and I didn\u2019t plan anything, and we didn\u2019t really talk much before we came in and did our scenes,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a testament to how much we trusted Jim as a director, and then also trust each other \u2014 trusted each other\u2019s versions of these people.\u201d",
      "She recalls the first scene they shot together, a concert scene in Pittsburgh where Dylan leaves Baez alone on stage.",
      "\u201cHe was improvising as Bob,\u201d Barbaro says of Chalamet. \u201cAnd he just was so clearly locked into Bob\u2019s language and energy. And I just trusted it completely. And I think he trusted me as Joan and we just sort of like, let that dynamic fly.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we just deeply understood these people as best as we could, and then we therefore came up with something authentic,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd the way Jim chose to film it and edit it, I think was indicative of his understanding of their overall dynamic.\u201d",
      "As a first-time Oscar nominee, Monica Barbaro is taking it all in",
      "It\u2019s been less than a month since \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d was nominated for eight Oscars, and Barbaro says it\u2019s been \u201ccrazy\u201d ever since it was announced she was up for best supporting actress.",
      "When asked about her chances to win the coveted award, the actor says she \u201cdefinitely\u201d doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll win. Instead, she prefers to root for others.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m fans of everybody in the category. I can\u2019t believe my name is among them in this way \u2014 even just being shortlisted, was like, \u2018Woah. What do you mean?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been absolutely magical, and everyone\u2019s so wonderful to me,\u201d she continues. \u201cI just feel really honored. It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s really cool to be among the eight that we have for this film.\u201d",
      "As the March 2 date for the 97th Academy Awards approaches, Barbaro says she\u2019s still trying to take it all in and not let imposter syndrome get the best of her.",

    "summary": "Alex Brown talks about his breakup with Madison Errichiello on Season 8 of Love Is Blind, what happened with Mason and why they split.",
    "story": [
      "Alex Brown is planning to tune in to Season 8 of \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d but he\u2019s admittedly nervous to watch the action unfold on the small screen after living it firsthand last year.",
      "\u201cI might be in bed just crying alone when I watch it. I don\u2019t know yet,\u201d the commercial real estate broker said while speaking to TODAY.com ahead of the premiere.",
      "It\u2019s understandable why the 29-year-old is cautiously awaiting his TV debut. After all, it\u2019s not every day that you watch yourself navigate a love triangle. But that\u2019s exactly what Brown encountered when he entered the \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d dating pods.",
      "Madison Errichiello, one of 32 Minneapolis singles on the latest season of \u201cLove Is Blind, was torn between Brown and another contestant, Mason Horacek.",
      "While drawn to Errichiello, Brown was also wary of an engagement given their experiences with conflict. Errichiello admitted that she had an avoidant attachment style and often \u201cdissociates\u201d when faced with a challenge. Brown, who said he was more anxiously attached, acknowledged Errichiello\u2019s approach was a \u201ctrigger\u201d for him since it reminded him of past relationships and \u201ccould lead to some issues.\u201d",
      "The two finally split up over Errichiello\u2019s reaction to what happened between her and Horacek. After first committing to her, he decided to pursue a connection with another woman, Meg Fink (who turned him down). Despite wanting to be with Brown, Errichiello was offended that Horacek was so quick to backtrack from his initial sentiment. Then, when she told Brown how she was feeling, he said he understood \u201cboth perspectives,\u201d which seemed to escalate Errichiello\u2019s annoyance.",
      "After she seemed to retreat emotionally, the topic of avoidance came up again and Brown expressed his concern that they had two very different communication styles. Ultimately, he decided to walk away from the relationship.",
      "Thanks to love triangles like Brown\u2019s, this season spent a particularly long time in the pod stage \u2014 six full episodes. At this point in the season, five couples are together. Two, like Brown and Errichiello, split in the pods.",
      "Below, Brown analyzes his drawn-out breakup with Errichiello, their love triangle and more.",
      "I went into that final date truly 50/50, not knowing if I was going to propose or end things. It was a really big moment when all that went down. At that point, I still had hope that I was going to propose in the next couple hours. It really shook both of us, I think, when we had that disagreement. It was definitely a tough moment for me.",
      "I think (Madison) and I were clearly on different pages in a couple different ways. I haven\u2019t seen the episodes yet, but what had been discussed several times is attachment styles.",
      "I think her and I are different attachment styles. I think it just is very apparent as the show goes on and as we progressed in the dates.",
      "I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy.",
      "There just wasn\u2019t enough time at that point to figure out if that communication gap was going to be an issue or if we could overcome it or not. And I think it was just too much in the moment for us to move forward.",
      "I guess I try to stay along the same principles of finding someone that matches my attachment style or is as secure as possible. I\u2019ve worked so hard in so many years to build myself up to a point where I feel like I\u2019m in a secure attachment style. I know the effort that that took and I want to find someone that has also put in the effort.",
      "I think I just look for those signs that they\u2019re not gonna fight me or run away or all the things that I used to do and that people that I\u2019ve been with have done in the past. I just want to be in a healthy relationship as much as possible.",
      "I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen.",
      "I\u2019m always going to have empathy for others no matter what the situation is, so I\u2019m definitely glad that I stuck to my guns and had empathy. Maybe that wasn\u2019t the right move in the situation. Maybe it was. But I think from my perspective, it was the right move.",
      "I just honestly, sincerely felt bad for Mason because I saw him 10 minutes before that crying into my arms. Basically, he\u2019s sitting there heartbroken. And then it\u2019s hard to walk into the date (with Madison) and have someone just really talk negatively about him.",
      "So that it was hard for me and I just wanted to give him some of the benefit of the doubt while also trying to understand her perspective as well. Maybe I didn\u2019t do a good job. Maybe I did. I haven\u2019t seen the show yet, so I don\u2019t really remember. It\u2019s been a year now.",
      "I think my ideal partner would be someone who is very open-minded, someone who is adventurous, someone who\u2019s very kind and will stay by my side and be kind and be there for me and have some fun adventures together.",
      "I feel like I really understand how to get deeper with someone and to kind of forget about the appearances and the more surface level things. It allows me to get deeper with people and not really focus on those things anymore. So that\u2019s been a really big impact on my life. From friends to family, I\u2019ve been able to get a lot closer to people and feel more vulnerable."

Written by Bob Odenkirk, this genius sketch that singularly sums up \"SNL's\" comedy magic to a tee.

      "\u201cSNL\u201d turned comedy into a kind of rock and roll, so it was only fitting that lovable, burned out rock fans Wayne and Garth welcomed Aerosmith to their little cable access show in what may be the quintessential \u201cWayne\u2019s World\u201d sketch, from Season 15 in 1990. \u201cWayne\u2019s World\u201d was a smash sketch that later became a hit movie. Getting Aerosmith to play along here (the bit where the band debates the future of communism is fantastic) made sense in much the same way it made people laugh. This sketch also gets bonus points for frequent host Tom Hanks playing a dedicated roadie.",
      "\u2014 D.W.",
      "This piece from Season 16 in 1990 was an instant classic. Patrick Swayze parlayed the moves he showed off a few years earlier in \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d by going toe-to-toe with Chris Farley as two men competing for one spot to be a Chippendales dancer. Swayze has the seductive moves and Farley is a slovenly mess, but we\u2019re to believe it\u2019s a dead heat as they perform. Swayze was the sex symbol, but it\u2019s Farley we can\u2019t stop watching. The sketch takes itself very seriously, which is what makes it even funnier \u2014 that and the fact that it\u2019s Farley at his physically comedic best.",

      "The \"Christimas Party\u201d skit featuring her character Sue was a running joke among my group of friends growing up, especially when it comes to the cheese ball! Her \u201cexcitement,\" aka anxiety, is hilarious, and as I\u2019ve gotten older, realize it\u2019s somewhat relatable! Just ... to the extreme.",

      "In my opinion, the best \"Celebrity Jeopardy\" sketch of all time. This is Macdonald at his all-time wackiest, changing his name to \u201cTurd Fergeson\u201d and making Will Ferrell as Trebek call him the name for the entire episode, which catches on for future sketches. Hammond as Connery is also a staple of the series and a perfectly appropriate over-the-top impression of the actor. He insults Trebek the entire episode, writing, \u201cSuck it, Trebek!\u201d for his final Jeopardy answer. Ferrell\u2019s reactions and demeanor as Trebek when talking to the clueless celebrities are perfect.",

In the sketch, Boseman reprises his \"Black Panther\" role of King T\u2019Challa and, like the other contestants, responds to statements as it relates to their Black culture. One of the now viral clues in the \u201cBlack Jeopardy!\u201d category of \u201cWhite People,\u201d centered around a \u201cKaren\u201d bringing her potato salad to a Black person\u2019s cookout. Bosemen\u2019s humorous and culturally relatable response as T\u2019Challa immediately became a meme.

He agreed and continued to pursue Virginia, who had been reserved and skeptical during many of their conversations.",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a sweet letter to Virginia expressing his feelings. \u201cVirginia, you are the most kind, loving and genuine person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he praised. \u201cI know that in your past relationships, they made you feel insecure and undervalued. But I promise to always make you feel valued, loved, and to make you feel like the queen that you are.\u201d",
      "At the end of his letter, he told Virginia he loved her and asked her to marry him. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d she softly replied. She later told the cameras through tears, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this ever. I just feel amazing. Today\u2019s a good day.\u201d",
      "Daniel and Taylor",
      "Daniel Hastings and Taylor Haag matched each other\u2019s energy from their first conversation. He joked about proposing a few minutes into their chat and she playfully went along. When she returned to gush with the girls, Taylor, a 32-year-old colonoscopy nurse, said she appreciated that Daniel, a 30-year-old sales account executive, repeatedly spoke about searching for the mother of his kids.",
      "They also bonded over their love of Christmas. In Episode 5, they gifted each other Christmas ornaments and stockings and marveled over their similarities. \u201cThe Christmas thing means a lot to me,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cBut even if it wasn\u2019t Christmas stuff, I feel like we were meant to find each other.\u201d",

      "David and Lauren",
      "David \u201cDave\u201d Bettenburg and Lauren O\u2019Brien were one of many Season 8 contestants who were involved in a love triangle. Dave, a 33-year-old medical device salesman, couldn\u2019t determine if he had stronger feelings for Lauren or Molly Mulaney. When Lauren, a 31-year-old education saleswoman, realized Dave was undecided, she revealed to him that she didn\u2019t have any other connections.",
      "Meanwhile, Molly anxiously waited for Dave to call it quits with Lauren and solely pursue her. But in Episode 5, Dave cried as he told Molly that he wanted to \u201csee things through\u201d with Lauren instead. Molly was hurt but said she knew if he didn\u2019t want her then it wasn\u2019t meant to be.",
      "Dave then met with Lauren. She said although they had some tough conversations she appreciated that they were open with each other and were able to move past everything.",

      "Joey Leveille and Monica Danus\u2019 time in the pods was drama-free. Joey, a 35-year-old physician associate, and Monica, a 28-year-old digital marketer, seemed to only form a bond with each other. They quickly connected thanks to their bubbly and quirky personalities and their love for \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d Joey also supported Monica when she revealed that she was between jobs because she needed to take time off to help her family.",
      "By Episode 2, they already knew that they wanted to get engaged and leave the pods together, making them the first official couple of Season 8.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve had an incredible time falling in love with who you are as a person, your laugh, your voice, and I would love to take the next step with you,\u201d Joey said.",

      "Ben and Sara",

In Episode 2, Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, asked Ben, a 28-year-old developer, about growing up in a Christian household. He explained his beliefs before she revealed that she wasn\u2019t religious.",

      "\u201cYeah, no discomfort around that community at all,\u201d he replied. She felt confident in their connection, but when they met again in Episode 4, she had some more concerns. She mentioned Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of ignorant towards that stuff. Like, I didn\u2019t vote in the last election. As long as I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not going to do much, so\u2026\u201d Ben said. When she asked directly about BLM, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not one way or the other. I just kind of keep out of it.\u201d",
      "Sara replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very valuable and important to think about those things.\u201d\u00a0 She later said she didn\u2019t like his responses to her questions. \u201cBasic human rights, equality, I need someone to be on the same page with me about that,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben assured her in Episode 5 that their values aligned. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any burden or any weight on your shoulder thinking that you have to teach me because I do have that motivation to grow into that and that internal feeling that we do have the same beliefs in these things,\u201d he said before proposing.",

      "The two seemed headed for an engagement until Madison revealed she had an avoidant attachment style. Alex suddenly became less talkative and their conversation ended abruptly.",
      "When they met again, Alex voiced his concerns that Madison would run if they faced an obstacle. She told him that her still being in the experiment was proof that she was ready to go through challenging times with him. Meanwhile, Madison was also building a connection with Mason Horacen.",
      "Mason told Madison he was \u201ccommitted\u201d to her. But when Madison decided to pursue her relationship with Alex instead, Mason regretted what he said. In Episode 6, Madison explained the situation to Alex.",
      "Alex said he sympathized with Mason and wished him well. Madison didn\u2019t appreciate that Alex wasn\u2019t more comforting toward her.\u00a0 After their tense conversation, Alex said he could see a future with her but he was worried they would struggle with communication and disagreements. \u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s a pretty big jump. We\u2019re not at a point to get engaged,\u201d he said.",
      "Madison tearfully departed the pods and left the experiment.",
      "Mason and Meg",
      "Mason, a 33-year-old cinematographer, gravitated toward Meg Fink, a 31-year-old oncology nurse, in the pods. She shared her conspiracy theories with him and expressed her strong feelings. But she knew that Mason also had a connection with Madison.",
      "After Madison ended things with Mason, she told Meg what happened. Meg confronted Mason in the pods at the end of Episode 5. She questioned if she was only there by \u201cdefault\u201d because Madison rejected him.",
      "He said he validated the \u201cwrong person\u201d because he was \u201cconfused\u201d at the time.",
      "When he said she was always his first choice, Meg replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t yesterday, just to be fair.\u201d She said he never affirmed his feelings for her until it was too late.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll never know if what you\u2019re saying is true because we don\u2019t get the opportunity for you to pick,\u201d she told him in Episode 6. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to get past that.\u201d",

      "Season 2, Episode 12, out Feb. 13, flashes back to the moment Gabi, played by Shanola Hampton, and Sir, portrayed by Mark-Paul Gosselaar, came face to face about 20 years after he kidnapped her. Viewers see Gabi intend to kill Sir, hoping to end her years of suffering and fear, before he changes her mind. He pitches that the two collaborate on her M&A cases, allowing their toxic, unbreakable bond to continue.",
      "A majority of the episode, titled \"Missing While Misidentified,\" is set in the past while in the present, both Gabi and Sir are arrested and questioned separately by the police.",

      "She adds, \u201cTo see that rage and that passion of why she did what she did, it was just so fun to do and I was so excited to play it.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s a question that people have asked about the first season. Like, \u2018Was he able to escape? How did he escape? Did he want to escape?\u2019 So I think we get a glimpse of that in Episode 212,\u201d he shares.",
      "Below, the two stars unpack all the secrets that were revealed in Season 2, Episode 12 in a joint interview with TODAY.com \u2014 and why Sir and Gabi's relationship is a dynamic \"we have not seen play out on television before.\"",
      "Gosselaar: It\u2019s been lovely. This has been just a great season. The fact that I don\u2019t have to be in the same room as you for so many hours.",
      "Hampton: That\u2019s what I was going to say, too. You know how you go on \"Love Is Blind\" and you want to switch your answer to \"no\" after they say \"No\" (at the altar)?",
      "Gosselaar: Honestly, I do enjoy the scenes that Sir has with Gabrielle in Episode 212 \u2014 we go back to the origin. It\u2019s fun to watch the dynamic between the two characters. And there\u2019s just so much going on, right? So it\u2019s fun to shoot and it\u2019s fun to watch.",
      "Hampton: I make no secret that I get to work with wonderful actors on this show. But my scenes with Mark-Paul, they lift me. And when he\u2019s there and he\u2019s present, on a personal level, it lifts me. So, not having as much interaction this season was really a bit of a shock to my system, because I got so used to it Season 1. I relied on those days as an escape day for me, and so not having that was quite an adjustment. Truthfully, that\u2019s how I feel about it. And hopefully in Season 3 we will be back on the screen together a lot!",
      "Gosselaar: How did it happen? I think that\u2019s a big question of the first season. How did she abduct Sir? Why is he in her basement? Somebody had to help. Who helped her? All those questions get answered. And for us, as fans of our show, that was fun to read and fun to do. We always end on a cliffhanger. That\u2019s by design. The next script for us, we just can\u2019t wait to get into it. So we\u2019re sort of mirroring what the audience is going through, just in a different way.",
      "Hampton: This is my favorite episode that I\u2019ve ever shot on the show. To be able to answer some of the questions from Season 1 in this episode, to see the mindset, to play the dynamics and the nuances of dealing with Margaret (Kelli Williams) while making this choice, and to see Dhan\u2019s (Karan Oberoi) part in it. All of these things where it just was so juicy to me. To see that rage and that passion of why she did what she did, it was just so fun to do and I was so excited to play it. I like seeing Gabi here, because I think the audience gets to really go on the ride that she went through in a real way.",
      "Hampton: I think it\u2019s telling to the psychological damage that one does to the victim and how hard it is to break the cycle. Our central theme is not to judge people\u2019s healing process. People are so quick to say, \"Just block them, girl! Don\u2019t talk to him anymore!\" Everybody has advice until they\u2019re there. Now, she can search why and really heal so that when she does press block, if that time ever comes, it\u2019s out of a place of healing. That was really a telling moment, I think, for Gabi, for me as the actor playing Gabi, and for the audience to see, \"Oh, this goes way deeper than we even think.\"",
      "Gosselaar: I just think it reinforced that a lot of the time that Sir is there by choice. That\u2019s a question that people have asked about the first season. Like, \"Was he able to escape? How did he escape? Did he want to escape?\" So I think we get a glimpse of that in Episode 212.",
      "Hampton: Sick. It\u2019s an obsession of sorts. There\u2019s no real definition. We\u2019ve not really seen this dynamic play out on television before. So to have it not be a sexual chemistry or him wanting to marry her, wifey her up \u2014 you just see him wanting a life with her. So it\u2019s weird.",
      "Gosselaar: There\u2019s so many things. We don\u2019t choose family, so I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s why he uses that word. That even years can go by and because you have the bond of family, it\u2019s an unbreakable bond. So I think he\u2019s very particular in the words that he chooses. But \"family\" is deep and it\u2019s really dark. I guess that\u2019s what people come to our show for.",
      "Hampton: Well, it shows that it\u2019s going to be a disconnect. This means a lot less time of them being in the same room. Gabi (is) putting a line in the sand, saying, \"I\u2019m not giving into his manipulation.\" It sets up the next several episodes of what the dynamic is going to be with Sir and Gabi.",
      "Gosselaar: We\u2019re just going to see moments where the lack of control is going to eat at him. You\u2019re just going to see him do everything in his power to connect.",
      "Gosselaar: We have a great group of actors, very talented. There\u2019s a few stinkers. Actually, just one. But I won\u2019t name names, because that wouldn\u2019t be fair to the other actors. We are a very ambitious show. We\u2019ve said this before: we have 44 minutes to tell a story, and this story is just packed with plot and characters. It was very difficult to get this all on screen. We did, and we have just an unbelievable crew that works their butt off every single day of our show for the nine months that we\u2019re filming. So my hat goes off to them. We have great writers and everyone working behind us and all the actors. It is truly a collaboration that couldn\u2019t be done with one of the parts missing. Thankfully we don\u2019t have any parts missing, and it just makes for a great show. I hope we can continue with Season 3. Maybe I\u2019ll just have to have a conversation with that actor that was slowing things down.",
      "Hampton: That actor says that she has in her contract not to speak to her or look her in the eyes, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. (laughs)",
      "Hampton: It\u2019s awful. So what people don\u2019t understand is that Mark-Paul is the lead on this show, but he doesn\u2019t work. So it\u2019s one day a week, which means I only have to stomach him one day. When he\u2019s directing, he\u2019s gotta prep. His presence is there. He has to direct all eight days. You know what eight days is like being with Mark-Paul? No, it was amazing.",
      "Gosselaar: Actually, I was there for a lot longer. We went through a hurricane together. I was there for three weekends. I was like, \"What is going on here? I\u2019ve never worked so hard in my life!\"",
      "Hampton: What I\u2019ll say about Mark-Paul as a director, and this is for future projects as well, what you\u2019re going to get is someone who is intellectually prepared, technically prepared, but also able to be really chill when things need to change. He has so much experience on set. He is a leader of not only the cast but the crew. He commands trust on day one, and he\u2019s a joy. I mean, he is a stick in the mud. And yes, you would think he\u2019s boring and a jerk. But he\u2019s actually super funny, and people enjoy being around him. I\u2019m not one of those people. He is one of the five directors that I would work with for the rest of my career and be happy.",
      "Hampton: I think it\u2019s that they thought they were just going to get another procedural, and then there was a man in the basement. You start the ride and you cannot get off, because you have to see what\u2019s going to happen with these two characters while serving the communities who are underserved. So I think that\u2019s where the connection has happened.",
      "Gosselaar: I agree. I like how you started that off. Because it\u2019s like the audience thought they were just going to get Shanola, and then they got Mark-Paul Gosselaar.",
      "Hampton: (laughs) Not what I said, Sir!",
      "Gosselaar: Pretty much. You said the procedural and then you were, like, \"Then the guy in the basement.\" I totally agree with that.",
      "Hampton: I mean, how many Critics Choice nominations did you get before working with me? You\u2019re welcome.",
      "Gosselaar: Same as you. (laughs)",

But when he suggested the group question if the three newcomers \u2014 Rob, Wes and Derrick \u2014 were possible Traitors, Rob took it as an opportunity stab the \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" winner in the back. Rob convinced the group to banish Bob, stunning him. After being voted out, Rob stood before the cast and proudly confirmed he had lied and was a Traitor.",
      "Robyn Dixon",
      "After a roaring roundtable that resulted in one of their own being exposed, the remaining Traitors plotted in Episode 5 to murder someone who would draw suspicion away from them. They debated back and forth, with one Traitor failing to be heard. Ultimately, they decided that murdering Robyn Dixon would add to the confusion permeating throughout the castle. When \"The Real Housewives of Potomac\" star learned she had been eliminated, she said, \"I knew it was coming because I am a threat to the Traitors.\" In her parting words, she advised the Traitors to \"work harder\" after losing Bob the Drag Queen.",
      "Nikki Garcia",
      "Nikki Garcia was living on borrowed time in the castle after the Traitors set up her inevitable downfall. After being selected as one of the three contestants to lie in the coffin in Episode 4, the rest of the contestants assumed that at least one cast member chosen was a Traitor. The former WWE star deflected suspicion at first, but in Episode 5, one of her closest allies, Chrishell Stause, started to doubt her. Chrishell voiced her concerns about Nikki during the roundtable, leading most of the group to vote her out. \"The win for me is that I do get to go home to my son. The loss for all of you is that I'm a Faithful,\" Nikki said as she left.",
      "Bob Harper",
      "As Episode 6 began, the trust between the Traitors was at an all time low.  They met in the turret and discussed their \"dysfunctional family\" before listing their targets. They settled on Bob Harper, who was vocal at the most recent roundtable about who the Faithfuls couldn't trust. The three remaining Traitors labeled him as \"the more imminent threat\" and agreed to murder him. When \"The Biggest Loser\" trainer didn't show up for breakfast the next morning, the cast, excluding the Traitors, were stunned. After Bob H. read his letter from the Traitors, he said, \"No f---ing way. I think the Traitors are playing a really ballsy game. They're very invincible right now because they are so hidden. I'm angry. I'm just angry over the train of thought of why I was murdered. I hate the Traitors.\"",
      "Wes Bergmann",
      "At the end of the Episode 6, Wes Bergmann planned to turn on Rob, but the \"Survivor\" winner beat him to it. Throughout the episode, Wes had been suggesting Rob's name to multiple people. When everyone arrived at the roundtable, Rob used Wes' scheming ways against him and pointed out that Wes pushed for Nikki to be banished. To defend himself, Wes warned that he would target anyone who voted against him. His tactic didn't work and pushed the Faithfuls in the opposite direction, making them vote to banish him. \"The Challenge\" star delivered one of his signature boastful speeches before he left, calling himself \"one of the greatest reality competition players of all time.\" He added, \"I don't care about any of you. You are all chess pieces on a board. And so to all those people that have died until I got to this circle right here, I have no idea who killed them because I'm a Faithful.\"",
      "Derrick Levasseur",
      "Derrick Levasseur took a chance during the roundtable in Episode 6 and voiced his theory about Rob being a traitor. The next episode, his boldness came back to bite him. When the Traitors met in secret at the beginning of Episode 7, they begrudgingly decided the \"Big Brother\" winner needed to go to help rebuild trust between them. As Derrick learned his fate, he was unsurprised. \"I knew that after I called out Rob directly last night, and he chose to instead go at Wes, that he was not going to give me another roundtable, which I guess I have to take as a compliment,\" Derrick said. He proudly added, \"I'm the most dangerous person in here for the Traitors, and they know it.\" He said he would have made the same move and that he was \"honored\" to have been a part of the season.",
      "Rob 'Boston Rob' Mariano",
      "Rob's smooth-talking and cunning ways could no longer save him by Episode 7. Before he departed, Derrick planted seeds to his fellow Faithfuls, cautioning them that Rob was a Traitor. At breakfast, Rob posed the theory that the Traitors had murdered Derrick to make the \"Survivor\" star look guilty. But \"Vanderpump Rules\" star Tom Sandoval was unconvinced and realized that it was the third time a Faithful was murdered after publicly going against Rob. So, Tom presented that evidence during the roundtable, hoping that others would jump on board. After everyone voted, Rob received a majority of votes \u2014 including two from his fellow Traitors \u2014 and was banished, ending his masterful run this season. \"First of all, I just want to tell all of you that I have really enjoyed meeting you and playing this game with you. I've had a ton of fun,\" he said during his final speech. \"I am, and always have been, from the very beginning, a Traitor.\"",
      "Chrishell Stause",
      "At the start of Episode 8, Chrishell Stause was one of the few remaining players that did not secure a shield in the previous mission. So, she had to dress to the nines and go to the chapel to learn if the Traitors decided to murder her. While the other vulnerable players turned around and saw Cumming waiting for them near the pews, Chrishell came face to face with the two remaining Traitors. The \"Selling Sunset\" star seemed slightly shocked as she discovered the Traitors' identities. They explained that she would've never been banished, so they needed to eliminate her. \"That's unfortunate,\" Chrishell simply said. In her final confessional interview, she said that all of the Faithfuls had been \"idiots\" and that one particular Traitor was \"playing the best game.\" She added, \"I wasn't ready to leave. But, if I must go, I appreciate the fabulous send off.\"",
      "Ciara Miller",
      "The remaining Faithfuls desperately searched for any evidence that could point them in the direction of a Traitor. Sam Asghari suggested that the group revisit the theory that one of the Traitors was in the coffins in Episode 3. With Jeremy murdered and Nikki banished, that left Ciara as the only possible option. At the round table in Episode 8, Ciara explained that her passionate speech after she was placed in the coffin was an example of her pleading for her life in the game. She also tried to cast doubt on two contestants. But, the other players did not trust her and all voted to banish the \"Summer House\" star. \"I don't really do speeches, but I'll always go down fighting. I'm never succumbing to anyone,\" she said during her final remarks. \"Even the Traitors, because I am a Faithful.\""

They weren\u2019t taking it light-hearted.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that it would be \u201cvery, very, very difficult\u201d for Ukraine to survive without U.S. military support, both now as it tries to repel Russia's invasion and in the future after the war ends.",
      "\"Probably it will be very, very, very difficult. And of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance,\" Zelenskyy told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. \"But we will have low chance, low chance, to survive without support of the United States. I think it\u2019s very important, critical.\"",
      "\"I don\u2019t want to think about\" fighting against Russia without American support, Zelenskyy told \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker.",
      "\"I don\u2019t want to think that we will not be strategic partners,\" he added.",
      "The Ukrainian president also spoke about his concern that Ukraine would be vulnerable to another major attack by Russia in the future if the U.S. does not continue providing military support.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to come to the negotiating table not to end the war but to get a ceasefire deal that would lift certain international sanctions on Russia and would allow its military to regroup.",
      "\"This is really what he wants. He wants pause, prepare, train, take off some sanctions, because of ceasefire and et cetera,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "Zelenskyy's comments came during a fractious summit in Germany, where Vice President JD Vance\u00a0criticized European leaders on a host of issues unrelated to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, including failing to stand up for \u201cvalues shared with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier presented his own unvarnished view in response, saying that the Trump administration had \u201cno regard for established rules, partnership and grown trust.\u201d",
      "The widening gulf between Europe and the United States comes at an especially delicate time for Zelenskyy and an exhausted and depleted Ukraine. While the war appears to have descended into a quagmire, Russian forces have been making slow if painful progress. Russia controls some 20% of the country, which is in dire need of weapons and soldiers.",
      "Ukraine and its supporters always knew that the incoming White House would take a vastly different tack from former President Joe Biden, who backed Ukrainian victory while sometimes not giving Kyiv all the weapons it wanted in its fight against Russia.",
      "But the words and actions of Trump and his surrogates this week have stunned and even appalled many in Europe, where it\u2019s widely held that it is not in the West's interest to not hand Russia a win in Ukraine.",
      "Vance's speech felt like he was trying \"to pick a fight with us, and we don\u2019t want to a pick a fight with our friends,\" E.U. foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said at the Munich summit.",
      "But officials and experts fear Trump risks doing just that, with the president this week appearing to prioritize Putin over Zelenskyy or European allies in any potential peace talks. Trump's administration also floated major concessions to Putin \u2014 including giveaways on Ukrainian territory and dismissing any hope that it may join NATO.",
      "Zelenskyy has kept a brave face, but has little choice to do otherwise, some observers say. He recently told The Economist that he did not believe the U.S. had a \"ready plan\" for peace, while remaining adamant he would reject any agreement negotiated between Washington and Moscow without his involvement.",
      "Trump \"is a strong man,\" the Ukrainian leader said Friday during a panel discussion at the conference with U.S. senators. \"And if he will choose our side, and if he will not be in the middle, I think he will pressure and he will push Putin to stop the war. He can do it.\"",
      "Though Trump signaled little for Ukraine in return, Vance offered some succor to Kyiv and its European neighbors, suggesting in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that Moscow could face sanctions and other penalties.",
      "\u201cThere are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,\u201d Vance told the newspaper. \u201cThere are any number of formulations, of configurations, but we do care about Ukraine having sovereign independence.\u201d",
      "Europe is not just worried about Ukraine but fears what Putin might do next if he\u2019s seen to be rewarded after his invasion there. European intelligence agencies say Russia could attack a NATO ally in the next five years if it believes the alliance has been weakened \u2014 as Trump is often accused of doing.",
      "Russia\u2019s three-year-old invasion is the bloodiest European conflict since World War II, reviving scenes of trench warfare and tank battles that some scholars believed were consigned to history. As many as 1 million people have died, according to NATO estimates, including hundreds of thousands of both Ukrainian and Russian soldiers.",
      "The alliance believes an average of 10,000 people have been killed or injured every week in the frigid, cratered fields of eastern Ukraine."

      "The Islamist group\u2019s radical ideology was never fully defeated, and after the ouster of longtime Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad late last year, as well as the arrival of a new administration in Washington, some are fearful that ISIS could be unleashed on the world once again.",
      "'Army in detention'",
      "In northern Syria, around 10,000 alleged ISIS fighters are locked away in 28 jails, the largest of which is Al Sina Prison on the edge of the small city of Hasakah.",
      "Crowded in the drab, concrete prison are thousands of men, many of them captured on the battlefield during ISIS\u2019 last stand in 2019, who sit or lie around in tattered brown jailhouse uniforms, dozens in each cell.",
      "Among them is Ibrahim, a Moroccan national who admitted in an interview with NBC News late last month that he was an ISIS fighter but insisted that he was no longer a threat.",
      "\u201cIf I were dangerous, I would not have surrendered myself,\u201d said Ibrahim, who declined to give his last name. \u201cI just want to go back to my county.\u201d",
      "Imprisoned for six years, he is one of the many foreign detainees whose home countries have failed to repatriate them.",
      "For the SDF commander, Gen. Mazloum Abdi, these prisoners are among the most dangerous. \u201cThey are hard-liners,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have massive numbers in our prisons, and this constitutes an ongoing threat.\u201d",
      "That threat was brought sharply into focus just over three years ago when ISIS launched a large attack on Al Sina Prison, killing dozens of guards and freeing hundreds of prisoners. Battles raged around the prison for over a week until they were eventually quelled with the help of the U.S. military.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe have intelligence that ISIS is planning to attack the prisons again, because the prisoners are considered to be a primary force for them,\u201d Abdi said. \u201cIf they find a way out, ISIS will be able to reorganize and reconstitute.\u201d",
      "Those concerns were repeatedly echoed by the U.S. military, which said in a statement last month that the prison population was \u201ca literal and figurative \u2018ISIS Army\u2019 in detention.\u201d",
      "'One of the most dangerous camps in the world'",
      "On a barren stretch of desert roadway, just 26 miles east of Hasakah, is the sprawling Al Hol Camp \u2014 home to around 40,000 people, 93% of whom are women and children, according to the most recent figures from the United Nations, published last February.",
      "Many of them are the families of ISIS fighters and SDF officials said the camp was considered a breeding ground for the next generation of militants.",
      "\u201cA mindset of radicalism is instilled in the residents,\u201d said Jihan Hanan, Al Hol\u2019s director. \u201cThey are only becoming more extreme.\u201d",
      "With limited resources, she said staff could guard only the perimeter, meaning violence was rife inside what she called \u201cone of the most dangerous camps in the world.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThere have been murders inside, and some are armed with weapons,\u201d she said, adding that there were regular escape attempts.",
      "Inside the camp, in a section dubbed The Annex, the wives of foreign ISIS fighters and their children are held, around 6,000 people from 51 countries. Many of their governments have shown little or no interest in repatriating them in the six or so years they have languished in the camp.",
      "Considered by the SDF to hold the most extreme residents in the whole camp, The Annex is fenced off from the rest of the facility, with guard posts standing at the exit.",
      "Inside, wild dogs pick through piles of garbage, near trash-strewn muddy pathways and open sewers.",
      "Women gather together, all fully covered in the Islamic niqab, as hundreds of young children from strikingly diverse ethnic backgrounds wander through the squalor. There is little electricity or running water, and their patchwork plastic tents offer meager protection against Syria\u2019s winter chill.",
      "In another part of The Annex kids chant \u201cAllahu Akbar,\u201d Arabic for \u201cGod is great,\u201d while raising a single finger in the air, a trademark of ISIS. After hurling vulgar insults and threatening violence, they start to throw stones."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on all foreign aid could not have come at a worse time for Sudan, which is facing famine amid it's 2-year civil war.",
    "story": [
      "For a country ravaged by two years of brutal civil war and with over 30 million people \u2014 or more than half of the population \u2014 in need of humanitarian assistance, President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on all foreign aid could not have come at a worse time for Sudan.",
      "As battles rage in the North African country, a network of communal kitchens has had to immediately stop most of its operations due to a lack of funding, about 75% of which came from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to their organizers.",
      "Part of Sudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs) \u2014\u00a0a civilian-led, grassroots effort to provide humanitarian support \u2014 the kitchens have been able to provide food, medicine and other basic supplies to people in parts of the country unreachable by aid agencies.",
      "Without the American funding \u201ca lot of people will die because of hunger,\u201d Abuzar Osman Suliman, the coordinator of the ERRs in Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region, told NBC News on Friday.",
      "Suliman, who said it cost $10,000 for a single kitchen in Darfur to feed 250 families for two weeks, gave a 10 to 20 day window for people to start dying.",
      "Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 freezing foreign assistance, forcing American-funded aid and development programs worldwide to shut down and lay off staff.\u00a0Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had sought to mitigate the damage by issuing a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs, but USAID officials and aid groups say neither funding nor staffing have been reinstated in order to allow even the most essential programs to start working again.",
      "In Sudan, Suliman said all 40 of ERRs\u2019 community kitchens had to close in Darfur\u2019s Zamzam camp, where more than 1 million displaced people have sought refuge from the conflict between the country\u2019s two main warring powers \u2014 the Sudanese Armed Forces controlled by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, led by his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.",
      "Once allies, both men were part of the military establishment that seized power following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in 2021. But although they agreed to rule together, their alliance spectacularly broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, war broke out in April 2023.",
      "Because of intense fighting and an ongoing RSF siege in the surrounding area, U.N. agencies have been unable to get substantial amounts of food relief to the Zamzam camp and a famine was declared in the camps in August, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an international system that sets a scale used by the United Nations and governments.\u00a0So people are now facing the choice between staying in the camp to die from hunger, or risk their lives by moving through Darfur areas besieged by the RSF, Suliman said.",
      "Famine has since spread to four other areas of Sudan, according to the IPC, and is expected to deepen and spread in coming months due to the war and impeded access to humanitarian assistance.",
      "In Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum, intense block-by-block fighting has made aid delivery almost impossible.\u00a0The World Food Program said it was only able to deliver its first shipment in December, 20 months after the conflict erupted, and even then, it said it had to rely on the ERRs for distribution.",
      "Across Khartoum, the ERRs were operating 742 kitchens and serving around 816,000 people before Trump's executive order, but now 80% of those kitchens have closed, according to Hajooj Kuka, an external communications officer for the Emergency Response Rooms.",
      "In a country riven by ethnic and political divisions, the ERRs have espoused neutrality and solidarity, allowing them to operate in areas controlled by SAF as well as the RSF, leveraging local know-how to navigate hostile terrain.",
      "The kitchens are organized locally and entirely volunteer-led, Kuka said, adding the whole ERR system was run by housewives, doctors, engineers, electricians \u2014 \u201cjust everybody.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis minute, I\u2019m trying to save the lives of the people in the district and the volunteers,\u201d he said in an interview Friday. \u201cI\u2019m just, like, going crazy trying to get any money.\u201d",
      "Without immediate funding, famine could take hold in the city, he added.",
      "Because USAID was often distributing money through other nongovernmental organizations working in Sudan, Kuka said the ERR organizers weren\u2019t always aware of how crucial USAID was to their funding, until the money was taken away.",
      "On Friday, Kuka said he found out that a $50,000 grant he expected from the Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services (CRS) had been suddenly canceled because of the U.S. freeze.",
      "The humanitarian agency told NBC News they could not comment on the grant cancellation.",
      "CRS, which has about 5,000 employees, told staffers last week to expect layoffs because of the administration\u2019s cuts to their foreign aid grants, according to Reuters. The organization has a $1.5 billion budget, about half of it funded by USAID.",
      "Across Sudan, the cost of operating the kitchens was around $20 million a year, the ERR communications officer said. But the localized ad-hoc nature of the work is also what made them so vulnerable to U.S. funding cuts, Kuka added.",
      "While U.N. agencies may have several months of supplies in the pipeline, the ERRs often relied on purchasing goods directly from local markets. So when the cash flow was cut off, the kitchens could no longer buy and cook food.Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official and country representative in Sudan, said the exemption issued by Rubio was \u201cvery complicated, nobody really knows how it works.\u201d",
      "Tracy, who is currently vice president of Proximity 2 Humanity, a nonprofit working to shore up funding for Sudan\u2019s ERRs, added that some agencies might be big enough to continue operations, relying on a future reimbursement if an exemption is granted, but a lot of smaller organizations can\u2019t do that.",
      "On Friday, a federal judge paused an order putting USAID staff on administrative leave, but Tracy said it is still not clear to what capacity the agency will be able to operate.",
      "\u201cIn theory they have a week where they\u2019re able to work again \u2014access to emails, etc. \u2014 but what they could do before this was heavily curtailed, so unclear as to how much they can do, like make payments.\u201d",
      "Kuka said he is also appealing to any other institutional donors to fill in the funding gaps, using what little they have left to support emergency assistance programs.",
      "\u201cAfter a month, it will be completely done,\u201d he said."

      "LONDON \u2014 Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a congested soccer calendar.",
      "Arteta said he felt a \u201cbig pain in the tummy\u201d after seeing Kai Havertz pick up a serious hamstring injury at the end of a light training session in Dubai that will rule the Germany forward out for the rest of the season.",
      "It further stretches Arsenal\u2019s resources up front, with Gabriel Jesus having ruptured his ACL, winger Bukayo Saka having not played since December because of a hamstring issue and another wide player, Gabriel Martinelli, set to miss the next month also with a hamstring injury.",
      "Two more games per team were added to the first stage of this season\u2019s Champions League, while Arsenal also went deep in the English League Cup \u2014 it was eliminated by Newcastle in the two-legged semifinals \u2014 and is in a title race with Liverpool in the Premier League.",

      "An expanded and revamped Club World Cup, which takes place in the United States at the end of the season and lasts a month, also extends the schedule for many teams, though not Arsenal this year. Some players have openly complained that it is detrimental to their performance and health and the busy match schedule is facing legal challenges and the possibility of strike action.",
      "For Arteta, it\u2019s no surprise to see injury rates soar at Arsenal because of the extra load on players and what he perceives to be an increased intensity in modern-day soccer.",
      "\u201cYou cannot prove it and the evidence we can provide is very limited in many aspects and every case is very different but already some of them (injuries) we know are based on load and minutes. It\u2019s inevitable,\u201d Arteta said Friday. \u201cWe have players who have been injured who have played 130 games over the last two seasons. In the end, it\u2019s an accident waiting to happen if you continue to load and load and load.",
      "\u201cIs this season an accumulation of that? Is it the stress of that? Is it luck? Is it preparation? Is it methodology? There are a lot of factors. It\u2019s very difficult to point at something but the schedule that\u2019s planned is super-demanding and for certain players, especially explosive players, it\u2019s a real issue.\u201d",
      "Havertz appears to have been unlucky in picking up his injury, with Arteta explaining how the German stretched his leg to stop a shot at a set-piece and \u201cfelt his hamstring go.\u201d",
      "Given the number of injuries sustained by Arsenal players this season \u2014 others to have had long spells out include Ben White, Martin Odegaard, Riccardo Calafiori and Takehiro Tomiyasu \u2014 some have questioned whether Arteta\u2019s training methods are to blame.",
      "Maybe that was the reason why Arteta was eager to point out that Arsenal\u2019s players now \u201ctrain less than ever\u201d and go into a deeper explanation about how too many games \u2014 and, as a result, not enough training \u2014 affects players\u2019 recovery.",
      "\u201cThe muscle is undertrained and then you expose the muscle and the tendon to an exposure that they cannot absorb because the tendon needs 72 hours to recover,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cA lot of people talk about what we\u2019re doing outside. It\u2019s not outside, it\u2019s inside.",
      "\u201cWhen you have to load that muscle for two or three or six or eight weeks that you haven\u2019t in training, the risk of injury is much bigger \u2014 one, because the tendon is not recovered, and then it\u2019s not prepared to absorb the load and stress you are going to put it under every three days.\u201d"

      "BANGKOK \u2014 Some 260 people believed to have been trafficked and trapped into working in online scam centers are to be repatriated after they were rescued from Myanmar, Thailand\u2019s army announced Thursday.",
      "In a fresh crackdown on scam centers operating from Southeast Asia, the Thai army said it was coordinating an effort to repatriate some 260 people believed to have been victims of human trafficking after they were rescued and sent from Myanmar to Thailand.",
      "Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, which share borders with Thailand, have become known as havens for criminal syndicates that are estimated to have forced hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia and elsewhere into helping run online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.",
      "Such scams have extracted tens of billions of dollars from victims around the world, according to U.N. experts, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and trapped in virtual slavery.",
      "An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023 after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations in Myanmar\u2019s northern Shan state along its border. Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated.",
      "The army said that those rescued in the most recent operation came from 20 nationalities \u2014 with significant numbers from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan and China. There were also nationals of Indonesia, Nepal, Taiwan, Uganda, Laos, Brazil, Burundi, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Ghana and India. They were sent across the border from Myanmar\u2019s Myawaddy district to Thailand\u2019s Tak province on Wednesday.",
      "Reports in Thai media said a Myanmar ethnic militia that controls the area where they were held, the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, was responsible for freeing the workers and taking them to the border. Myanmar\u2019s military government exercises little control over frontier areas where ethnic minorities predominate.",
      "Several ethnic militias are believed to be involved in criminal activities, including drug trafficking and protecting call-center scam operations.",
      "The Thai army statement said the rescued people will undergo questioning, and if determined to be victims of human trafficking, will enter a process of protection while waiting to be sent back to their countries.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, who is also defense minister, said Wednesday that there might be many more scam workers waiting to be repatriated from Myanmar through Thailand, but that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their country of origin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made it clear that Thailand is not going to set up another shelter,\u201d he told reporters during a visit in Sa Kaeo province, which borders Cambodia. Thailand hosts nine refugee camps along the border holding more than 100,000 people, most from Myanmar\u2019s ethnic Karen minority.",
      "Phumtham added that Thailand would also need to question them before sending them back, both to make sure that they are victims of human trafficking, and also to get information that would help the police investigate the trafficking and scam problems.",
      "On a visit to China in early February, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra vowed along with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to crack down on the scam networks that plague Southeast Asia.",
      "Many dramatic stories of Chinese people being lured to work in Bangkok only to be trafficked into a scam compound in Myanmar have surfaced. Chinese actor Wang Xing was a high-profile case but was quickly rescued after his tale spread on social media.",
      "Underlining Beijing\u2019s concern, Liu Zhongyi, China\u2019s vice minister of public security and commissioner of its Criminal Investigation Bureau, made an official visit to Thailand last month and inspected the border area opposite where many of the Myanmar scam centers are located.",
      "Just ahead of Paetongtarn\u2019s visit to China, the Thai government issued an order to cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar along the border with northern Thailand, citing national security and severe damage that the country has suffered from scam operations.",
      "Her government is considering expanding this measure to Thailand\u2019s northeastern areas bordering Cambodia, said Thai Defense Ministry spokesperson Thanathip Sawangsang, who explained that officials had already removed internet cables that were installed in the areas illegally."

      "His lawyer Anil Prasad told the court that prosecutors had failed to provide sufficient evidence to convict Dawson, the Fijian Broadcasting Corp. reported.",

      "He could also apply for his life sentence to be reduced to a fixed term, which would set a release date, Naylor said.",
      "Dawson worked in the information technology department at Youth Villages, a nonprofit child welfare and support organization based in Memphis. An online records search showed no criminal arrests for Dawson in Shelby County, which includes Memphis.",
      "The Turtle Island resort, where the pair stayed, is an exclusive and remote island that accommodates only 14 couples at a time. Yasawa is a group of about 20 volcanic islands in the west of Fiji, a nation of 930,000 people."

    "story": [
      "The fossil of a Jurassic bird unearthed in southeastern China has major implications for the history of avian evolution, researchers say.",
      "The newly discovered Baminornis zhenghensis, a quail-sized bird, roamed the skies some 150 million years ago during the Jurassic period, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature, meaning it is among the oldest birds known to mankind, along with the iconic Archaeopteryx that was discovered in Germany in 1862 and is of similar age.",
      "\u201cFor more than 150 years now, Archaeopteryx has stood alone,\u201d said Steve Brusatte, a University of Edinburgh paleontologist who wrote a commentary accompanying the study.",
      "\u201cDuring all of that time, it has remained as the only unquestionable bird fossil from the Jurassic Period,\u201d he told NBC News in an email.",
      "While there have been other birdlike Jurassic fossils found here and there, Brusatte said, there was a \u201chuge mystery and a frustrating gap\u201d in the fossil record: If Archaeopteryx was flying by then, other birds must have been too. So where were their fossils?",
      "The 2023 discovery of Baminornis in Zhenghe county in China\u2019s Fujian province, now among the most important discoveries since Archaeopteryx, helps fill that gap, he said, making it the \u201csecond unquestioned bird from the Jurassic Period.\u201d",
      "Min Wang, the lead author of the study, said it was a \"very exciting\" discovery.",
      "\u201cThese two fossil birds have systematically changed our understanding about the earliest evolution of birds,\" the paleontologist from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences told NBC News in an email.",
      "\"They demonstrate that the origin of birds is much earlier than current thought.\"",
      "Unlike the half-bird, half-reptile Archaeopteryx, which had a long and skinny tail similar to that of a velociraptor, Baminornis had a short tail with some of its vertebrae fused into a short, stubby nubbin called a\u00a0pygostyle \u2014 a crucial aerodynamic feature that pushes the body\u2019s center of mass toward the wings, similar to those in modern-day birds that help them fly better.",
      "Until the discovery of Baminornis, short tails had been found only in birds known to have lived around 20 million years later,\u00a0such as Eoconfuciusornis and Protopteryx.",
      "\u201cWhat excites me most is that it is a more advanced bird than Archaeopteryx, and it could fly much better,\u201d Brusatte said.",
      "Baminornis was much more anatomically complex than Archaeopteryx, which Brusatte said was a \u201cprimitive\u201d bird with claws and sharp teeth like its dinosaur ancestors.",
      "Archaeopteryx, which played a crucial role in determining that today\u2019s birds evolved from dinosaurs, was a \u201ctextbook example of a creature caught in the act of evolution like a freeze frame,\u201d he added.",
      "The vast difference between the two similarly aged birds, discovered about 5,500 miles apart, has led the team behind the Nature study to believe that avian evolution occurred millions of years earlier than previously thought, with the estimate now at about 164 to 172 million years ago.",
      "In addition to dozens of fossils of aquatic or semiaquatic animals, the Zhenghe Fauna collection, as it\u2019s referred to, includes at least three fossils so far that belong to the group including birds and their closest relatives. The researchers said this suggests the collection holds great potential to \u201cenrich our understanding of early bird diversification\u201d and \u201cfill a critical gap in the evolutionary history of terrestrial ecosystem\u201d toward the end of the Jurassic period.",
      "Though the Baminornis fossil preserved much of the skeleton, the feathers were not preserved, leaving unanswered questions about the size and structure of its wings. It was also missing the skull, limiting clues about the bird\u2019s diet.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cBaminornis tells us that a variety of birds lived during the Jurassic, and they flew in different ways,\u201d Brusatte said."

      "PUNTA ARENAS, Chile \u2014 A\u00a0humpback whale\u00a0briefly swallowed a kayaker off Chilean Patagonia before quickly releasing him unharmed. The incident, caught on camera, quickly went viral.",
      "Last Saturday, Adri\u00e1n Simancas was kayaking with his father, Dell, in Bah\u00eda El \u00c1guila near the San Isidro Lighthouse in the Strait of Magellan when a humpback whale surfaced, engulfing Adri\u00e1n and his yellow kayak for a few seconds before letting him go.",
      "Dell, just yards away, captured the moment on video while encouraging his son to stay calm.",
      "\u201cStay calm, stay calm,\u201d he can be heard saying after his son was released from the whale\u2019s mouth.",
      "\u201cI thought I was dead,\u201d Adri\u00e1n told The Associated Press. \u201cI thought it had eaten me, that it had swallowed me.\u201d",
      "He described the \u201cterror\u201d of those few seconds and explained that his real fear set in only after resurfacing, fearing that the huge animal would hurt his father or that he would perish in the frigid waters.",
      "Despite the terrifying experience, Dell remained focused, filming and reassuring his son while grappling with his own worry.",
      "\u201cWhen I came up and started floating, I was scared that something might happen to my father too, that we wouldn\u2019t reach the shore in time, or that I would get hypothermia,\u201d Adri\u00e1n said.",
      "After a few seconds in the water, Adri\u00e1n managed to reach his father\u2019s kayak and was quickly assisted. Despite the scare, both returned to shore uninjured.",
      "Located about 1,600 miles south of Santiago, Chile\u2019s capital, the Strait of Magellan is a major tourist attraction in the Chilean Patagonia, known for adventure activities.",
      "Its frigid waters pose a challenge for sailors, swimmers and explorers who attempt to cross it in different ways.",
      "Although it\u2019s summer in the Southern Hemisphere, temperatures in the region remain cool, with minimums dropping to 39 degrees Fahrenheit and highs rarely exceeding 68 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "While whale attacks on humans are extremely rare in Chilean waters, whale deaths from collisions with cargo ships have increased in recent years, and\u00a0strandings have become a recurring issue\u00a0in the last decade."

      "The first flight from the U.S., carrying people from Afghanistan, China, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, arrived on Wednesday, and two more will land\u00a0soon, Mulino said at a news conference.
