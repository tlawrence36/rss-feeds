      "LONDON -- Terence Stamp, the British actor who often played the role of a complex villain, including that of General Zod in the early Superman films, has died. He was 87.",
      "His death on Sunday was disclosed in a death notice published online.",
      "The London-born Stamp started his film career with 1962\u2019s seafaring \u201cBilly Budd,\u201d for which he earned an Oscar nomination.",
      "Stamp\u2019s six decades in the business were peppered with highlights, including his touching portrayal of the transsexual Bernadette in 1994's \u201cThe Adventure of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\" Stamp also was widely praised for his lead in director Steven Soderbergh\u2019s 1999 crime drama \u201cThe Limey.\u201d",
      "But it will be his portrayal of the bearded Zod in 1978's \u201cSuperman\u201d and its sequel \u201cSuperman II\u201d two years later that most people associate with Stamp. As the Kryptonian arch enemy to Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel, Stamp introduced a darker and charming \u2014 more human \u2014 element to the franchise, one that's been replicated in countless superhero movies ever since.",
      "Stamp started out his film career in the early 1960s as part of the \u201cangry young men\u201d movement that was introducing an element of social realism into British moviemaking.",
      "That was perhaps most notable in the 1965 adaptation of John Fowles\u2019 creepy debut novel \u201cThe Collector,\u201d where he played the awkward and lonely Freddie Clegg, who kidnapped Samantha Eggar\u2019s Miranda Grey in a warped attempt to win her love. It was a performance that would earn the young Stamp, fresh off his Oscar nomination, the best actor award at 1965\u2019s Cannes Film Festival.",

      "Born in London\u2019s East End on July 22, 1938, Stamp lived a colorful life, particularly during the 1960s when he had a string of romances, including with actress Julie Christie and model Jean Shrimpton. He married 29-year-old Elizabeth O\u2019Rourke in 2002 at the age of 64 but the couple divorced six years later. Stamp did not have any children.",
      "Stamp retained his looks as the years ticked by, his natural handsomeness hardened by a more grizzled look.",
      "He generally sought to keep his standards high, but up to a point.",

      "\u201cI felt then that it wasn\u2019t goodbye forever. I felt we\u2019d be back one day,\u201d says producer Judy Craymer, who had conceived of the show in the 1980s. \u201cI always hoped.\u201d",
      "That one day has become today as the ABBA-fueled, feel-good musical returns to its first home on Broadway, the Winter Garden Theatre. It reopens Thursday night.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like when you go to visit the old place where you went to high school,\u201d says Victor Wallace, who made his Broadway debut in the show in 2012, stayed to the final curtain in 2015 and has returned. \u201cThere's so many backstage stories and people and I\u2019m a little overwhelmed.\u201d",
      "Fans have fueled the return of \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d to make it among the top earners on Broadway, last week grossing $1.57 million over seven previews, fourth behind only \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cThe Lion King\u201d and \u201cHamilton.\u201d",
      "\u201cMamma Mia!\u201d endured plenty during its first Broadway life \u2014 wars, hurricanes, the 2008 financial meltdown, the move to a smaller theater and critics, who never warmed to the show\u2019s high-energy sweetness.",
      "A hit in London \u2014 where it is still playing \u2014 \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d opened in New York just a few weeks after the 2001 terror attacks when there was deep gloom and anxiety.",

      "Craymer sees the data about the new flock of theatergoers and notes this \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d is popular with groups. \u201cThere were people that had seen it on Broadway \u2014 probably when they were younger \u2014 and now coming back in their 20s and 30s and then bringing their daughters or family.\u201d",

A sequel, \u201cMamma Mia! Here We Go Again,\u201d came out a decade later. ABBA\u2019s music continues to be the backdrop for numerous popular TikTok trends.",

      "After getting out of the scripted TV business in 2021 for reality TV and sports coverage, USA Network is returning to air scripted originals with the legal drama \u201cThe Rainmaker.\"",
      "Since 2021, the USA Network had stacked its lineup with reality shows and sports, entirely forgoing original, scripted programming. Fans of \"Suits\u201d, \u201cWhite Collar\u201d and \u201cMonk\u201d were left with only memories of those shows' case-of-the-week storytelling. But on Friday, the network returns to scripted TV with the legal thriller \u201cThe Rainmaker.\u201d",
      "If the title sounds familiar, it's because it\u2019s based on the 1995 novel by John Grisham, which was first adapted into the 1997 Matt Damon-starring film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. In this \u201cRainmaker,\u201d British actor Milo Callaghan plays Rudy Baylor. It's the first leading role for Callaghan, who had previously played recurring characters in shows like HBO's \u201cDune: Prophecy\" and Starz\u2019s \u201cThe Spanish Princess.\u201d",
      "Baylor is fresh out of law school and about to start working at the largest law firm in the state, run by Leo F. Drummond (John Slattery). On his first day, Baylor gets fired after challenging Drummond in a meeting. Desperate for work, he takes a job at a small ambulance-chasing firm that works out of a former taco joint. His boss is Jocelyn \u201cBruiser\u201d Stone (Lana Parrilla, in a gender swap from the film where Mickey Rourke had the role). She\u2019s smart, confident and not afraid to use her sex appeal to get what she wants. Rudy\u2019s first big case pits him against the big, fancy law firm that let him go \u2014 and his girlfriend who still works there.",
      "Callaghan told The Associated Press about learning legalese while doing a Memphis accent and familiarizing himself with the source material. Answers are edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "CALLAGHAN: I watched it when I got cast. Matt Damon is somebody that every young actor would look up to. I wanted to be aware of the work that he did. I mean, it was a Coppola movie as well, so I was excited to see it. And then I gave it maybe like 20 minutes' thought and focused on the script because it is different and I think we have 10 hours of television to explore this character. We go on a windier road than the movie.",
      "CALLAGHAN: Yes. It\u2019s a slow-paced thriller, really, but fantastic. And there\u2019s this chunk, it must be about 100 pages, of him just preparing for this case for months and months and months. So I never wanted it to feel like it was off-the-hand genius. It felt like this is a situation that has to be honored to a certain extent. Like, you can be a fantastic lawyer, but you don\u2019t get there without grinding and grafting. We had great scenes where we were working late into the night.",

      "CALLAGHAN: Consistent work with a great dialogue coach. I remember I got there on my first day and I was running lines with P.J. Byrne, who plays Deck, and he\u2019s kind of looking at me funny. He\u2019s like, \u201cWhy are you talking like that?\u201d I was like, \"What do you mean? Because we start filming in three days.\" I was pronouncing everything phonetically because that was the way I learned. I had to really work on paring it back into a place that felt so natural. For a movie, you might get away with it, but for 10 hours of television, it just has to be light, it has to be quick, it has to be at your fingertips.",
      "CALLAGHAN: \u201cNorth City Hospital.\u201d It was the hardest thing. I was like, 'Why did you call it this?\" I got all this legalese down and then \u201cNorth City Hospital\u201d would shoot me in the foot every time.",
      "CALLAGHAN: I went through major trials, like the whole O.J. Simpson murder trial and the Gwyneth Paltrow trial. And also obscure trials. I studied attorneys and their patterns of speech and the way they address the court. We don't really have the same kind of pop star element to the legal system of like, \u201cThat\u2019s the guy who represented this person and that person.\u201d Studying that is fascinating.",

      "Tristan Rogers, who played legacy character Robert Scorpio on ABC's \u201cGeneral Hospital,\u201d died Friday, less than one month after he made a special appearance on the soap opera. He was 79.",
      "\u201cThe entire \u2018General Hospital\u2019 family is heartbroken to hear of Tristan Rogers' passing,\u201d said Frank Valentini, the show's executive producer, in a statement. \u201cTristan has captivated our fans for 45 years and Port Charles will not be the same without him (or Robert Scorpio).\u201d",
      "Born in Melbourne, Australia, Rogers' first foray into performing was in his early twenties and playing drums in a rock band with a group of friends. They weren't successful so Rogers turned to commercial work and modeling to earn some money. When the band dissolved, Rogers decided to give acting a try. After various roles in Australia, he also worked as a DJ and eventually moved to Los Angeles to try to break into Hollywood. He said casting directors were initially turned off by his accent but he eventually landed a two-day role on \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d in 1980.",
      "\u201cI had no idea at the point how big the show was,\u201d Rogers told fellow \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d actor Maurice Benard on the YouTube show, \u201cState of Mind with Maurice Benard\u201d in 2022.",
      "\u201cI had no name. I was brought in expressly to beat up the hero, Luke, (played by Anthony Geary), and then disappear,\u201d Rogers said. His first day was half-over when then-executive producer Gloria Monty asked if he would like to stay on. They had no character written for him so for three weeks Monty asked him to just appear in scenes \u201clooking furtive, looking suspicious\u201d until they came up with a storyline. It was decided he would play a spy known as \u201cCK8\u201d and eventually he was given the name Robert Scorpio. The character would remain a fixture in Port Charles for the rest of Rogers' life, even when he wasn't a current cast member.",
      "Scorpio's on again/off again romance with Emma Samms' character, Holly Sutton, remained a favorite among fans. Scorpio also had a romance, and many storylines with another spy, Anna Devane, played by Finola Hughes. Scorpio and Devane shared a daughter, Robin, played by Kimberly McCullough. Samms returned to the show for a stint last fall where it was revealed that Scorpio was the father of her adult daughter, Sasha Gilmore (played by Sofia Mattson.)",

      "Filmmaker Kate Beecroft points her lens toward the real cowgirls of the Badlands in the lyrical new film \u201cEast of Wall.\u201d",
      "The film blends fact and fiction to tell a story about the working women of South Dakota, skilled riders and trainers with ranching and rodeo in their blood who also can't seem to catch a break. There are a few Hollywood actors in the mix, including Jennifer Ehle as a hard living grandmother with a lifetime of regrets as well as some nuggets of wisdom and Scoot McNairy as an out-of-towner who wants to acquire the land, but most of the cast are non-actors playing themselves. The film won an audience award earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival.",
      "At the heart of \u201cEast of Wall,\u201d now playing in select theaters, is Tabatha Zimiga, a South Dakota native whose ability to tame wild horses is the stuff of legend in the area. In the film, the horses she rescues and rehabilitates are sold at auctions and often accepted for far less than what they\u2019re worth. She needs the money. There are bills to pay on the ranch and many mouths to feed (not just her own kids, but others from around the town who come to her for safety and shelter when their own caretakers stop providing).",
      "Tabatha is also living with new and old traumas, from the generational agony of abuse to the more recent death of her husband, the shocking circumstances of which are withheld for some time. But the effects of the loss are still felt, especially for their daughter Porshia (played by her real-life daughter Porshia Zimiga), whose grief is threatening to turn into hate of her mother. Teenage Porshia provides the poetic voiceovers, in which she talks about riding, her mother and, most effectively, the land. It's reminiscent of Linda Manz\u2019s narration in \u201cDays of Heaven.\u201d",
      "\u201cEast of Wall\u201d is best when it\u2019s capturing the landscapes and the girls in action, riding and filming energetic TikToks of their friends racing cars on horseback. Some have suggested that \u201cEast of Wall\u201d might have been stronger as a documentary. These women are vibrant and authentic and don't look like anyone we see in the movies these days, with real bodies and imperfect skin, heads half-shaved, tattoos everywhere and the ability to really, really ride \u2014 no stunt team required. And they have stories to tell, many of them unhappy, as we see in one of the most moving non-action scenes involving a group of mothers speaking candidly about their lives and their regrets.",
      "The real-life drama of financial instability is compelling and likely rooted in truth; however, the introduction of McNairy\u2019s suspect Texan feels like a narrative contrivance and drama for drama\u2019s sake. He offers to buy the ranch and let them live and work as usual, just for him now instead of themselves. These are the kind of scenes that remind you that the filmmakers, despite all their best intentions and care, are, in essence, also interlopers in this world.",

      "The film is Cregger\u2019s follow-up to his solo directorial debut with the 2022 genre-bending horror, \u201cBarbarian.\u201d That critically-acclaimed film had a slower start and smaller budget, but still topped the charts during its premiere with $10 million domestically and made a splash in the genre.",

      "Billy Joel's beloved motorcycle shop on Long Island, New York, is closing down after nearly 15 years of offering fans a free peek at his personal collection of dozens of bikes.",
      "The music icon will be shuttering 20th Century Cycles in Oyster Bay in late September and auctioning off his collection later this year because of a brain disorder he has been diagnosed with, according to a spokesperson, Claire Mercuri.",
      "In May, Joel announced that he was canceling upcoming concerts after learning he has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, a fluid buildup in his brain that can affect thinking, concentrating, memory, movement and more, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The 76-year-old singer, composer and pianist was having trouble with his balance but otherwise felt good, he said in an interview last month on Bill Maher's Club Random podcast.",
      "Joel, who grew up in nearby Hicksville, opened 20th Century Cycles in late 2010 as a place to maintain and repair his motorcycles, restore and customize ones he bought and showcase his collection for the public at no charge.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically promoting an aesthetic here,\" he said in a 2013 YouTube video filmed at the shop. \"I like older style. I like the automotive style from the \u201830s to the \u201960s. I wanted to collect a whole bunch of those kinds of bikes, put \u2019em in one place and let people see what that era of bike looked like. Because it\u2019s starting to be a lost aesthetic.\u201d",
      "He said he also wanted to bring foot traffic and business to downtown Oyster Bay \u2014 a ritzy waterfront community about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of midtown Manhattan \u2014 where part of the street that includes 20th Century Cycles was renamed Billy Joel Way in 2023.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been living in this community for a long time,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cI actually grew up not far from here. And I\u2019d like to get a little interest going into the town and the village.\u201d",

      "Joel's nearby home in Centre Island is listed for $29.9 million, and he has been living in South Florida, while keeping a home in Sag Harbor on Long Island.",
      "The shop became a popular stop for motorcycle enthusiasts and tourists. It was home to Joel's collection of more than 75 bikes, dating back all the way to the 1940s and including Harley-Davidsons, Triumphs, Ducatis, Moto Guzzis, Indians and BMWs. One of the most valuable, he said, was a 1952 Vincent Rapide, which can sell for tens of thousands of dollars and sometimes more, according to auction sites.",
      "\u201cI think everybody in Oyster Bay would agree that it\u2019s a big loss,\" said Ted Bahr, who owns a vintage rock poster gallery next to 20th Century Cycles. \u201cBilly\u2019s place is visited on weekends by dozens and dozens of people, typically on motorcycles but also people in cars,. People come up and look at the window all the time. I mean it\u2019s a real destination. Billy Joel is a real superstar, and he is a hometown boy, so it\u2019s really unfortunate.\"",
      "The motorcycles that were in the shop have already been moved out. But it has been open on recent weekends selling new, used and vintage motorcycle parts that were still in stock there.",
      "Joel's enthusiasm for motorcycles dates back decades. In 1982, he was riding a motorcycle on Long Island when he was struck by a car that ran a red light, injuring his left thumb and dislocating his right wrist. He spent about a month in the hospital. He has also ridden motorcycles in various benefits for 9/11 first responders, breast cancer and other causes over the years.",
      "A date for the auction of his collection has not been set.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein faces sentencing and a possible retrial in his New York City sex crimes case, but when they\u2019ll happen \u2014 and whether he\u2019ll be back in front of another jury \u2014 is still up in the air.",
      "Manhattan Judge Curtis Farber said Wednesday he could sentence Weinstein on Sept. 30 \u2014 but only if there\u2019s no retrial on a rape charge that the last jury failed to reach a verdict on.",
      "Weinstein, 73, was convicted in June of forcing oral sex on TV and movie production assistant and producer Miriam Haley in 2006. The charge carries a possible sentence of up to 25 years in prison.",
      "At the same time, the jury acquitted him of forcing oral sex on another woman, one-time model Kaja Sokola, but couldn\u2019t decide a charge that he raped hairstylist and actor Jessica Mann in 2013.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors told Farber that they\u2019re ready to take Weinstein to trial for a third time on the rape charge, which is punishable by up to four years in prison. That\u2019s less time than Weinstein has already served.",
      "Mann is on board to testify again, they said.",
      "Prosecutors requested a January trial date, citing witness availability and their own caseload. Farber balked at that, saying a January date is too far away and conflicts with another, unrelated trial he\u2019s already scheduled. He proposed having the trial in the fall.",
      "\u201cThe case needs to be tried this year,\u201d Farber said.",
      "Weinstein lawyer Arthur Aidala agreed, telling Farber he\u2019d prefer a trial at \u201cthe earliest the court can accommodate us.\u201d",
      "Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg said she would ask Mann and other witnesses about their availability for a trial in the fall.",
      "If a fall trial happens, it would likely put Weinstein\u2019s high-profile #MeToo case back in court as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is in the final throes of his reelection bid.",

      "Aidala told reporters outside court that, in his view, it\u2019s on prosecutors to resolve the rape charge \u2014 either by dropping it and clearing the way for sentencing, or promptly taking it to trial again.",
      "Weinstein sat in court in a wheelchair while wearing a blue suit and black-rimmed glasses. The \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d producer is committed to fighting the rape charge at another trial, Aidala said, though the lawyer didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of reaching a deal with prosecutors to end the case.",
      "For now, the trial date remains unresolved, leaving Weinstein\u2019s possible Sept. 30 sentencing in limbo.",
      "At Weinstein\u2019s first trial in 2020, jurors convicted him of raping Mann and forcing oral sex on production assistant and producer Miriam Haley.",
      "Then an appeals court overturned those convictions and sent the case back for retrial because of legal issues involving other women\u2019s testimony.",
      "This spring, a new jury convicted him again of sexually assaulting Haley and acquitted him of doing the same to another woman who wasn\u2019t part of the first trial. But amid fractious deliberations, the majority-female jury got stuck on the charge related to Mann.",
      "Mann has testified that she also had a consensual, on-and-off relationship with the then-married Weinstein, but that she told him \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this\u201d as he cornered her in the hotel room. She said he persevered with advances and demands until she \u201cjust gave up.\u201d",

      "Part of the rollout for Tuesday's announcement of \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d involved the popular, typically football-focused podcast hosted by Travis Kelce \u2014 Swift\u2019s boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs tight end \u2014 and his brother, Jason Kelce, the former Philadelphia Eagles center. Her episode, which ran just over two hours on audio streaming and an hour and 45 minutes via YouTube, was particularly revealing.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about Swift's episode.",
      "1. Swift partially announced her new album \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d on the podcast, originally shared Tuesday in a preview clip. Swift told the Kelce brothers she wanted to show them something, revealing a mint-green briefcase that featured her initials in orange. Jason Kelce asked what\u2019s in it, prompting her to pull out a vinyl record. \u201cThis is my brand new album, \u2018The Life of a Showgirl,\u2019\u201d she said.2. In the full episode, Swift revealed she worked on the album in Europe while she was on the \u201cEras Tour\" \u2014 flying between dates to record, truly embodying the album's title, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d Then she read the track list. The entire album was completed in Sweden with producers Max Martin and Shellback.3. Why orange? The color embodies \u201cwhat was going on in my inner life during this tour,\u201d she said, before referring to Martin as her \u201cmentor.\u201d \u201cThese guys, they're just geniuses,\u201d she said of Martin and Shellback.4. \u201cBangers,\u201d is how she describes the album. She also said, \u201cThere aren't other ones coming,\u201d referring to a surprising double album like in the case of 2024's \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department.\u201d The release is 12 tracks \u2014 that's it. And it arrives Oct. 3. \u201cI care about this record more than I can even overstate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's a lot more upbeat,\u201d Travis Kelce said, describing it as a \u201c180 from \u2018Tortured Poets.\u2019\u201d Swift agreed, adding, \"Life is more upbeat.\u201d5. The album's theme? \u201cEverything that was going on behind the curtain,\" she said.6. The album's goal? Infectious melodies and vivid lyrics, she explained.7. The album's cover? Themed after \u201cthe end of my day,\u201d she said. \u201cMy day ends with me in a bathtub.\"8. She also shared personal information on \u201cNew Heights,\" arguably in a way she hasn't in years. For example: Her mom \u201cgot a new knee,\u201d she said. And her dad had quintuple bypass surgery this summer. He had \u201cfive blockages in his heart\u201d discovered through a stress test. \u201cThis was the summer of my parental upgrades,\u201d she said.9. She spent considerable time in Florida with Travis Kelce. She also said \u201cour jobs are very similar,\u201d it is \u201cto entertain people for three hours in NFL stadiums.\u201d10. Jason Kelce asked his brother and Swift how they handle online chatter about their relationship. \u201cWe don\u2019t, really. I don\u2019t see a lot of things,\u201d she said. \u201cMy name can be in the actual headline, and it\u2019s none of my business.\u201d11. She shared her favorite segments from \u201cNew Heights,\u201d her self-described \u201cfavorite podcast.\u201d That is \u201cnew news.\u201d She credited the podcast as getting her \u201ca boyfriend,\" and discussed how the pair started dating via friendship bracelet exchange. \u201cIf this guy isn't crazy,\" she joked, he's the kind of guy she's \u201cbeen writing songs about.\u201d12. Swift also discussed the \u201cEras Tour,\u201d which Travis Kelce described as a catalyst for his interest in Swift. She mentioned exiting through an orange door at the last date of the tour, a \u201csubliminal hint that I may be leaving the \u2018Eras Tour\u2019 era,\u201d she said. It was an Easter egg for \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d13. Swift is known for teasing her fans with Easter eggs. Her favorite use? Getting an honorary degree from NYU in 2022 and littering her speech with references to her then yet-to-be-announced \u201cMidnights\u201d album. \u201cFans were like, \u2018the whole speech was an easter egg!\u2019\u201d she said.14. Swift listed her hobbies, which still include baking. Her current obsession? Making sourdough bread, specifically blueberry lemon, cinnamon swirl and Funfetti variations. She offered a few bread-related puns referencing her discography: \u201cAre you bread-y for it?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a loaf story, baby just say yeast,\u201d and \u201cLoafing him was bread,\u201d among them.15. Swift discussed regaining control over her entire body of work. In May, it was announced that the popstar purchased her catalog of recordings \u2014 originally released through Big Machine Records \u2014 from their most recent owner, the private equity firm Shamrock Capital. She did not disclose the amount.16. Swift said she loves all the rerecorded albums, but \u201cRed (Taylor's Version)\u201d is particularly special \u2014 for the fan-favorite \u201cAll Too Well\u201d vault track, which spans ten minutes.",

      "Republican lawmakers are blaming Canada for not preventing and containing wildfires, whose smoke has fouled the air in several states this year",
      "The sternly worded statements and letters are filled with indignation and outrage: Republican U.S. lawmakers say Canada has done too little to contain wildfires and smoke that have fouled the air in several states this summer.",
      "\u201cInstead of enjoying family vacations at Michigan\u2019s beautiful lakes and campgrounds, for the third summer in a row, Michiganders are forced to breathe hazardous air as a result of Canada\u2019s failure to prevent and control wildfires,\u201d read a statement last week from the state\u2019s GOP congressional delegation, echoing similar missives from Republicans in Iowa, New York, North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin.",
      "They\u2019ve demanded more forest thinning, prescribed burns and other measures to prevent fires from starting. They've warned the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.",
      "But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change \u2014 a glaring and shortsighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.",
      "\u201cIf anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\u201d said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international cooperation is needed.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cBut I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change ... we need to globally tackle this problem.\u201d",
      "The country has \u201cbeen fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\u201d when Canada saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs. This year\u2019s first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 28,000 square miles (72,520 square kilometers) burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the U.S. this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.",
      "McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data show that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up and water that once lapped at people\u2019s back doors in Canada\u2019s lake communities now is often hundreds of feet away.",

      "He\u2019s proposed to revoke the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare \u2014 the central basis for U.S. climate change action. He's declared a national energy emergency to expedite fossil fuel development, canceled grants for renewable energy projects and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels.",

      "McMullen, the Canadian wildfire expert, said battling the fires isn\u2019t as simple as many seem to believe.",
      "The country and its territories are vast and fires are often in remote areas where the best \u2014 and sometimes only \u2014 course of action if there are no residents or structures is to let them burn or \u201cit is going to just create another situation for us to deal with in a year or two or 10 or 20 years from now,\u201d McMullen said.",

      "President Donald Trump's policy and tax bill, known as the \u201c big beautiful bill,\u201d blocked Medicaid money from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider. The parameters in the bill also stopped funding from reaching Maine Family Planning, a much smaller provider that provides health care services in one of the poorest and most rural states in the Northeast.",
      "Maine Family Planning filed a federal lawsuit last month seeking to restore reimbursements.",
      "Lawyers and representatives for Maine Family Planning say its 18 clinics provide vital services across the state including cervical cancer screenings, contraception and primary care to low-income residents.

      "It also said many Maine Family Planning clinics \u201cprovide care in very rural areas of the state where there are no other health care providers, and around 70% of their patients rely exclusively on MFP and will not see any other health care provider in a given year.\u201d",

      "Global talks to slash plastic production and the toxic chemicals used to produce plastic products fell apart in Geneva this week",
      "Talks aimed at a global treaty to cut plastic pollution fizzled in Geneva this week, with no agreement to meaningfully reduce the harms to human health and the environment that come with the millions of tons of plastic water bottles, food containers and packaging produced today.",
      "Though as many as 100 countries sought caps on production, powerful oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and the United States stood against them. They argued the caps were unnecessary and a threat to their economies and industries.",
      "That means any progress continues to depend on efforts to improve recycling, reuse and product design \u2014 the very things that powerful nations argued were sufficient to address the problem without resorting to production cuts.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about how successful those efforts have been.",
      "The world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic each year, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that could increase by about 70% by 2040 without meaningful change. A great deal of that ends up in landfills or, worse, the environment.",
      "Pollution isn't the only problem. Plastics, made almost entirely from fossil fuels, are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Plastics generated 3.4% \u2014 or 1.8 billion tons \u2014 of planet-warming emissions across the globe in 2019, the United Nations says.",
      "Not very.",
      "It's notoriously difficult to recycle plastics; only 6% of what's made gets recycled, according to the OECD. That's largely because different kinds of plastic cannot be recycled together. They have different chemical compositions, making it costly and time-consuming, and requiring a lot of manual sorting.",
      "\u201cThere are many different colors of plastics, many different types of plastics called polymers, and 16,000 to 17,000 different chemicals used to make plastics, so by design, plastics are not easily recyclable,\" said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, an organization that works to cut plastic pollution.",
      "Experts say plastic is different from materials like paper, cardboard, metal and glass, which all get reused at much higher rates. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates glass recycling at about 31%, and things like steel cans at about 71%. As much as 64% of paper and 74% of cardboard get recycled, according to the American Forest & Paper Association.",
      "But \u201cIf you just think of your own home or apartment, you might have a bright orange hard plastic detergent container on top of your washing machine, and then you might have a plastic bag,\u201d Enck said. \u201cThose two things cannot get recycled together.\"",
      "The plastics industry says innovations in material science are helping to incorporate more recycled plastics into products and enable more plastic products to be recyclable. Ross Eisenberg, president of America\u2019s Plastic Makers, noted the need for an \u201call-of-the-above approach.\u201d",
      "He said this also includes upgrading recycling infrastructure or improving sorting to capture more used plastics. This also means making recycling more accessible and helping consumers know what can and can\u2019t go in the recycling bin.",
      "But there are a lot of limitations to this.",
      "Depending on consumers for accurate pre-sorting is a lot to ask. And cities may hesitate to make costly infrastructure improvements to their recycling programs if there is little financial incentive or market for the recycled material.",
      "\"Local recycling facilities, or markets for the recycled material, don\u2019t always exist. Where the collection and processing infrastructure does exist, the recycling plants are essentially plastic production facilities, with the same air, water, and soil pollution problems that are harmful to local residents,\" said Holly Kaufman, director of The Plastics & Climate Project and senior fellow at World Resources Institute.",

      "California is currently suing oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, alleging deception about the possibilities of plastic recycling.",
      "Because of this, Kaufman says, \u201cThe aim should be to significantly reduce plastic production, use, and waste, not recycle more.\u201d",
      "\u201cReuse means creating packaging or products designed to be used multiple times, like refillable containers, or more durable zippered bags that can be washed and refilled many times, extending their lifespan and reducing waste,\u201d Eisenberg, of America's Plastic Makers, said.",
      "Experts say reuse is extremely important, but reusable products shouldn\u2019t necessarily be used for consumables because of the risk of microplastics.",
      "Redesigning plastic often means making it easier to recycle. That can be using one material in packaging instead of several, or printing labels directly onto a container rather than using a separate one that is glued on, but that is more complex.",
      "Alternatives to plastics could also be made out of sustainable, less harmful and even regenerative materials, such as seaweed, Kaufman said. There has been progress on this front, but most solutions have not scaled up yet.",

    "story": [
      "Reusable menstrual products, including cups, discs and period underwear, have gained traction as a cost-effective, long-lasting, environmental alternative to single-use products",
      "It was six months ago that Selin Celikoyar bought her last tampon and switched to a reusable menstrual disc.",
      "\"I had already been wary of tampons from an environmental perspective and also from a biological perspective. I felt that they were very wasteful and expensive to consistently keep buying,\" she said.",
      "The flexible discs and other reusable menstrual products are gaining traction as alternatives to the billions of single-use pads and tampons that get tossed into landfills every year. Products such as the discs, silicone cups and period underwear can be reused for years, so they\u2019re cost-effective and long-lasting in addition to helping people reduce waste. The popularity of the reusable alternatives has grown since the pandemic, when it was easier to experiment with period products in the privacy of a home bathroom, according to women's health experts.",
      "Celikoyar said she used tampons and pads for years because those are the options she grew up knowing about. But when she saw her friend make the switch to a menstrual disc, she decided to try it too.",
      "\u201cThe experience has been such a game changer,\u201d she said.",
      "About 12 billion disposable pads and 7 billion tampons go into U.S. landfills every year, according to Dr. Luwam Semere, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara. Pads are mostly plastic. Once they're in the landfill, they take up to 800 years to degrade, according to the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Single-use pads and tampons are by far the most popular period products. Women's health expert Dr. Navya Mysore said that's not because they're better, they're just usually the first options kids are shown.",
      "\u201cIt was often like, \u2018What did your mom use? What did your grandma use?\u2019 And that\u2019s how you were introduced into period hygiene,\u201d said Mysore, a primary care physician based in New York City.",
      "The most popular is the menstrual cup, which gets inserted much like a tampon. The discs get inserted farther in, so they don't interrupt intercourse. Both can hold several times more than a tampon and can stay inserted for up to 12 hours, instead of the four to eight hours recommended for tampons. Semere also said the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome commonly associated with tampons is much lower with menstrual cups and discs.",
      "The cons? The products require some technique to put them in right, and doing it wrong can get messy. The cups and discs also have to be cleaned regularly with soap and water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to do that if you\u2019re at work and you\u2019re in a shared, public restroom. It\u2019s not the most convenient,\u201d said Mysore.",
      "Cups prevent leakage by creating a suction, so people who use intrauterine devices for contraception risk dislodging them if they pull out a menstrual cup without breaking the seal.",
      "The placement of discs, which don\u2019t use suction, can also take some getting used to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s high up there, you don\u2019t feel it, but it can be sometimes harder for women to pull them out,\u201d said Dr. Annemieke van Eijk, an epidemiologist with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s an ease of use there for the modern woman that is significantly better than traditional methods,\u201d she said.",
      "Menstrual cups and discs typically cost between $15 and $40 and come in different shapes and sizes. They're available online and at pharmacies and big box stores.",
      "\u201cIdeally, you would like to experiment a bit with what type of cup works best for you. And the cost can be kind of prohibitive to do that,\u201d van Eijk said.",
      "A reusable product can help save money over the long term. Celikoyar estimates that she was using three tampons every day for seven days, or about 20 per month. With tampons costing 20 to 25 cents each, someone who switched to a reusable product would likely break even after a few months.",
      "For people who prefer pads, the most common reusable option is period underwear, which is comparable to regular-looking underwear with an extra absorbent lining.",
      "\u201cThose are nice because we do see people getting irritation from pad use,\" said Semere. \"Because of the different materials that are in the disposable pads.\u201d",
      "The downside, just like with pads, is the inability to tell when it's absorbed all that it can.",
      "Mysore said that's why some of her patients use the underwear as a backup, and pair them cups, discs or tampons.",
      "\u201cYou can sort of mix and match different period products, depending on how heavy your flow is and what your period is like for you,\u201d she said.",

      "Natalya Lypei, 66, a Kyiv resident, did a double-take. But the images flashing on her phone screen were real: U.S. President Donald Trump greeted Russian President Vladimir Putin warmly and clapped as the Russian leader approached him, after having been escorted into the country by four American fighter jets.",

      "\u201cHow can you welcome a tyrant like that?\u201d she asked, echoing the thoughts of many Kyiv residents.",
      "The red carpet treatment, the lack of concrete decisions for Ukraine and, most significantly, neglecting the significance of sanctions \u2014 a policy that could turn the tide in Kyiv\u2019s favor \u2014 have felt like a betrayal for Ukrainians who have borne enormous suffering in the almost three-and-a-half years since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion.",
      "Tens of thousands of Ukrainian servicemen, the country\u2019s bravest and most skilled, have been killed and wounded, thousands of civilians have been killed in Russian strikes, and a fifth of the country is under occupation, severing families, properties and Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity.",
      "On Ukrainian social media, memes of Putin and Trump walking down a red carpet strewn with dead Ukrainian bodies were widely shared.",
      "Zelenskyy had anticipated the meeting would be a boon for Putin and that there would be very little in the way of results. Speaking to reporters in the days leading up to the meeting, he said it would end up being a public relations victory for the Russian leader. Above all else, he was seeking a photo on American soil \u2014 which he got in Friday\u2019s meeting.",
      "It was the first time in a decade that Putin had stepped foot in the U.S., ending international isolation spurred by the 2022 Ukraine invasion; in other words, it was a win. For Lypei, whose serviceman son was killed last year, it was like attending another funeral, a fresh loss. This time, her country\u2019s hopes for a just peace.",

      "\u201cEverything is getting harder \u2014 the work has to be more mobile, the way we operate changes and the level of safety changes,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked whether those conditions have increased mortality among the wounded, he replied: \u201cSignificantly. There\u2019s nothing you can do. Everything burns from those FPVs \u2014 everything, even tanks.\u201d",
      "He explained that the munitions carry a charge from a rocket-propelled grenade \u2014 a shoulder-fired weapon that launches an explosive designed to pierce armored vehicles. When it blasts, a jet of molten metal and fragments penetrate the cabin at extreme temperatures. The impact can cause anything from minor cuts and burns to severe wounds, including amputations, depending on where the fragments hit and their size.",
      "Buhor said self-aid and self-evacuation are now heavily emphasized during training, but the existence of the kill zone means soldiers can be stuck in position for days or weeks \u2014 especially if a wound is not immediately life-threatening.",
      "When Artem Fursov arrived at the stabilization post late one night with three other soldiers, Buhor inspected his wounds and praised the bandage on his arm, asking who had done it. It was the work of a fellow soldier \u2014 and an example of effective self-aid, Buhor said.",
      "Fursov, 38, was wounded on Aug. 4 by an explosive dropped from a drone, but he didn\u2019t reach a medical post until five days later. To get to safety, he had to walk several kilometers. A small wooden cross he wore under his clothes the whole time now hangs against his chest.",

    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV is marking his first 100 days in office, showing a mix of continuity with and change from Pope Francis' papacy",
      "VATICAN CITY -- When Pope Leo XIV surprised tens of thousands of young people at a recent Holy Year celebration with an impromptu popemobile romp around St. Peter\u2019s Square, it almost seemed as if some of the informal spontaneity that characterized Pope Francis\u2019 12-year papacy had returned to the Vatican.",
      "But the message Leo delivered that night was all his own: In seamless English, Spanish and Italian, Leo told the young people that they were the \u201csalt of the Earth, the light of the world.\u201d He urged them to spread their hope, faith in Christ and their cries of peace wherever they go.",
      "As Robert Prevost marks his 100th day as Pope Leo this weekend, the contours of his pontificate have begun to come into relief, primarily where he shows continuity with Francis and where he signals change. Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that after 12 sometimes turbulent years under Francis, a certain calm and reserve have returned to the papacy.",
      "Leo seems eager above all to avoid polemics or making the papacy about himself, and wants instead to focus on Christ and peace.",
      "That seems exactly what many Catholic faithful want, and may respond to what today's church needs.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been very direct and forthright \u2026 but he\u2019s not doing spontaneous press hits,\u201d said Kevin Hughes, chair of theology and religious studies at Leo\u2019s alma mater, Villanova University. Leo has a different style than Francis, and that has brought relief to many, Hughes said in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cEven those who really loved Pope Francis always kind of held their breath a little bit: You didn\u2019t know what was going to come out next or what he was going to do,\u201d Hughes said.",
      "Leo has certainly gone out of his way in his first 100 days to try to heal divisions that deepened during Francis\u2019 pontificate, offering messages of unity and avoiding controversy at almost every turn. Even his signature issue \u2014 confronting the promise and peril posed by artificial intelligence \u2014 is something that conservatives and progressives alike agree is important. Francis' emphasis on caring for the environment and migrants often alienated conservatives.",
      "Closer to home, Leo offered the Holy See bureaucracy a reassuring, conciliatory message after Francis\u2019 occasionally authoritarian style rubbed some in the Vatican the wrong way.",
      "\u201cPopes come and go, but the Curia remains,\u201d Leo told Vatican officials soon after his May 8 election.",
      "Leo, though, has cemented Francis\u2019 environmental legacy by celebrating the first-ever ecologically inspired Mass. He has furthered that legacy by giving the go-ahead for the Vatican to turn a 430-hectare (1,000-acre) field north of Rome into a vast solar farm that should generate enough electricity to meet Vatican City\u2019s needs and turn it into the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral state.",
      "He has fine-tuned financial transparency regulations that Francis initiated, tweaked some other decrees to give them consistency and logic, and confirmed Francis in deciding to declare one of the 19th century\u2019s most influential saints, John Henry Newman, a \u201cdoctor\u201d of the church.",
      "But he hasn\u2019t granted any sit-down, tell-all interviews or made headline-grabbing, off-the-cuff comments like his predecessor did. He hasn\u2019t made any major appointments, including to fill his old job, or taken any big trips.",
      "In marking the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki last week, he had a chance to match Francis\u2019 novel declaration that the mere possession of nuclear weapons was \u201cimmoral.\u201d But he didn\u2019t.",
      "Compared to President Donald Trump, the other American world leader who took office in 2025 with a flurry of Sharpie-penned executive decrees, Leo has eased into his new job slowly, deliberately and quietly, almost trying not to draw attention to himself.",
      "At 69, he seems to know that he has time on his side, and that after Francis\u2019 revolutionary papacy, the church might need a bit of a breather. One Vatican official who knows Leo said he expects his papacy will have the effect of a \u201ccalming rain\u201d on the church.",
      "Maria Isabel Ibarcena Cuarite, a Peruvian member of a Catholic charismatic group, said it was precisely Leo\u2019s quiet emphasis on church traditions, its sacraments and love of Christ, that drew her and upward of 1 million young people to Rome for a special Jubilee week this month.",
      "Ibarcena said Francis had confused young people like herself with his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics and approval of blessings for same-sex couples. Such gestures went beyond what a pope was supposed to do and what the church taught, she thought.",

      "\u201cI see a kind of Augustinian flavor in the way that he\u2019s presenting all these things,\u201d said Hughes, the theology professor who is an Augustine scholar.",
      "Leo joined the Augustinians after graduating from Augustinian-run Villanova, outside Philadelphia, and was twice elected its prior general. He has visited the Augustinian headquarters outside St. Peter's a few times since his election, and some wonder if he will invite some brothers to live with him in the Apostolic Palace to recreate the spirit of Augustinian community life there.",
      "Leo is also very much a product of the Francis papacy. Francis named Prevost bishop of Chiclayo, Peru, in 2014 and then moved him to head one of the most important Vatican jobs in 2023 \u2014 vetting bishop nominations. In retrospect, it seems Francis had his eye on Prevost as a possible successor.",
      "Given Francis\u2019 stump speech before the 2013 conclave that elected him pope, the then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio essentially described Prevost in identifying the church's mission today: He said the church was \"called to go outside of itself and go to the peripheries, not just geographic but also the existential peripheries.\u201d",
      "Prevost, who hails from Chicago, spent his adult life as a missionary in Peru, eventually becoming bishop of Chiclayo.",
      "\u201cHe is the incarnation of the \u2018unity of difference,\u2019 because he comes from the center, but he lives in the peripheries,\u201d said Emilce Cuda, secretary of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.",
      "Cuda said during a recent conference hosted by Georgetown University that Leo encapsulated in \u201cword and gesture\u201d the type of missionary church Francis promoted.",
      "That said, for all Leo owes to Bergoglio, the two didn\u2019t necessarily get along.",
      "Prevost has recounted that at one point when he was the Augustinian superior, the then-archbishop of Buenos Aires expressed interest in assigning an Augustinian priest to a specific job in his archdiocese.",
      "\u201cAnd I, as prior general, said \u2018I understand, Your Eminence, but he\u2019s got to do something else\u2019 and so I transferred him somewhere else,\u201d Prevost told parishioners in his home state of Illinois in 2024.",
      "Prevost said he \u201cnaively\u201d thought the Francis wouldn\u2019t remember him after his 2013 election, and that regardless \u201che\u2019ll never appoint me bishop\u201d due to the disagreement.",
      "Bergoglio not only made him bishop, he laid the groundwork for Prevost to succeed him as pope, the first North American pope following the first South American.",

He positions himself as a \u201cpoint of balance\u201d between the far right and the far left \u2014 a fierce ideological battle that dominates Chile\u2019s political scene.",

While it's unlikely he will secure the necessary support to run for president \u2014 he has collected a little over 600 of the 35,000 signatures required \u2014 he sees his political foray as a success.",
      "Solorza keeps a tight schedule, balancing an acting career with a day job at a construction company. In his limited free time, he spends time visiting Congress, talking with members of the Parliament and meeting with constituents to promote his campaign.",
      "On the streets of Huechuraba, a quiet and green neighborhood in the northern part of Chile's capital, Solorza is often greeted by supporters, fans, and workers from restaurants and caf\u00e9s where he is a regular.

      "The Bayeux Tapestry, a medieval masterpiece depicting the 1066 Norman conquest of England, is set for a new chapter",
      "BAYEUX, France -- For centuries, the storytelling masterpiece has been a source of wonder and fascination. In vivid and gruesome detail, the 70-meter (230-foot) embroidered cloth recounts how a fierce duke from France conquered England in 1066, reshaping British and European history.",
      "The Bayeux Tapestry, with its scenes of sword-wielding knights in ferocious combat and King Harold of England's famous death, pierced by an arrow to an eye, has since the 11th century served as a sobering parable of military might, vengeance, betrayal and the complexity of Anglo-French relations, long seeped with blood and rivalry but also affection and cooperation.",
      "Now, the medieval forerunner of today's comic strips, commissioned as propaganda for the Normandy duke William known as \u201cthe Conqueror\u201d after he took the English throne from Harold, is being readied for a new narrative mission.",
      "Next year, the fragile artistic and historic treasure will be gingerly transported from its museum in Bayeux, Normandy, to star in a blockbuster exhibition in London's British Museum, from September 2026 to July 2027.",
      "Its first U.K. outing in almost 1,000 years will testify to the warming latest chapter in ties across the English Channel that chilled with the U.K.'s acrimonous departure from the European Union in 2020. The loan was announced in July when French President Emmanuel Macron became the first EU head of state to pay a state visit to the U.K. since Brexit.",
      "Bayeux Museum curator Antoine Verney says the cross-Channel trip will be a home-coming of sorts for the tapestry, because historians widely believe that it was embroidered in England, using woolen threads on linen canvas, and because William's victory at the Battle of Hastings was such a major juncture in English history, seared into the U.K.'s collective consciousness.",
      "\u201cFor the British, the date \u2014 the only date \u2014 that all of them know is 1066,\u201d Verney said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Moving an artwork so unwieldy \u2014 made from nine pieces of linen fabric stitched together and showing 626 characters, 37 buildings, 41 ships and 202 horses and mules in a total of 58 scenes \u2014 is further complicated by its great age and the wear-and-tear of time.",
      "\u201cThere is always a risk. The goal is for those risks to be as carefully calculated as possible,\u201d said Verney, the curator.",
      "Believed to have been commissioned by Bishop Odo, William the Conqueror\u2019s half-brother, to decorate a new cathedral in Bayeux in 1077, the treasure is thought to have remained there, mostly stored in a wooden chest and almost unknown, for seven centuries, surviving the French Revolution, fires and other perils.",
      "Since then, only twice is the embroidery known to have been exhibited outside of the Normandy city: Napoleon Bonaparte had it shown off in Paris' Louvre Museum from late 1803 to early 1804. During World War II, it was displayed again in the Louvre in late 1944, after Allied forces that had landed in Normandy on D-Day, June 6th, of that year had fought onward to Paris and liberated it.",

      "Following the news of the Canadian government forcing arbitration on Saturday, Reyt also expressed concern for Air Canada\u2019s flight attendants. \u201cI think the flight attendants are making some reasonable arguments,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes the intervention isn't \"a way just to silence them.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding",
      "WASHINGTON -- A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.",
      "In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency's new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet\u2019s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.",
      "Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers\u2019 Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.",
      "\u201cI think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they\u2019re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that\u2019s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that\u2019s been wasted,\" he said.",
      "Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.",
      "A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That's a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university's Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,\u201d Keoleian said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.\u201d",
      "Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump's criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail.",
      "Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said \u201cit didn't make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force.\" She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.",
      "Ernst has called the EV initiative a \u201cboondoggle\u201d and \"a textbook example of waste,\u201d citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.",
      "\u201cYou always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that\u2019s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,\" Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.",
      "\u201cFor now,\u201d she added, \"gas-powered vehicles \u2014 use some ethanol in them \u2014 I think is wonderful.\u201d",
      "Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa's farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.",
      "Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project \"has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.\u201d",
      "The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was \u201cvery modest\" and not unexpected.",
      "\u201cThe production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,\u201d spokesperson Kim Frum said.",
      "The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.",
      "The \u201cDeliver for America\u201d plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.",

      "The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. By 2024, the agency was awarded a Presidential Sustainability Award for its efforts to electrify the largest fleet in the federal government.",

      "There's also a new creature comfort: air conditioning.",
      "Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. He marvels at how Oshkosh designed and built a new vehicle, transforming an old North Carolina warehouse into a factory along the way.",
      "\u201cI was in that building when it was nothing but shelving,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house \u2014 they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly \u2014 it\u2019s really amazing in my opinion.\u201d",
      "The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. To date, it has received 300 battery vehicles and 1,000 gas-powered ones.",
      "Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in 2022 the agency expected to purchase chiefly zero-emissions delivery vehicles by 2026. It still needs some internal combustion engine vehicles that travel longer distances.",

Last month, a lawsuit was filed in Iowa after a 13-year-old girl was allegedly introduced to an adult predator on the platform, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped.",
      "In Louisiana, Livingston Parish Sheriff Jason Ard said his office has had multiple cases involving Roblox. In one, police allege a man used voice-altering technology to pose as a girl on the platform. Ard said there have yet to be any arrests made related to the gaming site.",
      "Ultimately, Murrill said she believes Roblox should be shut down.",
      "An email seeking comment was sent to the company Thursday.",
      "The free online gaming platform has more than 111 million monthly users. Its website describes Roblox as \"the ultimate virtual universe that lets you create, share experiences with friends, and be anything you can imagine.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Small-scale solar panels about the size of a door are poised to be plugged into more U.S. homes and apartments as homeowners and renters who want to harness the sun\u2019s energy look for cheaper alternatives to rooftop installations",
      "When Terrence Dwyer received a knock on his door and a flyer for a solar panel system small enough to fit on his deck, he was quickly sold. Solar systems that plug into regular wall outlets have been popular in Europe for years and are gaining traction in the U.S. for their affordability and simple installation.",
      "\u201cWe thought absolutely, let\u2019s do this right away,\u201d said Dwyer, who lives in Oakland, California.",
      "These small-scale solar systems could become attractive to more homeowners now that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping budget-and-policy package will scrap residential rooftop solar tax credits and may shift interest to cheaper alternatives. Even before the GOP bill passed, manufacturers of the smaller systems known as plug-in or balcony solar were seeing increased demand and other positive signs such as a new Utah law streamlining regulations for homeowners to buy and install them. The systems about the size of a door haven\u2019t been as widely adopted in the U.S. as in Europe because of lack of awareness, patchwork utility rules and limited availability.",
      "The $2,000 plug-in solar system installed on Dwyer's backyard deck in March consists of two 400 watt panels, an inverter, a smart meter and a circuit breaker. It saves him around $35 per month on his power bill because he is consuming less energy from the grid, but he said reducing his carbon footprint was his primary motivation.",
      "\u201cWe like the environmental benefits of solar and wanted to engage with solar in some fashion,\u201d Dwyer said.",
      "Had Dwyer opted for rooftop solar, he would have paid $20,000 for the system and $30,000 to upgrade his roof to support the panels.",
      "Installing a plug-in solar system requires some homework. What power companies let customers do with energy-generating equipment varies, which is why prospective purchasers should check their utility\u2019s policies first. Building permits might be required depending on the municipality. Some systems can be self-installed, while others may require an electrician. For example, some kits have meters that must be wired into a home's circuit breaker.",
      "Dwyer bought his system from Bright Saver, a nonprofit company in California that advocates for plug-in solar. In addition to the type Dwyer bought, the company also offers a smaller model costing $399 that recently sold out in six days.",
      "\u201cThe interest and demand have been overwhelming,\u201d said Cora Stryker, a founder of Bright Saver. \u201cIt is clear that we are hitting a nerve \u2014 many Americans have wanted solar for a long time but have not had an option that is feasible and affordable for them until now.\u201d",
      "Kevin Chou, another founder of Bright Saver, said wider adoption of the systems in the U.S. has been hindered by utility policies that create uncertainty about whether they're allowed and a lack of state and local policies to make clear what rules apply.",
      "Some utilities contacted by The Associated Press say plug-in solar systems require the same interconnection applications as rooftop panels that send electricity back to the wider network. But Steven Hegedus, an electrical engineering professor at University of Delaware, said he doesn't understand why a utility would need to require an interconnection agreement for plug-in solar because, unlike rooftop systems, they are designed to prevent energy from flowing to the grid.",
      "Still, if in doubt, a customer should follow their utility's policy.",
      "During the early days of plug-in solar's growth, some opposition from utilities is likely since customers are buying less energy, said Robert Cudd, a research analyst at the California Center for Sustainable Communities at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cUtilities really prefer everyone being a predictable and generous consumer of the electricity they sell,\u201d Cudd said.",
      "This year, Utah enacted a novel law supporting plug-in solar by exempting certain small-scale systems from interconnection agreements and establishing safety requirements such as being certified by a nationally recognized testing organization such as Underwriters Laboratories. It appears to be the only state that's passed legislation supporting plug-in solar, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Republican state Rep. Raymond Ward, who sponsored the legislation, said the smaller systems allow people to better manage where their energy comes from and what they pay.",
      "\u201cEurope has these things. You can go buy them and they work and people want them. There is no reason why we shouldn\u2019t have them here in the United States,\u201d Ward said.",

      "Some questions remain about how much customers could save. Severin Borenstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business, said the cost of some portable solar systems in the U.S. would make it hard for customers to come out ahead on their utility bills over the time they own them. He estimates the price of a $2,000 system in the U.S. works out to paying about $0.20 a kilowatt-hour over a 25-year period, which only saves people money if they have high utility costs. By comparison, Borenstein said the cost of systems sold in Europe, typically around $600, is equivalent to paying about $0.05 or $0.06 per kilowatt-hour over 25 years.",
      "Baltimore resident Craig Keenan said saving money was only part of why he installed one of the smaller Bright Saver models on his balcony in July.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m interested in renewable energy because the amount of carbon emissions that we produce as a species is very, very unsustainable for our world,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cI think anyone can install this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not complicated. It doesn\u2019t require a technical degree.\u201d",
      "Other companies selling plug-in solar kits include Texas-based Craftstrom. It has sold about 2,000 systems in the U.S. since 2021, mostly in California, Texas and Florida. The company's basic kits contain a solar panel that can fit in a backyard or other sunny space, along with equipment to maintain and regulate the flow of energy including an inverter and smart meter.",
      "Kenneth Hutchings, Craftstrom\u2019s chief revenue officer, said their U.S. sales rose this year even before the passage of the GOP tax bill, and he expects demand for plug-in solar to increase further as federal rooftop solar credits expire.",

      "China-based EcoFlow plans to begin selling plug-in solar systems in Utah and expand to other states if supportive legislation is passed, said Ryan Oliver, a company spokesperson.",

      "The Lithuanian banks do not operate in China, giving Beijing\u2019s move a largely symbolic character. Nonetheless, the tit-for-tat measures underscore deepening tensions between the EU and China over Beijing's support for Russia in its war on Ukraine.",

      "He said the Commission does not believe that the Chinese countermeasures \u201chave any justification or are evidence based, and therefore we call on China to remove them even now.\u201d",
      "The EU\u2019s latest Russia sanctions package, adopted in July and effective August 9, included Heihe Rural Commercial Bank and Heilongjiang Suifenhe Rural Commercial Bank. The bloc accused them of providing crypto-asset services that help Moscow evade restrictions.",
      "In explaining its sanctions on the Lithuanian banks, the Chinese Ministry said the EU sanctions on Chinese firms had \"a serious negative impact on China-EU economic and trade relations and financial cooperation.\u201d",
      "The banks and the government in Lithuania said the sanctions were not expected but would likely have little practical impact.",
      "\u201cAccording to the preliminary assessment, this decision will not have a significant impact on either the country\u2019s financial system or the activities of the banks themselves, since the business models of the mentioned banks are focused on the local market,\u201d the Bank of Lithuania said on Wednesday in a statement.",

      "Elevated mortgage rates have helped keep the U.S. housing market in a sales slump since early 2022, when rates started to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic. Home sales sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "This is the fourth week in a row that rates have come down. The latest average rate on a 30-year mortgage is now at its lowest level since Oct. 24, when it averaged 6.54%.",

Many investors comb through Berkshire's filings every quarter because they like to follow Buffett's moves. His record of trouncing the S&P 500 for decades has inspired legions of followers.",

      "The Allegheny County Health Department announced that mobile air units provided by the state and Carnegie Mellon University will be stationed in the Mon Valley where the plant is Thursday and Friday. The county said these measures are part of its ongoing investigation into Monday's explosion at Clairton Coke Works.",

      "Target and Ulta Beauty are parting ways, ending a partnership launched in 2021 that created in-store shops filled with beauty products at hundreds of the discounter\u2019s stores",
      "NEW YORK -- Target and Ulta Beauty are parting ways, ending a partnership launched in 2021 that created in-store shops filled with beauty products at hundreds of the discounter's stores.",
      "According to a joint release issued Thursday, the companies said they have \u201cmutually agreed\" not to renew their pact, which concludes in August 2026. Until then, the Ulta Beauty experience at Target will continue in Target stores and on Target.com, the release said.",
      "Ulta is currently in 600 of Target's roughly 1,980 stores, according to a Target spokesperson.",
      "\u201cFor 35 years, Ulta Beauty has revolutionized how people experience beauty \u2014 bringing together an unmatched assortment from mass to luxury \u2014 and our partnership with Target was one of many unique ways we have brought the power of beauty to guests nationwide,\u201d said Amiee Bayer-Thomas, chief retail officer of Ulta Beauty, in a statement.",
      "Rick Gomez, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Target, said in a statement he was committed to \"offering the beauty experience consumers have come to expect from Target.\u201d",
      "The partnership was announced in 2020 and came as the coronavirus pandemic upended shopping habits and more people tried to minimize potential exposure to the virus through one-stop shopping. COVID had dampened sales of lipstick as people wore masks, but the skincare business enjoyed stronger sales.",
      "The shops are about 1,000 square feet and carry makeup, skincare, and fragrance and operated beside existing beauty sections in Target stores. The deal was a way for both Target and Ulta to increase their customer base.",

      "Darnold, who signed to a three-year, $100.5 million contract with Seattle in the offseason, made good use of both his legs and his tight ends during his sole series. He had no issues rolling out to either his left or right, locating tight ends AJ Barner and Elijah Arroyo for short passes, as well as fullback Robbie Ouzts and wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba for deeper completions.",
      "\u201cI thought today, first of all, it was awesome just to get out there in front of the 12s,\u201d Darnold said. \u201cAnd that atmosphere, too, I felt like that was kind of a perfect atmosphere. It felt like it was almost November, December already out there in the rain.\u201d",
      "Backup quarterback Drew Lock also impressed in relief of Darnold on a slippery Seattle evening, throwing a couple of touchdown passes to wide receiver Jake Bobo, and completing 10 of 12 passes for 129 yards. Coach Mike Macdonald was particularly complimentary of Bobo\u2019s performance.",
      "\u201cThis guy\u2019s a Seahawk, man,\u201d Macdonald said of Bobo, \u201cThe way he operates and goes and attacks the football.\"",
      "Running backs Zach Charbonnet and Damien Martinez each added touchdowns on the ground in the first and third quarters, respectively.",

      "Backup quarterback Gardner Minshew found tight end Robert Tonyan for a 1-yard touchdown catch in the second quarter.",
      "The Seahawks\u2019 defense in large part held strong, limiting the Chiefs\u2019 reserves to three points in the second half. Kansas City wide receiver Skyy Moore, though, did return a punt for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter.",
      "\u201cNow, we\u2019re chasing perfection as much as you can\u2019t obtain it,\u201d safety Julian Love said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re trying to make the standard on defense.\u201d",

      "\u201cObviously, for us 1's you want a different result,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt (stinks), but that\u2019s preseason football. You kind of get that sample size. Obviously, you want to go well early, get it done fast. We didn\u2019t get it done today. Of course, we will go watch film tomorrow and go from that.\u201d",

      "Coastal communities nationwide ramp up efforts to protect their shorelines.",
      "In San Francisco Bay, salt ponds created more than a century ago are reverting to marshland. Along the New York and New Jersey coasts, beaches ravaged by Superstorm Sandy underwent extensive restoration. In Alabama, a rebuilt spit of land is shielding a historic town and providing wildlife habitat.",
      "Coastal communities nationwide are ramping up efforts to fend off rising seas, higher tides and stronger storm surges that are chewing away at coastlines, pushing saltwater farther inland and threatening ecosystems and communities.",
      "The need for coastal restoration has been in the spotlight this month after Louisiana officials canceled a $3 billion project because of objections from the fishing industry and concerns about rising costs. The Mid-Barataria project was projected to rebuild more than 20 square miles (32 square kilometers) of land over about 50 years by diverting sediment-laden water from the Mississippi River.",
      "But work continues on many other projects in Louisiana and around the country, including barrier islands, saltwater marshes, shellfish reefs and other natural features that provided protection before they were destroyed or degraded by development. Communities are also building flood walls, berms and levees to protect areas that lack adequate natural protection.",
      "The work has become more urgent as climate change causes more intense and destructive storms and leads to sea-level rise that puts hundreds of communities and tens of millions of people at risk, scientists say.",
      "\u201cThe sooner we can make these coastlines more resilient the better,\u201d said Doug George, a geological oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "In the U.S., perhaps nowhere is more vulnerable than the hurricane-prone Gulf Coast. Louisiana alone has lost more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of coastline \u2014 more than any other state \u2014 over the past century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Historically, sediment deposited by the Mississippi and other rivers rebuilt land and nourished shore-buffering marshes. But that function was disrupted by the construction of channels and levees, along with other development.",
      "The dangers were magnified in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina breached flood walls and levees, submerging 80% of New Orleans and killing almost 1,400 people \u2014 followed closely by Hurricane Rita.",
      "Afterward, the state formed the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to lessen risks from storm surges and stem land loss.",
      "Most of the almost $18 billion spent in the past 20 years was to shore up levees, flood walls and other structures, the authority said.",
      "Dozens of other projects are completed, planned or underway, including rebuilding marshes and other habitat with sediment dredged from waterways and restoring river flow to areas that have lacked it for years.",
      "On Louisiana\u2019s Chandeleur Islands, a barrier island chain, the state will pump in sand to help rebuild them, which will dampen storm surges and benefit sea turtles and other wildlife, said Katie Freer-Leonards, who leads development of the state\u2019s 2029 coastal master plan.",
      "The authority is digging a channel to allow water and sediment from the Mississippi River to flow into part of Maurepas Swamp, a roughly 218-square-mile forested wetland northwest of New Orleans that has been \u201cdying for over a century\u201d because of levees, project manager Brad Miller said.",

      "DENVER -- Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will again live with less water from the Colorado River as drought lingers in the West, federal officials announced Friday.",
      "The Colorado River is a critical lifeline to seven U.S. states, 30 Native American tribes, and two Mexican states. The cuts are based on projections for levels at federal reservoirs \u2014 chief among them Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u2014 released every August by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "Arizona will again go without 18% of its total Colorado River allocation, while Mexico loses 5%. The reduction for Nevada \u2014 which receives far less water than Arizona, California or Mexico \u2014 will stay at 7%. California won't face any cuts because it has senior water rights and is the last to lose in times of shortage.",
      "Decades of overuse and the effects of long-term drought worsened by climate change means there\u2019s far more demand for water than what actually flows through the river. Low reservoir levels at Lake Mead have triggered mandatory cutbacks every year since 2022, with the deepest cuts in 2023, which hit farmers in Arizona the hardest.",
      "Meanwhile, the states are working to reach agreement by next year on new long-term rules to govern the river in dry years. The Trump administration gave a mid-November deadline for states to reach a preliminary agreement, or risk federal intervention. Negotiations have faced delays as states push back against how much water they should each give up.",
      "The original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on an amount of water that doesn't exist in today's climate. That leaves the Upper Basin states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah to share far less water after the required amount is sent to the to the \u201cLower Basin\u201d states of Nevada, Arizona and California. Lots of water is also lost to evaporation and leaky infrastructure.",
      "Fairly splitting the river's water in the era of climate change has been vexing for years, with all of the major users hesitant to give anything up as they anticipate a drier future. There has to be enough water in the reservoirs to reach the tunnels that usher water downstream, and ideally, even more water for hydropower generation. Key infrastructure like the Hoover Dam rely on certain water levels in Lake Mead to generate electricity.",
      "Mandatory cuts and emergency water releases are \u201creactive,\" said John Berggren, a regional policy manager at Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit focused on climate change.",

      "The species prefers swimming in warmer waters, usually traveling only as far north as the Carolinas. If the manatee stays in water that is too cold for too long, it could suffer severe illness or death, said New England Aquarium Research Scientist Dr. Nadine Lysiak.",
      "Additionally, manatees are herbivores that sustain themselves on extensive seagrass beds and mangroves not typically found in New England.",

      "Lysiak said it's unclear how and why the manatee found its way so far north. It may have followed the warm water Gulf Stream current system from Florida up past the Carolinas and eventually found its way to New England, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have kind of an average understanding of what a wild population does in terms of their range, or their habitat range, and some individuals will go beyond that and maybe wander or seek out other habitats or other food sources,\" she said. \"It\u2019s hard to know exactly why this manatee came to Cape Cod.\u201d",

      "Scientists from a university are filtering Mexico City's waters for traces of the DNA of an endangered salamander, the axolotl",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Sixty years ago, residents of a canal-crossed borough in Mexico City could pluck axolotls \u2014 the large salamander reminiscent of a tiny dragon \u2014 out of the water with their hands because they were so plentiful. Now it\u2019s almost impossible to find them in the wild.",
      "That's why scientists from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University are filtering Xochimilco\u2019s murky waters for traces of the endangered creature\u2019s DNA.",
      "\u201cWe all shed DNA along our path across the world and that can be captured by filtering air or water,\u201d said biologist Luis Zambrano, from the university's ecological restoration lab.",
      "As they try to monitor the axolotls\u2019 dwindling numbers, scientists increasingly rely on this technique as their nets come back empty during periodic surveys of the population, which is only found in Xochimilco.",
      "They sample water taken from the canals and filter it for environmental DNA, or the genetic particles left by animals and plants that have contact with the water. That\u2019s then compared to the profiles contained in a genetic library put together some years ago by British scientists, said Esther Quintero of Conservation International in Mexico, which has collaborated with Zambrano since 2023.",
      "Scientists collected water from 53 locations in Xochimilco: 10 inside refuges where water is filtered and the water is cleaner and 43 outside those areas. They found axolotl DNA inside the protected areas and in one site outside them.",
      "Referring to the one unprotected area, Zambrano said \u201cit\u2019s very little,\u201d but a sign that there is the possibility of resilience, even with continuing environmental degradation and pollution of the canals.",
      "So far, the researchers have only searched a third of Xochimilco with the environmental DNA technique and the manual work with nets, but they plan to continue the work and hopefully present an updated census early next year.",
      "The trend, however, is not good. From an estimated 6,000 axolotls per square kilometer in 1998, there were only 36 per square kilometer in the last census, in 2014.",

      "But policymakers can do more, he said, such as prohibiting the opening of dance clubs, spas and soccer fields on Xochimilco\u2019s traditional man-made islands, known as chinampas. Instead, the government should incentivize the islands\u2019 traditional agricultural production, ensuring that farmers can actually make a living at it.",
      "If its habitat is fixed, the axolotl can take care of the rest.",

      "\"People over-assign impact to actually pretty low-impact actions such as recycling, and underestimate the actual carbon impact of behaviors much more carbon intensive, like flying or eating meat,\" said Madalina Vlasceanu, report co-author and professor of environmental social sciences at Stanford University.",
      "The top three individual actions that help the climate, including avoiding plane flights, choosing not to get a dog and using renewable electricity, were also the three that participants underestimated the most. Meanwhile, the lowest-impact actions were changing to more efficient appliances and swapping out light bulbs, recycling, and using less energy on washing clothes. Those were three of the top four overestimated actions in the report.",
      "Vlasceanu said marketing focuses more on recycling and using energy-efficient light bulbs than on why flights or dog adoption are relatively bad for the climate, so participants were more likely to give those actions more weight.",

      "Zhao added it's easier to bring actions to mind that we do more often. \u201cRecycling is an almost daily action, whereas flying is less frequent. It\u2019s less discussed,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, people give a higher psychological weight to recycling.\u201d",

      "Dogs are big meat eaters, and meat is a significant contributor to climate change. That is because many of the farm animals, which will become food, release methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Beef is especially impactful, in part because around the world cattle are often raised on land that was illegally deforested. Since trees absorb carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas, cutting them to then raise cattle is a double whammy.",

      "Switching to energy that comes from renewable sources, such as solar and wind, has a large positive impact because such sources don't emit greenhouse gases. Some of the biggest climate decisions individuals can make include how they heat and cool their homes and the types of transportation they use. Switching to renewable energy minimizes the impact of both.",
      "Recycling is effective at reducing waste headed for landfill, but its climate impact is relatively small because transporting, processing and repurposing recyclables typically relies on fossil fuels. Plus, less than 10% of plastics actually get recycled, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Other decisions with overestimated impact, including washing clothes in cold water and switching to more efficient light bulbs, are relatively less important.

      "Farmers in Kenya face challenges with elephants raiding crops and sometimes causing harm",
      "TAITA TAVETA, Kenya -- For farmers in the Taita hills in southern Kenya, elephants are a menace: they raid crops and will occasionally injure or even kill people.",
      "Farmer Richard Shika, 68, has had some close encounters. \u201cOne time, I was trying to chase away an elephant that was in my maize field, but it turned and charged me,\u201d Shika remembers. \u201cIt stopped when it was right in front of me, and I managed to jump out of the way.\u201d",
      "He feels lucky to be alive. Almost exactly two years ago, local media reported that a 3-year-old girl had been trampled to death by an elephant in Taita Taveta county, her mother injured.",
      "The area where Shika has his farm is almost surrounded by Kenya\u2019s biggest National Park. The border of Tsavo East National Park is less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the east, and Tsavo West curves around to the north, west and south. The parks have always been unfenced, allowing animals to migrate. Increasingly, that puts them in the path of humans.",
      "\u201cThe places and infrastructure that we humans develop hinder the migratory routes and paths which elephants used to take,\u201d explains Yuka Luvonga, who researches human-elephant coexistence for conservation organization Save The Elephants.",
      "Elephants eat about 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of vegetation a day, so keeping them off farms is tricky, especially if forage is scarce elsewhere. \u201cElephants are clever creatures,\u201d says Shika. \u201cThey will try touching a fence, and once they realize that it is not electrified, they charge through.\u201d",
      "If farmers try to chase them off, as Shika did, the elephants will sometimes turn and defend themselves. Kenya Wildlife Service and conservation organizations tracking human-elephant conflict estimate that 30-35 people are killed every year in elephant-related incidents across Kenya.",
      "Communities will sometimes retaliate by spearing or poisoning elephants, but there are other solutions, as farmers here have found.",
      "One of them is bees.",
      "\u201cElephants don\u2019t like getting stung by bees, so they keep away from areas where hives are,\u201d Shika says.",
      "With help from Save The Elephants, Shika is one of 50 farmers who have hung beehives from wires between poles around their farms. If an elephant touches the wire, the hives are rocked, disturbing the bees. It\u2019s an army of tiny security guards that keeps elephants well away from the farm.",
      "\u201cWith hives acting as a fence, I can continue crop-farming and also earn a livelihood from honey,\u201d Shika says. This year, he\u2019s made almost $250 selling honey.",
      "Changing crops can also make a difference. Elephants love maize and watermelons. But sesame? Blegh.",

    "story": [
      "Delivery drones are supposed to be fast, yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States",
      "Delivery drones are so fast they can zip a pint of ice cream to a customer\u2019s driveway before it melts.",
      "Yet the long-promised technology has been slow to take off in the United States. More than six years after the Federal Aviation Administration approved commercial home deliveries with drones, the service mostly has been confined to a few suburbs and rural areas.",
      "That could soon change. The FAA proposed a new rule last week that would make it easier for companies to fly drones outside of an operator's line of sight and therefore over longer distances. A handful of companies do that now, but they had to obtain waivers and certification as an air carrier to deliver packages.",
      "While the rule is intended to streamline the process, authorized retailers and drone companies that have tested fulfilling orders from the sky say they plan to make drone-based deliveries available to millions more U.S. households.",
      "Walmart and Wing, a drone company owned by Google parent Alphabet, currently provide deliveries from 18 Walmart stores in the Dallas area. By next summer, they expect to expand to 100 Walmart stores in Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Houston; and Orlando and Tampa, Florida.",
      "After launching its Prime Air delivery service in College Station, Texas, in late 2022, Amazon received FAA permission last year to operate autonomous drones that fly beyond a pilot's line of sight. The e-commerce company has since expand its drone delivery program to suburban Phoenix and has plans to offer the service in Dallas, San Antonio, Texas, and Kansas City.",
      "The concept of drone delivery has been around for well over a decade. Drone maker Zipline, which works with Walmart in Arkansas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, began making deliveries to hospitals in Rwanda in 2016. Israel-based Flytrex, one of the drone companies DoorDash works with to carry out orders, launched drone delivery to households in Iceland in 2017.",
      "But Wing CEO Adam Woodworth said drone delivery has been in \u201ctreading water mode\u201d in the U.S. for years, with service providers afraid to scale up because the regulatory framework wasn\u2019t in place.",
      "\u201cYou want to be at the right moment where there\u2019s an overlap between the customer demand, the partner demand, the technical readiness and the regulatory readiness,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cI think that we\u2019re reaching that planetary alignment right now.\u201d",
      "DoorDash, which works with both Wing and Flytrex, tested drone drop-offs in rural Virginia and greater Dallas before announcing an expansion into Charlotte. Getting takeout food this way may sound futuristic, but it's starting to feel normal in suburban Brisbane, Australia, where DoorDash has employed delivery drones for several years, said Harrison Shih, who leads the company's drone program.",
      "\u201cIt comes so fast and it's something flying into your neighborhood, but it really does seem like part of everyday life,\u201d Shih said.",
      "Even though delivery drones are still considered novel, the cargo they carry can be pretty mundane. Walmart said the top items from the more than 150,000 drone deliveries the nation's largest retailer has completed since 2021 include ice cream, eggs and Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups.",
      "Unlike traditional delivery, where one driver may have a truck full of packages, drones generally deliver one small order at a time. Wing\u2019s drones can carry packages weighing up to 2.5 pounds. They can travel up to 12 miles round trip. One pilot can oversee up to 32 drones.",
      "Zipline has a drone that can carry up to 4 pounds and fly 120 miles round trip. Some drones, like Amazon\u2019s, can carry heavier packages.",
      "Once an order is placed, it's packaged for flight and attached to a drone at a launch site. The drone automatically finds a route that avoids obstacles. A pilot observes as the aircraft flies to its destinations and lowers its cargo to the ground with retractable cords.",
      "Shakiba Enayati, an assistant professor of supply chain and analytics at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, researches ways that drones could speed the delivery of critical health supplies like donated organs and blood samples. The unmanned aircraft offer some advantages as a transport method, such as reduced emissions and improved access to goods for rural residents, Enayati said.",
      "But she also sees plenty of obstacles. Right now, it costs around $13.50 per delivery to carry a package by drone versus $2 for a traditional vehicle, Enayati said. Drones need well-trained employees to oversee them and can have a hard time in certain weather.",

She thinks the same thing could happen with drones, especially as improved technology reduces the chance for errors.",
      "Woodworth added that U.S. airspace is tightly controlled, and companies need to demonstrate to the FAA that their drones are safe and reliable before they are cleared to fly. Even under the proposed new rules, the FAA would set detailed requirements for drone operators.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why it takes so long to build a business in the space. But I think it leads to everybody fundamentally building higher quality things,\u201d Woodworth said.",
      "Others worry that drones may potentially replace human delivery drivers. Shih thinks that\u2019s unlikely. One of DoorDash's most popular items is 24-packs of water, Shih said, which aren't realistic for existing drones to ferry.",
      "\u201cI believe that drone delivery can be fairly ubiquitous and can cover a lot of things. We just don't think its probable today that it\u2019ll carry a 40-pound bag of dog food to you,\" Shih said.",
      "DoorDash said that in the areas where it offers drone deliveries, orders requiring the services of human delivery drivers also increase.",
      "That\u2019s been the experience of John Kim, the owner of PurePoke restaurant in Frisco, Texas. Kim signed on to offer drone deliveries through DoorDash last year. He doesn\u2019t know what percentage of his DoorDash customers are choosing the service instead of regular delivery, but his overall DoorDash orders are up 15% this year.",
      "Kim said he\u2019s heard no complaints from drone delivery customers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very stable, maybe even better than some of the drivers that toss it in the back with all the other orders,\u201d Kim said.",
      "For some, drones can simply be a nuisance. When the FAA asked for public comments on Amazon\u2019s request to expand deliveries in College Station, numerous residents expressed concern that drones with cameras violated their privacy. Amazon says its drones use cameras and sensors to navigate and avoid obstacles but may record overhead videos of people while completing a delivery.",
      "Other residents complained about noise.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a giant nagging mosquito,\u201d one respondent wrote. Amazon has since released a quieter drone.",
      "But others love the service. Janet Toth of Frisco, Texas, said she saw drone deliveries in Korea years ago and wondered why the U.S. didn\u2019t have them. So she was thrilled when DoorDash began providing drone delivery in her neighborhood.",
      "Toth now orders drone delivery a few times a month. Her 9-year-old daughter Julep said friends often come over to watch the drone.",
      "\u201cI love to go outside, wave at the drone, say \u2018Thank you\u2019 and get the food,\u201d Julep Toth said.",

    "story": [
      "In California\u2019s Death Valley National Park, one of the hottest places on Earth, summer temperatures can soar into the 130s F",
      "DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. -- Ray Estrada's 11-year-old grandson is used to Las Vegas' scorching summers, but he'd always wanted to experience the heat in one of the Earth's hottest places. So Estrada recently drove him to Death Valley National Park, with an umbrella, extra water and electrolytes in tow. That day, the thermometer soared to 118 F (47.78 C).",
      "\u201cWe have to be very careful when we go out there,\u201d Estrada told him. \u201cIf you start feeling dizzy or whatever... we\u2019re just gonna turn back and be safe so we can do this again another time.\u201d",
      "The extreme temperatures in this stretch of California desert attract visitors every year, some determined to finish a grueling, multiday race, others just curious about the sizzling heat and the landscape's vast beauty. Yet despite the warnings, the heat kills one to three people annually, and park rangers respond to overheated visitors multiple times per week, making communication about heat safety a priority for the National Park Service.",
      "But that's easier said than done.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to underestimate how dangerous heat is,\" said Abby Wines, the park's acting deputy superintendent. \u201cPeople are usually used to thinking of heat as something that makes them uncomfortable,\" and that they can tough it out.",
      "\u201cThis type of heat will kill,\u201d she said.",
      "Death Valley holds the record for the hottest temperature ever officially recorded \u2014 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 \u2014 although some experts have disputed it and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C) there in July 2021.",
      "In the U.S., heat kills more people than other weather events combined, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. If planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, which come from burning fuels like oil and coal, continue at their current pace, more places could experience broiling temperatures. That makes it crucial to communicate the dangers of extreme heat and safety precautions, as both can influence who lives and dies.",
      "Throughout this desert are stark warnings of the deadly heat: \u201cStop. Extreme heat danger. Walking after 10 a.m. not recommended,\u201d one sign says. \u201cHEAT KILLS!\u201d warns another. On bathroom walls there are reminders to hydrate in the form of charts displaying the color of pee \u2014 the darker the urine, the more you need to drink water.",
      "Another sign warns visitors that helicopters for medical emergencies can\u2019t safely fly amid extreme temperatures. Ambulances can often deploy in extreme heat but are not a guarantee. The safety of emergency responders is always considered.",
      "Baruch Fischhoff, professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies decision-making, said evidence shows that people generally underestimate risk when they have a sense of control. Information that explicitly says rescue might not be an option if it\u2019s too hot \u201ctakes away that sense of the control that can lead to underestimating risk.\u201d",
      "Failing to recognize those risks can be deadly. Last summer, a helicopter was unable to fly to a rescue because of 128 F (53.33 C) temperatures. A group of visitors were traveling on motorcycles when one died from the heat, and another was treated for severe heat illness and transported to a hospital.",
      "Rescue options are even more limited for hikers lost on a trail. Unless it\u2019s a short distance and rescuers know where the person is, they\u2019ll likely wait until sunset if it\u2019s above 115 F (46.11 C). \u201cDepending on their situation,\u201d Wines said, that's \u201cprobably too late.\u201d",
      "Two of the park's busiest months are in the summer, and it sees a small bump in visitors when temperatures are expected to hit the high 120s or 130s F (48.89s to 54.44s C). But it's the moderate temperatures that tend to get people into more trouble.",
      "\u201cWe actually have a harder time communicating our concerns about heat to the public when they visit and it\u2019s only 100 to 115,\" Wines said. The dryness evaporates sweat almost instantly, so many people don't realize how much they're actually sweating.",
      "Then there's the vastness. Death Valley has more than 50 entrances, so many visitors aren't seeing rangers who can relay important information. Instead, they place heat warning signs in the hottest and most popular spots. But they discovered that people responded less to heat warning signs that looked permanent compared to those that seemed temporary.",

      "For Marc Green, an expert in experimental psychology, that finding is \u201c100% predictable.\u201d",

      "Jennifer Marlon, senior research scientist at the Yale School of the Environment, has studied public perceptions of the health risks of extreme heat across the U.S. How people perceive heat and other climate risks varies by factors like age, race, gender, income level and where they live. Older white men, for instance, tend to have lower risk perceptions across the board, whereas women have higher risk perceptions than men.",
      "\u201cThe challenge, though, is that the level of worry or risk perception doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into action,\u201d Marlon said. Optimism bias could also falsely make a person believe the heat won\u2019t personally affect them. While studies show that experience with heat increases people\u2019s concern, it is short-lived.",
      "\u201cYou get a bump for like a year or so after a really big event and then it just goes right back to the baseline,\u201d she said.",
      "Marlon said to be specific. Don't just tell people that heat can be lethal, tell them what could happen to their bodies and what to do to stay safe.",
      "Death Valley park does this. On site and online, park officials tell visitors to avoid hiking at low elevations after 10 a.m., to stay on paved roads and near their cars. They say to drink and carry plenty of water, and to seek shade and hydrate if you feel dizzy, nauseous or have a headache.",
      "And while this isn't something the park would initiate, if scientists gave names to heat waves, similar to how hurricanes are named, that could better grab people\u2019s attention because human brains are attuned to novelty, Marlon said.",
      "The messenger is also important. If friends, family and neighbors are worried and nudging you to do something, that can be more powerful than reading information online. Community leaders modeling appropriate behavior \u2014 like saying they\u2019re evacuating their family ahead of a hurricane or that they carry extra water in their trunk \u2014 can also go a long way.",
      "Marlon also suggested communicating how extreme heat can impair the ability to think clearly. When communicating with images, show people drinking water, putting on cold wet towels or resting in shade.",
      "\u201cWhatever the recommended behavior is, show them pictures of that behavior because we\u2019re incredibly and fundamentally social animals, and body language is so much of how we communicate,\u201d Marlon said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The much-anticipated summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin began with a warm welcome and a flyover by screaming jets at a U.S. military base in Alaska but ended with a thud Friday after they conceded that they had failed to reach any agreements on how to end the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "After about 2 1/2 hours of talks at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, the two men appeared before reporters for what had been billed as a joint news conference \u2014 but they took no questions.",
      "\u201cWe had an extremely productive meeting and many points were agreed to, there are just a very few that are left,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.\u201d",
      "Putin, welcomed into the U.S. after being shunned by Western allies since early 2022 for ordering the invasion of Ukraine, thanked Trump for hosting the meeting and suggested with a chuckle that the next time the two sit down it could be in Moscow.",
      "Here are key takeaways from the summit:",
      "Putin got a red carpet welcome and even rode in Trump\u2019s presidential limousine from the tarmac to the summit venue. There, the pair were joined by two of their top aides: Secretary of State and national security adviser Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff for Trump and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and national security adviser Yuri Ushakov for Putin.",
      "Putin, who spoke first after the meeting concluded, lauded the historical relationship between the United States, Russia and the former Soviet Union, recalling joint missions conducted by the two countries during World War II.",
      "He said the U.S. and Russia share values, a standard talking point for Russian officials when trying to woo Trump and his aides. Putin also noted that Trump has frequently said the Ukraine war wouldn\u2019t have happened had he won the 2020 election.",
      "\"I think that would have been the case,\" the Russian leader said, a comment sure to please Trump.",
      "However, there is no indication and no way to prove that Moscow would have acted differently toward Ukraine had Democrat Joe Biden not been elected.",
      "Trump had gone into the meeting hoping to get Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine \u2014 or at least a commitment from Russia to enter into negotiations to reach one.",
      "Instead, Trump conceded that \u201cwe haven\u2019t quite got there\u201d and said he would be conferring with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO leaders about next steps.",
      "Trump said he and Putin had made some significant progress toward the goal of ending the conflict but gave no details on what that entailed and had to acknowledge that they had been unable to bridge substantial gaps.",
      "\u201cI believe we had a very productive meeting,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t quite got there, but we\u2019ve made some headway. So, there\u2019s no deal until there\u2019s a deal.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere is nothing new under the sun regarding the facts or the law. The Court therefore could deny Defendants\u2019 motion on that basis alone,\" Gee wrote, referring to the government's appeal to a law they believed kept the court from enforcing the agreement.",

      "The agreement set standards for how licensed shelters must provide food, water, adult supervision, emergency medical services, toilets, sinks, temperature control and ventilation. It also limited how long U.S. Customs and Border Protection could detain child immigrants to 72 hours. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services then takes custody of the children.",

In May, CBP held 46 children for over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. In March and April, CPB reported that it had 213 children in custody for more than 72 hours. That included 14 children, including toddlers, who were held for over 20 days in April.",

      "Kylan Darnell is a TikTok star known for documenting sorority recruitment, but she decided to step back from posting this year",
      "TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- Kylan Darnell became an overnight celebrity in the TikTok niche that documents the glitzy, ritualistic recruitment process for sororities. As a 21-year-old rising senior four years later, she's taking more of her sorority life offline.",
      "Darnell has until now been the embodiment of RushTok, a week-long marathon that has teens at schools around the country meticulously documenting their efforts to land a cherished spot in a sorority during the colorful, girly and enigmatic recruitment process known as rush week.",
      "Reactions to the content that once catapulted her to fame \u2014 depicting her life as a Zeta Tau Alpha member at the University of Alabama \u2014 had become so negative that it was affecting her mental health, she said.",
      "\u201cThis year it was just like a whole different level of hate,\" Darnell said.",
      "Citing a need to protect prospects from harassment, many sororities have made similar moves, issuing a de facto ban against talking to the press or posting on social media during rush week at Alabama, where almost 13,000 students participate in the nation's largest on-campus Greek life.",
      "Across the country, rush is typically a 10-day event where \u201cprospective new members\u201d try out sororities through rounds of activities prescribing a strict slate of outfits and etiquette. In the lead-up, girls often submit \"social resumes\" and letters of recommendation from sorority alums.",
      "Participation often requires an eye-opening price tag.",
      "After spending sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on outfits, makeup and plane tickets, each of this week's 2,600 recruits paid $550 to participate. It's non-refundable if they don't get picked. If accepted, they'll pay an average $8,400 a semester to live in the sorority house, or $4,100 if they live elsewhere, according to the Alabama Panhellenic Association.",
      "The pressure can be so intense that an industry of consultants now helps girls navigate the often mysterious criteria for landing a desired sorority. Some charge up to $10,000 for months of services that can begin in high school.",
      "Throughout rush, many events are invite-only. At any point, girls can get a dreaded call informing them they\u2019ve been dropped \u2014 that a sorority is no longer interested in letting them join. Matches are finally made on bid day as prospects rank top choices and sororities make offers.",
      "Morgan Cadenhead, now 20, gained such an audience on RushTok despite being dropped that she covered most of her tuition with income from social media.

Today, Black students outside of traditionally Black sororities and fraternities represent 2% of the total Greek membership, the university website says.",

      "The future of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon has split the United States and its European allies with implications for security in the Middle East",
      "WASHINGTON -- The future of U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon has split the United States and its European allies, raising implications for security in the Middle East and becoming the latest snag to vex relations between the U.S. and key partners like France, Britain and Italy.",
      "At issue is the peacekeeping operation known as UNIFIL, whose mandate expires at the end of August and will need to be renewed by the U.N. Security Council to continue. It was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after Israel\u2019s 1978 invasion, and its mission was expanded following the monthlong 2006 war between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah.",
      "The multinational force has played a significant role in monitoring the security situation in southern Lebanon for decades, including during the Israel-Hezbollah war last year, but has drawn criticism from both sides and numerous U.S. lawmakers, some of whom now hold prominent roles in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration or wield new influence with the White House.",
      "Trump administration political appointees came into office this year with the aim of shutting down UNIFIL as soon as possible. They regard the operation as an ineffectual waste of money that is merely delaying the goal of eliminating Hezbollah\u2019s influence and restoring full security control to the Lebanese Armed Forces that the government says it is not yet capable of doing.",
      "After securing major cuts in U.S. funding to the peacekeeping force, Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed off early last week on a plan that would wind down and end UNIFIL in the next six months, according to Trump administration officials and congressional aides familiar with the discussions.",
      "It\u2019s another step as the Trump administration drastically pares back its foreign affairs priorities and budget, including expressing skepticism of international alliances and cutting funding to U.N. agencies and missions. The transatlantic divide also has been apparent on issues ranging from Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza and the Russia-Ukraine conflict to trade, technology and free speech issues.",
      "Israel has for years sought an end to UNIFIL\u2019s mandate, and renewal votes have often come after weeks of political wrangling. Now, the stakes are particularly high after last year\u2019s war and more vigorous opposition in Washington.",
      "European nations, notably France and Italy, have objected to winding down UNIFIL. With the support of Tom Barrack, U.S. ambassador to Turkey and envoy to Lebanon, they successfully lobbied Rubio and others to support a one-year extension of the peacekeeping mandate followed by a time-certain wind-down period of six months, according to the administration officials and congressional aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic negotiations.",
      "Israel also reluctantly agreed to an extension, they said.",
      "The European argument was that prematurely ending UNIFIL before the Lebanese army is able to fully secure the border area would create a vacuum that Hezbollah could easily exploit.",
      "The French noted that when a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali was terminated before government troops were ready to deal with security threats, Islamic extremists moved in.",
      "With the U.S. easing off, the issue ahead of the U.N. vote expected at the end of August now appears to be resistance by France and others to setting a firm deadline for the operation to end after the one-year extension, according to the officials and congressional aides.",
      "French officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The final French draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, does not include a date for UNIFIL's withdrawal, which U.S. officials say is required for their support. Instead, it would extend the peacekeeping mission for one year and indicates the U.N. Security Council's \u201cintention to work on a withdrawal.\u201d",
      "But even if the mandate is renewed, the peacekeeping mission might be scaled down for financial reasons, with the U.N. system likely facing drastic budget cuts, said a U.N. official, who was not authorized to comment to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "One of the U.S. officials said an option being considered was reducing UNIFIL\u2019s numbers while boosting its technological means to monitor the situation on the ground.",

      "Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon have frequently accused the U.N. mission of collusion with Israel and sometimes attacked peacekeepers on patrol. Israel, meanwhile, has accused the peacekeepers of turning a blind eye to Hezbollah\u2019s military activities in southern Lebanon and lobbied for its mandate to end.",
      "Sarit Zehavi, a former Israeli military intelligence analyst and founder of the Israeli think tank Alma Research and Education Center, said UNIFIL has played a \u201cdamaging role with regard to the mission of disarming Hezbollah in south Lebanon.\u201d",
      "She pointed to the discovery of Hezbollah tunnels and weapons caches close to UNIFIL facilities during and after last year\u2019s Israel-Hezbollah war, when much of the militant group\u2019s senior leadership was killed and much of its arsenal destroyed. Hezbollah is now under increasing pressure to give up the rest of its weapons.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said UNIFIL continues to discover unauthorized weapons, including rocket launchers, mortar rounds and bomb fuses, this week, which it reported to the Lebanese army.",
      "Under the U.S.- and France-brokered ceasefire, Israel and Hezbollah were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, with the Lebanese army taking control in conjunction with UNIFIL. Israel has continued to occupy five strategic points on the Lebanese side and carry out near-daily airstrikes that it says aim to stop Hezbollah from regrouping.",

      "Retired Lebanese Army Gen. Khalil Helou said that if UNIFIL\u2019s mandate were to abruptly end, soldiers would need to be pulled away from the porous border with Syria, where smuggling is rife, or from other areas inside of Lebanon \u2014 \u201cand this could have consequences for the stability\u201d of the country.",
      "UNIFIL \u201cis maybe not fulfilling 100% what the Western powers or Israel desire. But for Lebanon, their presence is important,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Three states moved to deploy hundreds of members of their National Guard to the nation\u2019s capital as part of the Trump administration\u2019s effort to overhaul policing in Washington through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness.",
      "West Virginia said it was deploying 300 to 400 Guard troops, while South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio says it will send 150 in the coming days.",
      "The moves announced Saturday came as protesters pushed back on federal law enforcement and National Guard troops fanning out in the heavily Democratic city following President Donald Trump's executive order federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 District of Columbia National Guard members.",
      "By adding outside troops to join the existing Guard deployment and federal law enforcement officers, Trump is exercising even tighter control over the city. It\u2019s a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though city officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump\u2019s first term in office.",
      "So far, National Guard members have played a limited role in law enforcement in D.C. and it\u2019s unclear why additional troops are needed. They have been seen patrolling at landmarks like the National Mall and Union Station and assisting with crowd control.",
      "A protest against Trump\u2019s intervention drew scores to Dupont Circle on Saturday before a march to the White House, about 1.5 miles away. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said, \u201cNo fascist takeover of D.C.,\u201d and some in the crowd held signs saying, \u201cNo military occupation.\u201d",
      "Trump was at his Virginia golf club after Friday\u2019s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.",
      "Morgan Taylor, one of the organizers who coordinated Saturday's protest, said they were hoping to spark enough backlash to Trump\u2019s actions that the administration would be forced to pull back on its crime and immigration agenda.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hot, but I\u2019m glad to be here. It\u2019s good to see all these people out here,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that this is happening in this country at this time.\u201d",
      "Fueling the protests were concerns about Trump overreach and that he had used crime as a pretext to impose his will on Washington.",
      "John Finnigan, 55, was taking a bike ride when he ran into the protest in downtown Washington. The real estate construction manager who has lived in the capital for 27 years said Trump's moves were \u201cridiculous\u201d because crime is down.",
      "\u201cHopefully, some of the mayors and some of the residents will get out in front of it and try and make it harder for it to happen in other cities,\u201d Finnigan said.",

      "Instead, Trump was the one who stood down, dropping his demand for a ceasefire in favor of pursuing a full peace accord \u2014 a position that aligns with Putin's.",
      "After calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, Trump wrote as he flew home from Friday's meeting in Alaska that it had been \u201cdetermined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.\u201d",

      "The bankruptcy trustee, Fred Stevens, blamed Marshall's insolvency on incompetent business practices and borrowing from people at above-market rates. The trustee contended that by 2011, Marshall was using new investment money to pay off previous investors, the hallmark of a Ponzi scheme.",
      "Prosecutors claim Marshall falsely represented the profitability of his real estate business and had his staff generate \"transaction summaries\u201d with bogus information about account balances and earned interest.",

      "It has been 150 years since miners first flocked to South Dakota's Black Hills in a gold rush that displaced Native Americans",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- A gold rush brought settlers to South Dakota's Black Hills roughly 150 years ago, chasing the dream of wealth and displacing Native Americans in the process.",
      "Now, a new crop of miners driven by gold prices at more than $3,000 an ounce are seeking to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region.",
      "\u201cThese impacts can be long term and make it so that tourism and outdoor recreation is negatively impacted,\u201d said Lilias Jarding, executive director of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance. \u201cOur enjoyment of the Black Hills as a peaceful place, a sacred place, is disturbed.\u201d",
      "The Black Hills encompass over 1.2 million acres (485,622 hectares), rising up from the Great Plains in southwest South Dakota and extending into Wyoming. The jagged peaks are smaller than those of the Rocky Mountains, but the lush pine-covered hills are sacred to the Lakota Sioux people and serve as a destination for millions of tourists who visit Mount Rushmore and state parks.",
      "One gold mine now operates in the Black Hills, but companies have proposals before state and federal agencies for another one, plus exploratory drilling sites that they hope will lead to full-fledged mines. That has prompted opposition by Native American tribes and environmentalists who argue the projects are close to sacred sites, will contaminate waterways and permanently scar the landscape.",
      "Gold extraction has changed dramatically in the decades since prospectors first began panning for gold in the Black Hills. The industry now typically relies on massive trucks and diggers that create deep, multitiered pits and use chemicals like cyanide to extract the gold.",
      "The land can never return to its original state. The Homestake mine, once the largest and deepest gold mine in the Western Hemisphere, now sits barren in Lead, South Dakota, and is used for scientific research.",
      "Interest in Black Hills gold mining has soared along with the price of the metal. When the Homestake mine closed in 2002, gold sold for about $300 an ounce. Now it goes for about 10 times as much.",
      "Joseph Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, attributes the price spike to global economic uncertainty.",
      "\u201cGold tends to be a stable asset,\u201d he said. \u201cThat actually performs well in inflationary times, and holds its value in recessionary times. That\u2019s why gold as an asset in investment.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump also boosted the industry by issuing an executive order in March to increase American mineral production, calling for expedited permitting and reviews.",
      "Colin Paterson, professor emeritus of geological engineering at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, notes that Black Hills gold is encased in rock. To extract it, the rock is crushed and then a chemical like cyanide is used to dissolve the mineral and remove it.",
      "Coeur Mining runs the single active mine in the Black Hills, but the company Dakota Gold has plans for an open pit mine to begin operating in 2029. The company is also targeting the area near the old Homestake site to build an underground mine where workers would descend hundreds or even thousands of feet into shafts.",

Dakota Gold will conduct an environmental study and surveys of soil and vegetation to ensure safe operation, Henris said.",
      "\u201cMost of the people that work here are from this area and just love to live here,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re a big part of the Hills and we love them just as much as other folks.\u201d",
      "To a great extent, gold mining helped create the modern Black Hills region.",
      "The U.S. government signed a treaty in 1868 that recognized the Sioux Nation's right to the Black Hills, but the government seized the land after the discovery of gold and allowed settlers into the region. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled the Sioux were entitled to compensation, but they have not accepted any and maintain their claim to the land.",
      "Tribes have largely opposed mining in the Black Hills.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a central truth about mining in the Black Hills in that it was never the most mineral rich place there ever was,\u201d said Taylor Gunhammer, local organizer with the Indigenous advocacy group NDN Collective and an Oglala Sioux, one of the Lakota people. \u201cIt\u2019s not even the actual mineral content of the Black Hills that is so attractive to mining companies. It\u2019s the permissive nature of the officials who oversee mining.\u201d",
      "Some proposed projects, such as Dakota Gold\u2019s mine, are on private land and only subject to state rules, not the U.S. Forest Service regulations required for projects on public acreage.",
      "Environmentalists have focused their opposition on the possibility of chemicals leaks. They note that Coeur's Wharf mine has had nearly 200 spills and that the former Homestake mine was closed because it contaminated a nearby creek.",
      "Coeur\u2019s environmental manager, Jasmine McCauley, said in a statement that each spill was \"thoroughly investigated, mitigated, and corrective actions are put in place to prevent reoccurrence.\u201d The company is always improving its processes, she added.",
      "Jarding, of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance, said she remains concerned about the number of projects in the works.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that people understand the exponential growth in mining activity that\u2019s been happening in the Black Hills over the last five years or so,\u201d Jarding said. \"There are currently active mining claims on 271,000 acres in the Black Hills. That\u2019s 20% of the whole Black Hills that is potentially going to be subject to mining.\u201d",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Months before New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was set to leave office because of term limits, she has been indicted in what prosecutors allege was a yearslong scheme to conceal a romantic relationship with her bodyguard.",
      "Prosecutors say bodyguard Jeffrey Vappie was being paid as if he was working when he and Cantrell were really alone in apartments and visiting vineyards, hiding their communication by sending encrypted messages through WhatsApp and then deleting them. Although the pair have said their relationship was strictly professional, the indictment described it as \u201cpersonal and intimate.\u201d",
      "The first female mayor in New Orleans\u2019 300-year history has been charged with conspiracy, fraud and obstruction. Vappie was already facing charges of wire fraud and making false statements. He has pleaded not guilty. A grand jury returned an 18-count indictment Friday that added Cantrell to the case.",
      "The City of New Orleans said in a statement that it was aware of the indictment and that the mayor\u2019s attorney was reviewing it.",
      "Cantrell hasn\u2019t sent out a message on her official social media feed on X since July 15, when she said the city was experiencing historic declines in crime. She and her remaining allies have said that she has been unfairly targeted as a Black woman and held to a different standard than male officials.",
      "Here are things to know about the mayor and the indictment:",
      "The indictment paints a detailed picture of Cantrell and her bodyguard traveling to vineyards and spending time alone in apartments at the same time it says Vappie was being paid as if he was working.",
      "Vappie reminisced in a WhatsApp exchange cited in the indictment about joining Cantrell in Scotland in October 2021, saying that was \u201cwhere it all started.\u201d",
      "Cantrell had told local reporters she needed a security detail \u201cdue to COVID,\u201d saying her travel accommodations were \u201ca matter of safety, not of luxury.\u201d",
      "The following year, instead of Cantrell attending a conference in Miami, authorities said the pair rendezvoused on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Vappie\u2019s travel to the island was covered by the city to attend a separate conference.",

      "Ziva Mann has been navigating the challenges of raising a transgender child within an Orthodox Jewish community",
      "Ziva Mann remembers how joyful and smiley her daughter was as a child \u2014 the family even gave her the nickname \u201cGiggles.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe was just sunshine,\u201d Mann said. That changed around second grade, when her joy began to fade. \u201cShe got sadder and sadder,\u201d Mann recalled. \u201cIt was like watching someone disappear.\u201d",
      "Mann later realized that her child\u2019s growing sadness was connected to a struggle to reckon with her gender identity.",
      "Her daughter came out as transgender at home in Massachusetts four years ago. \u201cMom, I\u2019m a girl,\u201d Mann remembers hearing her say. Though she was surprised by the news, she quickly came to admire her daughter\u2019s bravery.",
      "Since then, the family has striven to find the best ways to support Ellie within their modern Orthodox community, where tradition and strict gender roles shape daily life. They\u2019ve managed to find emotional and spiritual resources close to home at a time when transgender rights are under attack nationwide.",
      "Two of the three biggest branches of Judaism in the U.S. \u2014 Reform and Conservative \u2014 support the rights of transgender people, but it can still be challenging for trans youth to find an inclusive congregation.",
      "Schools in Orthodox Jewish communities are typically divided by gender, and most synagogues have separate seating sections for men and women \u2014 sometimes on different floors.",
      "\u201cOrthodoxy today is just binary,\u201d said Myriam Kabakov, co-founder and executive director of Eshel, an organization supporting LGBTQ+ people in Orthodox environments. \u201cYou\u2019re either male or you\u2019re female. So if a trans person is in between transitioning, very often they will be asked not to come to synagogue.\u201d",
      "She said even after someone has fully transitioned, rabbis should allow them to sit where they feel comfortable. But that acceptance is not guaranteed.",
      "To connect parents and trans children with inclusive synagogues, Eshel developed a program called \u201cWelcoming Shuls,\u201d where people can confide in spiritual leaders who will treat them with respect.",
      "According to Kabakov, about 300 rabbis and 160 families with trans members have joined their listings. Deslie Paneth is among them. She lives on Long Island and has traveled far to find support for Ollie, her transgender son.",
      "\u201cOne night, I said to my husband \u2018I need help, I don\u2019t know how to navigate this,'\u201d Paneth said. \u201cWithout Eshel, I don\u2019t know how this would have turned out for any of us.\u201d",
      "Mann defines herself as modern Orthodox, meaning she strives to uphold Judaic law while embracing the values within her family.",
      "\u201cThe only time we break the rules is to save someone\u2019s life,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause a life is more important than all of the rules.\u201d",
      "Respecting her daughter\u2019s identity felt akin to saving her life, so Mann didn\u2019t feel the need to talk to God about it. She said who her daughter is as a person mattered more than the gender she thought she had.",
      "Mann has heard of families with trans children who were asked to leave their synagogue, but this didn\u2019t happened to her. Before discussing Ellie's identity with other relatives, Mann reached out to her rabbi. He assured her that her daughter would be treated with dignity and respect.",
      "\u201cHe offered us a blessing,\u201d Mann said. \u201cThe strength, the love and the grace to parent a child who\u2019s walking a difficult path.\u201d",
      "Mann feels lucky to have found support, both in religious spaces and among family members, which has helped Ellie be her joyful self again. Some Orthodox families have faced a tougher process.",

      "Paneth recalled her son, before starting his transition around 2017, was deeply religious and they enjoyed sitting together at synagogue.",
      "\u201cHe tells me still today that, especially around the holiday times, it hurts him that he can\u2019t sit next to me in temple,\u201d Paneth said. \u201cHe\u2019s probably my child that has the strongest commitment to Judaism from an emotional connection.\"",
      "A rabbi told Paneth that Ollie is welcome to come to services, but he would now be expected to sit among the men. This is part of the reason why Ollie has not returned to synagogue since his transition.",
      "Ollie believes that his relationship with religion splintered as a student in an all-girls Orthodox Jewish high school. As he started raising questions about gender equality, none of the answers sufficed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still convinced that if I wasn\u2019t trans, I would still be a religious Jew,\u201d the 27-year-old said.",
      "He initially told his parents he was a lesbian. But since attending a secular college, making LGBTQ+ friends and feeling trapped during the pandemic, he decided to speak with them again. \u201cIf I was going to survive this, I had to come out with my parents as trans and start medically transitioning.\u201d",
      "He had top surgery in 2022 and soon after met his girlfriend at JQY, a program for Jewish LGBTQ+ teens. The couple now lives together in New York.",
      "Ollie doesn\u2019t think of himself as Orthodox, and says he would like to find a new path toward God. Paneth understands and still includes him in the Jewish holidays. Ollie appreciates it.",
      "Because he first connected to God as a girl, it doesn\u2019t feel natural to him to embrace traditions that are typical for Jewish men, like wearing a kippah.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t do any of the tasks that men do religiously because I\u2019m the same person I always was,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though I look different, my relationship to God didn\u2019t change.\u201d",
      "Kabakov said many LGBTQ+ Jews eventually decide to leave Orthodoxy, but for those who wish to remain, Eshel and some spiritual leaders offer support.",
      "Rabbi Mike Moskowitz, who works at an LGBTQ+ synagogue in New York, thinks of his job as helping people understand how they can be their authentic selves and still feel accepted by their religion. \u201cIt\u2019s not that Judaism is the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cOrthodoxy, the people, are the problem.\u201d",
      "The counseling he provides for trans children and their parents is specific to each person, but in general, he offers fresh interpretations of the Hebrew Bible.",
      "\u201cThose who want to be transphobic say the Bible says you can\u2019t wear misgendered clothing,\u201d Moskowitz said. \u201cI think a response is that trans folks are not wearing misgendered clothing. They\u2019re wearing gender-affirming clothing.\u201d",
      "He, like Kabakov, believes there\u2019s a trend in Orthodoxy toward more inclusivity, but there\u2019s more work to do.",
      "\u201cDiscrimination is unholy,\u201d he said. \u201cUnity is coping through kindness and being able to replace the weight of oppression with the elevation of love.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Road safety activists and some states are pushing to depart from a longstanding rule that sets speed limits in the United States based largely on how fast drivers actually travel",
      "Rose Hammond pushed authorities for years to lower the 55 mph speed limit on a two-lane road that passes her assisted living community, a church, two schools and a busy park that hosts numerous youth sports leagues.",
      "\u201cWhat are you waiting for, somebody to get killed?\u201d the 85-year-old chided officials in northwest Ohio, complaining that nothing was being done about the motorcycles that race by almost daily.",
      "Amid growing public pressure, Sylvania Township asked county engineers in March to analyze whether Mitchaw Road's posted speed is too high. The surprising answer: Technically, it's 5 mph too low.",
      "The reason dates back to studies on rural roads from the 1930s and 1940s that still play an outsized role in the way speed limits are set across the U.S. \u2014 even in urban areas.",
      "Born from that research was a widely accepted concept known as the 85% rule, which suggests a road\u2019s posted speed should be tied to the 15th-fastest vehicle out of every 100 traveling it in free-flowing traffic, rounded to the nearest 5 mph increment.",
      "But after decades of closely following the rule, some states \u2014 with a nudge from the federal government \u2014 are seeking to modify if not replace it when setting guidelines for how local engineers should decide what speed limit to post.",
      "The concept assumes that a road's safest speed is the one most vehicles travel \u2014 neither too high nor too low. If drivers think the speed limit should be raised, they can simply step on the gas and \u201cvote with their feet,\u201d as an old brochure from the Institute of Transportation Engineers once put it.",
      "\u201cThe problem with this approach is it creates this feedback loop,\u201d said Jenny O'Connell, director of member programs for the National Association of City Transportation Officials. \u201cPeople speed, and then the speed limits will be ratcheted up to match that speed.\u201d",
      "The association developed an alternative to the 85% rule known as \u201cCity Limits,\u201d which aims to minimize the risk of injuries for all road users by setting the speed limit based on a formula that factors in a street's activity level and the likelihood of conflicts, such as collisions.",
      "The report points out the 85% rule is based on dated research and that \u201cthese historic roads are a far cry from the vibrant streets and arterials that typify city streets today.\u201d",
      "Amid a recent spike in road deaths across the country, the Federal Highway Administration sent a subtle but important message to states that the 85% rule isn't actually a rule at all and was carrying too much weight in determining local speed limits. In its first update since 2009 to a manual that establishes national guidelines for traffic signs, the agency clarified that communities should also consider such things as how the road is used, the risk to pedestrians, and the frequency of crashes.",
      "Leah Shahum, who directs the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit advocating for street safety, said she wishes the manual had gone further in downplaying the 85% rule but acknowledges the change has already impacted the way some states set speed limits. Others, however, are still clinging to the simplicity and familiarity of the longstanding approach, she said.",
      "\u201cThe 85th percentile should not be the Holy Grail or the Bible, and yet over and over again it is accepted as that,\u201d Shahum said.",
      "Under its \u201c20 is Plenty\u201d campaign, the Wisconsin capital of Madison has been changing signs across the city this summer, lowering the speed limit from 25 mph to 20 mph on local residential streets.",
      "When Seattle took a similar step in a pilot program seven years ago, not only did it see a noticeable decline in serious injury crashes but also a 7% drop in the 85th percentile speed, according to the Vision Zero Network.",
      "California embraces the 85% rule even more than most states as its basis for setting speed limits. But legislators have loosened the restrictions on local governments a bit in recent years, allowing them to depart from the guidelines if they can cite a proven safety need. Advocates for pedestrians and bicyclists say the change helps, but is not enough.",

      "\u201cWe still have a long way to go in California in terms of putting value on all road users,\u201d said Kendra Ramsey, executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition. \u201cThere\u2019s still a very heavy mindset that automobiles are the primary method of travel and they should be given priority and reverence.\u201d",
      "But Jay Beeber, executive director for policy at the National Motorists Association, an advocacy organization for drivers, said following the 85% rule is usually the safest way to minimize the variation in speed between drivers who abide by the posted limit and those who far exceed it.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't really matter what number you put on a sign,\u201d Beeber said. \u201cThe average driver drives the nature of the roadway. It would be patently unfair for a government to build a road to encourage people to drive 45 mph, put a 30 mph speed limit on it, and then ticket everyone for doing what they built the road to do.\u201d",
      "Fears about oil prices prompted Congress in the 1970s to set a 55 mph national maximum speed limit, which it later relaxed to 65 mph before repealing the law in 1995 and handing the authority to states. Since then, speed limits have kept climbing, with North Dakota this summer becoming the ninth state to allow drivers to go 80 mph on some stretches of highway. There's even a 40-mile segment in Texas between Austin and San Antonio where 85 mph is allowed.",
      "Although high-speed freeways outside major population centers aren't the focus of most efforts to ease the 85% rule, a 2019 study from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety \u2014 a research arm funded by auto insurers \u2014 illustrates the risks. Every 5 mph increase to a state's maximum speed limit increases the chance of fatalities by 8.5% on interstate highways and 2.8% on other roads, the study found.",
      "\u201cMaybe back when you were driving a Model T you had a real feel for how fast you were going, but in modern vehicles you don't have a sense of what 80 mph is. You're in a cocoon,\u201d said Chuck Farmer, the institute's vice president for research, who conducted the study.",
      "If elected officials in Sylvania Township, Ohio, got their way, Mitchaw Road's posted speed limit would be cut dramatically \u2014 from 55 mph to 40 mph or lower. The county's finding that the 85% rule actually calls for raising it to 60 mph surprised the town's leaders, but not the engineers who ran the study.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t make decisions based on data, it\u2019s very difficult to make good decisions,\u201d Lucas County Engineer Mike Pniewski said.",
      "For now, the speed limit will remain as it is. That's because Ohio law sets maximum speeds for 15 different types of roadways, regardless of what the 85% rule suggests.",
      "And Ohio's guidelines are evolving. The state now gives more consideration to roadway context and allows cities to reduce speed limits based on the lower standard of the 50th percentile speed when there's a large presence of pedestrians and bicyclists. Authorities there recently hired a consultant to consider additional modifications based on what other states are doing.",
      "\u201cStates have very slowly started to move away from the 85th percentile as being kind of the gold standard for decision-making,\u201d said Michelle May, who manages Ohio's highway safety program. \u201cPeople are traveling and living differently than they did 40 years ago, and we want to put safety more at the focus.\u201d",
      "It's unclear whether any of these changes will ultimately impact the posted speed on Mitchaw Road. After years of futile calls and emails to state, county and township officials, Hammond says she isn't holding her breath.",
      "\u201cI just get so discouraged,\u201d she said.",

      "A jury in Salt Lake County found Nicholas Rossi guilty of a 2008 rape after a three-day trial in which his accuser and her parents took the stand. The verdict came hours after Rossi, 38, declined to testify on his own behalf. He will be sentenced in the case on Oct. 20 and is set to stand trial in September for another rape charge in Utah County.",

      "\u201cWe are grateful to the survivor in this case for her willingness to come forward, years after this attack took place,\u201d Gill said in a statement Wednesday night. \u201cWe appreciate her patience as we worked to bring the defendant back to Salt Lake County so that this trial could take place and she could get justice. It took courage and bravery to take the stand and confront her attacker to hold him accountable.\u201d",
      "Utah authorities began searching for Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, when he was identified through a decade-old DNA rape kit in 2018. He was among thousands of rape suspects identified and later charged when the state made a push to clear its rape kit backlog.",
      "Months after he was charged in Utah County, an online obituary claimed Rossi had died on Feb. 29, 2020, of late-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But police in his home state of Rhode Island, along with his former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead.

He stressed that the U.N.-verified figures don\u2019t reflect the global scale and prevalence of these crimes.",
      "The report\u2019s blacklist names 63 government and non-government parties in a dozen countries suspected of committing or being responsible for rape and other forms of sexual violence in conflict, including Hamas militants, whose attack in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, sparked the war in Gaza.",
      "Over 70% of those listed have appeared on the report\u2019s blacklist annex for five years or more without creating steps to prevent the violence, the U.N. chief said.",

      "President Donald Trump is on his way to a meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin in Alaska",
      "JOINT BASE ELMENDORF-RICHARDSON, Alaska -- President Donald Trump is meeting face-to-face with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin on Friday for a pivotal Alaska summit that could reshape both the war in Ukraine and relations between Moscow and Washington.",
      "The sit-down gives Trump a chance to prove to the world that he is both a master dealmaker and a global peacemaker. He and his allies have cast him as a heavyweight negotiator who can find a way to bring the slaughter to a close \u2014 something he used to boast he could do quickly.",
      "For Putin, a summit with Trump offers a long-sought opportunity to try to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia\u2019s gains, block Kyiv\u2019s bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow\u2019s orbit. Despite having so much at stake, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders aren't invited.",
      "There are significant risks for Trump. By bringing Putin onto U.S. soil \u2014 America bought Alaska from Russia in 1867 for 2 cents per acre \u2014 the president is giving him the validation he desires after his ostracization following his invasion of Ukraine 3 1/2 years ago. Zelenskyy's exclusion from Trump and Putin's first meeting is a heavy blow to the West\u2019s policy of \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d and invites the possibility that Trump could agree to a deal that Ukraine does not want.",
      "Any success is far from assured because Russia and Ukraine remain far apart in their demands for peace. Putin has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine\u2019s mobilization efforts, which were conditions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies.",
      "\"HIGH STAKES!!!\" Trump posted shortly before he boarded Air Force One for Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage.",
      "On his way to the meeting, Putin stopped in Magadan, in Russia\u2019s Far East, where he visited a factory producing omega-3 fish oil capsules, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Putin was reviewing materials on Ukraine, tensions with the U.S., economic cooperation and global affairs during his four-hour flight to Alaska, where he will be greeted at his plane by Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state TV.",
      "Trump and Putin have shared closely watched handshakes before \u2014 but Friday's will be as scrutinized as any, as will any body language or hints about how each is feeling.",
      "Trump on Thursday said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but he also floated the idea that if the meeting succeeds he could bring Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting \u2014 a possibility that Russia hasn't agreed to.",
      "When asked after arriving in Alaska about Trump's estimate of a 25% chance of failure, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia \u201cnever plans ahead.\u201d",
      "\"We know that we have arguments, a clear, understandable position. We will state it,\u201d he said in footage posted to the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s Telegram channel.",
      "Trump said in a Fox News radio interview Thursday that he didn't know if they would get \u201can immediate ceasefire\u201d but he wanted a broad peace deal done quickly. That seemingly echoes Putin\u2019s longtime argument that Russia favors a comprehensive deal to end the fighting, reflecting its demands, not a temporary halt to hostilities.",
      "The Kremlin said Trump and Putin will first sit down for a one-on-one discussion, followed by the two delegations meeting and talks continuing over \u201ca working breakfast.\u201d They are then expected to hold a joint press conference.",
      "In the days leading up to the summit, Trump described it as \u201c really a feel-out meeting.\u201d But he's also warned of \u201cvery severe consequences\u201d for Russia if Putin doesn't agree to end the war and said that though Putin might bully other leaders, \u201cHe\u2019s not going to mess around with me.\u201d",
      "Trump said Friday that his talks with Putin will include Russian demands that Ukraine cede territory as part of a peace deal. He said Ukraine has to decide, but he also suggested Zelenskyy should accept concessions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got to let Ukraine make that decision. And I think they\u2019ll make a proper decision,\u201d Trump told reporters traveling with him to Alaska.",

      "\u201cOr, if has been the past track record, he continues to back down and look for ways to wiggle out of the kind of threats and pressure he has promised to apply,\u201d said Kendall-Taylor, who is a former senior intelligence officer.",

      "The news was like dropping \u201ca grenade in the laps\u201d of business owners, said Osbert Ordu\u00f1a, who owns a New York City dispensary called The Cannabis Place that is now deemed to be too close to a nearby preschool.",

      "Business owners found out about the issue from the Office of Cannabis Management last month, which admitted it should have been measuring from the edge of a school\u2019s property line, rather than its entrance, to ensure weed stores were kept at least 500 feet (152 meters) away.",
      "\u201cTo give you this news, and for the weight of it, I am incredibly sorry,\u201d said Felicia A.B. Reid, acting executive director of the cannabis agency, said in notices to the businesses.",

      "On top of that, there are almost 50 other businesses that have applied for licenses under the incorrect measurement system and are awaiting final approval from the agency. The state has set aside a pot of money where applicants can get up to $250,000 to help relocate.",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 10:46:08 -0400",
    "summary": "Whimsical and romantic, the music of Icelandic singer and cellist Laufey L\u00edn Bing J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir blends pop, jazz, classical and bossa nova \u2013 a \"mishmash,\" she calls it. Her latest album is \"A Matter of Time.\"",
    "story": [
      "Laufey's music may not be what you usually think of as \"pop,\" but if pop is short for popular, then she is indeed a pop star. The 26-year-old Icelander has earned a devoted following blending modern lyrics and music with classical and jazz. \"My music is such a combination of the sounds of my childhood,\" she said. \"It's just something that's become a part of me. I wanted to make things that made me happy.",
      "\"I loved Golden Age musicals,\" said Laufey. \"I'd watch 'Carousel' and 'Oklahoma' and 'American in Paris' and 'Sound of Music.' They were so beautiful and had these dance breaks and the dresses were floating and the colors \u2013 that feeling I got from that, I just wanted to create that feeling.\"",
      "The world she inhabits (in her work, anyway) is whimsical and romantic, full of windswept cliffs, frilly dresses and bows \u2026 and cello, almost always cello.",
      "Watch Laufey perform \"I Wish You Love\" with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra:",
      "She says the cello is \"as important to me as my voice. And I think it's really what makes a Laufey song a Laufey song.\"",
      "Laufey L\u00edn Bing J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir comes by it naturally. Her Icelandic father introduced her to jazz when she was a girl; her Chinese mother played classical violin. So does Laufey's identical twin sister.",
      "Growing up, she said, she felt different: \"Everyone was like, you know, going to play soccer after school or dance, and I was sitting down and playing music from the 17th century. And then on top that I was a twin, identical twin. I just feel, like, weird on top of weird, on top of weird.\"",
      "And things only got weirder when she started singing, as when she appeared on the TV competition \"Iceland's Got Talent\" singing Alicia Keys' \"If I Ain't Got You,\" at age 13: \"I remember going on singing competitions in Iceland when I was younger and they'd always be like, 'She sounds like a 40-year-old woman that's been divorced twice and she chain-smokes cigarettes,'' Laufey said. \"And I was, like, a 13-year-old girl standing on stage being like, okay, like, I just wanted to be a girl. So, yeah I was always a little bit like \u2026 felt a little bit like a circus act.\"",
      "But Laufey found her footing at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. She started posting original songs and jazz covers on social media during the pandemic, and they quickly went viral.",
      "Laufey performs \"I Love You (For Sentimental Reasons\") on guitar and cello:",
      "I asked, \"Were you surprised that people were responding to the jazz influences?\"",
      "\"I was so shocked, because I'd never seen any example of it before,\" Laufey replied. \"And I'd never seen a community of young people \u2026 that was the most shocking part, that it was young people responding to the music. But there was always a part of me that was like, of course, it's the best music in the world!\"",
      "Now she sells out just about every concert \u2013 like a recent one in Norfolk, Virginia, where one fan, Alissa, told us, \"When I first like showed, like, my parents that, they were like, 'This is what you guys listen to?' And I was like, 'Yeah, like, this is what, like, younger people are listening to!'\"",
      "Another fan, Logan, said, \"I feel like she takes just kind of more 'old people music' and pushes it into, like, a newer generation so that more people can enjoy it.\"",
      "Laufey's new album, \"A Matter of Time,\" comes out this week. A stadium tour will follow.",
      "Her songwriting usually starts on guitar, like her bossa nova-influenced \"From the Start.\"",
      "But she just as easily can weave in a little classical, as she did on her last album, \"Bewitched.\" Last year, \"Bewitched\" briefly knocked Frank Sinatra off the top of the jazz charts \u2013 and then, that album won a best traditional pop vocal Grammy Award, beating such artists as Bruce Springsteen.",
      "And then, Barbra Streisand asked Laufey to sing on her recent album of duets, performing a song Laufey wrote, \"Letter to My 13-Year-Old Self.\" \"It's one of those songs that I wrote just in my most intimate moments and could have been a song that I never put out,\" she said. \"It was a song for me to heal myself. But it's a very hopeful song. It's reaching back to tell your younger self that you're going to be okay.\"",
      "Don't you worry 'bout your curly hair Clothes that don't quite fit you anywhere Voices echo in the gym Another girl's had her first kiss Please don't think too much of it, darling",
      "I asked, \"What do you think your 13-year-old self would think of all of this?\"",
      "\"I think she'd be really excited,\" Laufey replied. \"I think she'd be really happy. There's not a single part of myself that has changed any of my artistic interests to follow some sort of trend. And I get to make exactly the music that I loved back then. So, I think I would've been really, really happy.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 10:45:48 -0400",
    "summary": "The former \"Parks and Recreation\" star heads the surreal, critically-acclaimed series about workers at a mysterious corporation whose brains are altered to create distinctly separate personalities in and out of the office.",
    "story": [
      "Adam Scott was once a solid \"that guy\" \u2013 a steadily working actor you might recognize from any number of roles. He's been active since the early nineties, playing everything from Howard Hughes' press agent in \"The Aviator,\" to a pompous jerk in \"Step Brothers.\" He's acted in large ensemble television shows like \"Party Down\" and \"Parks and Recreation.\" But in 2022, when ads started popping up for a new Apple TV+ show called \"Severance,\" with his face front and center, it was a new experience for Scott.",
      "\"It was terrifying, like, truly,\" he said. \"As an actor, it's something you wait your entire career for, your entire life for. But when it happened, I was immediately terrified, and didn't quite know why. I guess I was afraid that it was just gonna end up being embarrassing, and people were gonna make fun of us, and make fun of me.\"",
      "Quite the opposite. \"Severance\" ended up becoming a critically acclaimed hit. The show's second season is nominated for more Emmys than any other show this year (27 in all), including outstanding drama series, and a lead actor nomination for Scott.",
      "Scott's character, Mark, works for a mysterious, seemingly sinister corporation. When he's off the clock, he has no memory of his work life. He is a \"severed\" employee \u2013 a device in his brain separates his office self from his home self.",
      "In this scene, Mark S. (Adam Scott) meets his non-office self, Mark Scout, through video recordings:",
      "I said, \"A lot of people relate to 'Severance' because of that sentiment of like, 'Wouldn't it be nice to turn your brain off from 9:00 to 5:00 and not do my mind-numbing job?'\u00a0 It sounds like you never really had a job like that, though. How do you tap into that?\"",
      "\"It's funny, because the things that ended up really sort of making a difference in my career were, like, 'Parks and Rec' and 'Party Down' and 'Severance,'\" said Scott. \"They are largely shows that are about work. And these are jobs that I've never actually had to participate in in real life, 'cause I was always in a play or doing a guest spot on 'NYPD Blue' or whatever. I guess I relate to these kind of feelings that these characters have because it's been sort of this long path for me in show business.\"",
      "Scott's path began in his hometown of Santa Cruz, California, where he'd spend hours in his room watching, and imitating, actors he saw on David Letterman.",
      "Did the idea of doing it professionally cross his mind? \"100%,\" said Scott. \"In fact, I used to practice on my bed. I would set it up like a couch. I would practice being on David Letterman. I remember I had a project that I would pretend I was promoting, where Harrison Ford and I were playing father-and-son cops. I'm sure I just looked like an insane person.\"",
      "\"For what it's worth I would watch that today,\" I said.",
      "\"I know, it sounds great!\"",
      "After some success in high school plays, Scott moved to Pasadena to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he started thinking that \"Adam Scott\" didn't sound dramatic enough: \"When I was in theater school, I really fancied myself as a very serious actor in the vein of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. In fact, at one point I wanted to change my last name to Quardero. I remember writing on a piece of paper, 'Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Adam Quardero.' My mother's maiden name was Quartararo.\"",
      "Scott stuck with his last name and, after graduation, stuck it out through the high and lows of building an acting career. \"One thing I always felt that I knew about myself is that I was never going to leave,\" he said. \"I didn't have any other options. But I knew that I was just gonna stick around until something happened, something came together for me.\"",
      "Scott's five seasons on the NBC sitcom \"Parks and Recreation\" took his career to the next level, although it came with an unexpected downside: now that he was so well known for comedy, it was harder to get dramatic roles.",
      "Ben Stiller, one of the executive producers and the primary director of \"Severance,\" said of Scott, \"He'd done, you know, work that was dramatic before, it just wasn't things that, you know, people really hadn't seen as much of it as his comedy work.",
      "He believed Scott had the skills necessary to play what's essentially two roles \u2013 or at least, two parts of the same person \u2013 sometimes transitioning between his severed personalities in a single shot. \"The key to the effect working really is Adam's change of expression, and just how good he is as an actor technically,\" Stiller said. \"He has to get that timing right of the change with the camera effect, so it's not easy to do. He can take a note just, you know, adjust something, you know, minimally, that very few actors I work with can do as well as him.\"",
      "I asked Stiller, \"It seems like you saw that potential early on. Was it a tough sell for the studio to have him front the show?\"",
      "\"You know, they had a different idea in the beginning, but I said, 'Look, Adam, to me, I think he's the guy,\" Stiller replied.",
      "It's clear fans agree. As part of Apple's massive marketing push for \"Severance,\" viewers were invited to an event at the historic former Bell Labs building in Holmdel, New Jersey, which stands in for the headquarters of the show's fictional Lumon Industries.",
      "Scott said, \"Seeing the photos of this place, of the Bell Labs building, it started dawning on me just the scale of the show and what it was exactly that Ben had in mind.\"",
      "Outside of \"Severance,\" Scott's work life and home life revolve around his wife, Naomi. They produce podcasts, films, and TV shows together. They met in the late '90s, which means she's seen him through a number of career ups and downs. \"I kind of learned that there was a cycle of him, you know, picking himself up off the ground, and I did know how to nurture and encourage that,\" Naomi said. \"That, I knew how to do. But it was hard to watch.\"",
      "I asked, \"What's it been like to see people finally see what you've been seeing for all these years?\"",
      "\"Oh, it's very vindicating!\" she laughed. \"I knew it. It's great. I love it.\"",
      "Adam Scott had to audition for \"Severance,\" and fight for the role. Now, with season three already in the works, the actor who always knew he was in it for the long haul is finally getting his due. Though he recognizes that there is no \"Bank of Hollywood\" that is allowing him to cash in after making 30 years of deposits.\u00a0 \"No \u2013 you're entitled to nothing in show business, and I knew that,\" he said. \"But I also knew that there was something I could bring to it that nobody else could. And I knew that I would have to give all of myself to it in order to pull it off. I would have to use absolutely everything I've learned over 30 years if I was gonna do it right. And so, when I was lucky enough to get the job, that's exactly what I did.\"",

      "Taylor Swift's upcoming album release and her love of all things orange isn't lost on her fans \u2014 or brands that are seeking a ride on what has become an enormous economic tailwind.",
      "On Wednesday after Swift went on the \"New Heights\" podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend, NFL football star Travis Kelce, to announce the imminent release of her 12th studio album \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" major companies went into marketing overdrive.",
      "Numerous corporations, from United Airlines to Olive Garden, began posting orange-hued memes on their own social media accounts soon after the new album was announced. Shake Shack, FedEx, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cinnabon, Walmart and Netflix did, too.",
      "That's because Swift appeared onstage wearing orange numerous times toward the end of her Eras Tour, and discussed her feelings about the color on the Wednesday podcast.",
      "\"It feels like energetically how my life has felt,\" the 14-time Grammy winner tells co-host Jason Kelce.",
      "Many, it seemed, saw value in tying their brand to Swift.",

      "Swift's tour appearances have become economic events. The singer's Eras Tour two years ago was the first such tour to cross the billion-dollar mark, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end charts. Cities and their surrounding areas registered a sizeable economic boost after Swift appeared, with thousands of fans making the pilgrimage and spending money at hotels, restaurants and elsewhere.",
      "Swift also mentioned during the Wednesday podcast that she had Lasik eye surgery. In response, the X account for LASIK.com wasted no time promoting the fortuitous namedrop. The post had more than 450,000 views and 17,000 likes as of Friday.",
      "About 500,000 Americans undergo Lasik every year, CBS News recently reported. And while the American Refractive Surgery Council says the complication rate is less than 1%, side effects are not uncommon and should not be taken lightly by those considering the procedure.",

The most-watched podcast episode ever on YouTube, and likely the most-consumed podcast ever, is by a company called Thmanyah, a Saudi Arabian Arabic podcast network and independent journalism platform, according to its website. The video has racked up 144 million views in two years.",

      "\"This is the record I've been wanting to make for a very long time,\" Swift said.",

      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" release date",
      "The album will be released on Friday, Oct. 3. Fans of Swift know the dates she chooses to announce and release music almost always have meaning and often have a 13, her lucky number, somewhere.",
      "\"Never not annoying,\" she said about herself on the podcast. \"Always going to try to force a 13 into the situation and this one was right there.\"",
      "Swift, Max Martin and Shellback produced the album",
      "Swift made \"The Life of a Showgirl\" with Max Martin and Shellback, producers she has worked with in the past but never for the entirety of an album.",
      "\"The three of us have made some of my favorite songs that I've ever done before,\" Swift said. Those songs include \"22,\" \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" \"Blank Space,\" \"Style,\" \"Shake It Off,\" \"\u2026Ready For It?\" and \"Delicate.\"",
      "The three hadn't produced music together in seven or eight years, but returning to work with them \"felt like catching lightning in a bottle,\" Swift said.",
      "\"By the time we came back together, I feel like we had so much more dexterity to what we do,\" she said. \"This was the time where it felt like all three of us in the room were carrying the same weight as creators and it was really special.\"",
      "Martin and Shellback have also worked with pop artists like Britney Spears, Ariana Grande, P!nk and more.",
      "\"The best ideas we've ever had\"",
      "Swift said she approached Martin, who she described as her mentor, about doing an album at her Eras Tour show in Stockholm in May 2024.",
      "\"I essentially said to him, 'I want to be as proud of an album as I am of the Eras Tour and for the same reasons,' and he was like, 'Do you understand what kind of pressure that is?'\" Swift said.",
      "But Swift is confident in the outcome.",
      "\"We knew that we had to bring the best ideas we've ever had, and I also know the pressure I'm putting on this record by saying that, but I don't care because I love it that much, and I'm so proud of it, and it just comes from like the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life, and so that effervescence has come through on this record,\" she said.",
      "\"The Life of a Showgirl\" theme",
      "Swift described the theme of \"The Life of a Showgirl\" as \"everything that was going on behind the curtain\" during the Eras Tour.",
      "Asked by Jason Kelce why she chose orange for the color scheme of the album, Swift said, \"I've just always liked it, Jason.\"",
      "\"It feels like kind of energetically how my life has felt, and this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,\" she said.",

      "Swift shared the titles of the 12 tracks on the album: \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" \"Elizabeth Taylor,\" \"Opalite,\" \"Father Figure,\" \"Eldest Daughter,\" \"Ruin The Friendship,\" \"Actually Romantic,\" \"Wi$h Li$t,\" \"Wood,\" \"Cancelled!,\" \"Honey\" and \"The Life of a Showgirl (Feat. Sabrina Carpenter).\"",
      "The pop star added that there are no additional songs, a departure from past albums. Her most recent release, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" had 31 songs.",
      "\"Every single song is on this album for hundreds of reasons. \u2026 It's just right,\" she said. \"That focus and that kind of discipline with creating an album and keeping the bar really high is something I've been wanting to do for a very long time.",
      "\"I tend to love to write lots and lots of music, so it's a temptation to release lots of music. I wanted to do an album that was so focused on quality and on the theme and everything fitting together like a perfect puzzle.\"",
      "Melodies and lyrics were key goals",
      "Swift opened up about the primary objectives she had making \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"",
      "\"My main goals were melodies that were so infectious that you're almost angry at it and lyrics that are just as vivid but crisp and focused and completely intentional,\" she said.",
      "Martin had made a point to tell Swift he didn't want her to leave behind the type of writing and storytelling she did on \"folklore\" (released in July 2020) even if the sound of this album was different. Swift said she replied, \"I couldn't if I tried.\"",
      "\"So it was really amazing that we were able to, without doing too much overthinking, we were able to get in there and it was just ideas flying and all of these ideas were like, we've been waiting years to come back together and make this project.\"",
      "The album art",
      "The cover of \"The Life of a Showgirl\" is a layered picture of Swift submerged in water.",

      "Swift wanted the cover to show something offstage to represent the theme of the album.",
      "\"This album isn't really about what happened to me on stage, it's about what I was going through offstage,\" she said. \"It's the life beyond the show.\"",
      "The images were captured by photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, who Swift previously worked with for the album art for her sixth studio album, \"reputation,\" released in 2017.",
      "\"I loved what they did with those photos, so I called them up for this one, and I'm so happy with the way that the photos came out for this one,\" she said.",
      "The album was recorded in Sweden during the Eras Tour",
      "Swift traveled to Sweden on her off days while touring Europe during the Eras Tour to work on the album.",
      "\"I would be playing shows, I'd do like three shows in a row. I'd have like three days off, I'd fly to Sweden,\" she said. \"I was physically exhausted at this point in the tour but I was so mentally stimulated and so excited to be creating.\"",
      "\"This album is going to make you dance\"",
      "Some additional details about \"The Life of a Showgirl\" came from Travis Kelce, who revealed he has heard the whole album.",
      "\"I know they're all 12 bangers,\" he said. \"It's a lot more upbeat, and it's a lot more like fun pop like excitement. \u2026 I think it's a complete 180 from a lot of the songs on 'Tortured Poets' for sure.\"",

      "Taylor Swift appeared on the popular \"New Heights\" podcast alongside her boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and opened up about their relationship, buying back the master recordings of her first six albums, Easter eggs and her upcoming album, \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"",
      "Swift appeared on the prerecorded podcast released Wednesday, which is hosted by Travis Kelce and his brother, former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce. The episode marks the couple's first comprehensive media appearance.",
      "\"This podcast did a lot for me,\" Swift said. \"It gave me a boyfriend!\"",
      "Kelce attended Swift's Eras Tour stop at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, in 2023. At the time, Kelce shared on the podcast, he tried to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number; however, she never received it.",
      "Swift said Wednesday that the gesture made her feel \"like I was in an '80s John Hughes movie, and he was just like, standing outside of my window with a boom box being like, 'I want to date you.'\"",
      "Swift also spoke about buying back the master recordings from her first six studio albums. Swift described how she had wanted to own all her music after signing a record deal at age 15. She revealed that she sent her mother and brother to Los Angeles to talk with private equity company Shamrock Capital, which owned the masters at the time, about buying them.",
      "\"A couple months after the Super Bowl in Kansas City, I get a call from my mom,\" Swift said. \"She's like, 'You got your music.' I very dramatically hit the floor for real. Bawling my eyes out, weeping, like 'Really!?' I said to myself, 'Go tell Travis in a normal way,' he was playing video games, and he put his headset down. I was like, 'I got my music back!' And I was heaving crying. This changed my life.\"",
      "\"I just started crying, too,\" Kelce said. \"I was just so happy for you.\"",
      "Swift announced her 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" on 12:12 a.m. Tuesday, after putting out the word on her website. She revealed the cover art on Wednesday and that the album will be released on Oct. 3.",
      "Since Swift began releasing music at the age of 15, she has snuck hidden messages, or Easter eggs, into her work, social media posts and videos that fans try and decipher online. Swift said Wednesday that she is \"never going to plant an Easter egg that ties back to my personal life.\"",
      "\"I have parameters. There's do's and dont's,\" Swift said. \"It points to my music... It's something you don't know why I'm saying for a specific reason, but then you'll look back and go, 'Oh my God.'\"",
      "Swift revealed a recent Easter egg on the podcast about the descending orange door that appeared as a visual on the Eras Tour after the finale song, \"Karma.\"",
      "\"I would leave the stage every night going down the elevator, lift,\" Swift said. \"That's how every single Eras show ended \u2014 except for the last one, where I exited through a door, an orange door, to be specific. And that actually was an Easter egg. Basically the reason why I chose to exit that way is because I kind of wanted to give a little subliminal hint to the fans that I may be leaving the Eras Tour era, but I was also entering a new era.\"",
      "Swift said her upcoming album \"was something that I was working on while I was in Europe on the Eras Tour.\"",
      "\"Literally living the life of a showgirl!\" Travis Kelce added.",

      "Swift's last rerecording, \"1989 (Taylor's Version),\" arrived in October 2023, just four months after the release of \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version).\" That was the same year Swift claimed the record for the woman with the most No. 1 albums in history.",

      "Fewer young adults are achieving economic and family milestones typically associated with adulthood, according to a recent working\u00a0paper\u00a0from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "The paper looked at nationally representative data from 2005 and 2023 to examine changes in young adults' experiences reaching major life events, such as moving out of their parents' house, getting married, and having a child. Researchers found a dramatic shift in the attainment of these milestones in recent decades.",
      "The reason for this, according to the paper, is that more young adults between the ages of 25 and 34 are facing economic barriers compared with previous generations. Changing societal attitudes around family formation are also contributing to the sharp decline in the share of young people reaching what the U.S. Census Bureau considers to be \"key milestones.\"",
      "According to the working paper, \"Changes in Milestones of Adulthood,\" almost half of all young adults in 1975 had reached four milestones associated with adulthood: moving out of one's parents' home, getting a job, getting married and having a child.",
      "Five decades on, that progression has changed dramatically. The share of young adults that have followed the traditional pathway to adulthood has dropped to less than a quarter, according to the paper.",
      "\"...Living arrangements, economic opportunities and attitudes toward family formation have not been experienced in the same fashion across generations of young adults,\" the working paper reads. \"Increases in job turbulence and economic downturns, for example, have resulted in some young adults navigating more volatile and uncertain economic environments.\"",
      "Economic conditions, combined with changing cultural norms, \"have implications for how young people develop their identity as adults,\" the paper states.",
      "This redefinition of young adulthood comes as the cost of everyday essentials, including housing, food, gas and daycare rises. As a result, more Americans are choosing to forego having a family, in some cases because they deem such choices unaffordable, the study finds.",
      "Researchers measured changes in the achievement of individual milestones, too. While one-quarter of young adults achieved all four milestones, 28% met two economic milestones \u2014 moving out of their parents' homes and finding jobs.",
      "Women in the workforce",
      "In the 1970s, getting married, having a child, and living independently, were the second-most common group of milestones young people achieved, next to the completion of all four.",
      "Women's gains in the workforce, along with changing cultural attitudes, however, have led this combination of milestones to become less popular, the report notes.",
      "The completion of education, another marker of adulthood, has overshadowed other milestones over the years as an increasing number of young adults enroll in college, according to the paper.",
      "\"These higher levels of educational attainment result in contemporary cohorts spending a longer portion of their young adult lives enrolled in higher education, potentially delaying other markers of adulthood such as entering the labor force or marriage,\" the working paper states.",
      "When it comes to perceptions of adulthood, having a job takes precedence over marriage, as young adults see economic achievements as more directly tied to adulthood than they do committing to a spouse.",
      "\"Marriage is increasingly viewed as a capstone of adulthood, something to pursue after achieving economic stability through completing formal education, establishing an independent household and becoming employed,\" the working paper states.",

    "summary": "A new report from Deloitte shows the average cost for a packed lunch is now $6.15, up nearly 3% from 2024. But that all depends on what you buy.",
    "story": [
      "Depending on the items you choose, your child's lunch sandwich could cost more this school year than it did in 2024.",
      "That's according to a new report from Deloitte that shows the overall cost of homemade lunches is on the rise. The average cost for a packed lunch is now $6.15, according to Deloitte, up nearly 3% from $5.99 last year. Just under half of the parents polled by the survey said they expect their child's lunch to cost more this September than it did in 2024.",
      "The reason for the price increase, as the Deloitte report points out, is because the cost of groceries has climbed in recent years. Parents are now paying more for staples like whole milk, which is up 7.8% from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data for July, as well as for bananas, which are up 7.2%.",
      "The Consumer Price Index report for July, released earlier this week by the BLS, shows\u00a0that overall grocery prices are up 2.2% compared with last year.",
      "Some foods are cheaper",
      "Not all food prices have gone up; in fact, some food items are cheaper this year. In terms of specific lunch items, CBS' price tracker shows that the cost of white bread is actually 6% lower than it was in 2024.",
      "While the cost of American cheese is up 0.7% from July 2024, according to BLS data, it is down 2.6% from last month.",
      "Iceberg lettuce is 3.9% lower in cost than it was a year ago, according to July CPI data, while the price of romaine lettuce is 4.6% higher.",
      "Tomato prices are also down. The fruit commonly consumed as a vegetable cost 7.8% less per pound in July than it did a year ago.",
      "The overall higher sticker prices at supermarkets has been a major pressure point for Americans, half of whom say the cost of groceries is a\u00a0\"major\" source of stress\u00a0in their life right now, according to a poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "In response to their anticipation of higher lunch prices, caregivers plan to switch from name brands to store brands, choose cheaper sandwich options, and cut down in other household expenses to free up more cash for groceries, according to Deloitte's survey, which polled 1,203 caregivers of school-aged children.",
      "Frugal food shopping in the U.S. has \"generally been on an upward trend since October 2024,\" the report found, though it is still lower today than its peak in 2023.",
      "Cafeteria lunch crunch",
      "It's not just brown bag lunches that could end up costing families more. Cafeteria lunches, which tend to be cheaper than brown bag lunches, could also see a price hike this year.",
      "According to Tuesday's CPI data, the price of food at elementary and secondary schools is up 3.3% since July of last year. To account for inflation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month that it would funnel more money into the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs \u2014 which provide healthy, low-cost or free meals to children.",
      "To be sure, not everyone will end up paying full price for cafeteria school lunches. In Deloitte's survey, more than half of respondents said their school offers free lunch, regardless of income.",
      "School meal prices range from $2.95 for elementary school to $3.20 for high school a\u00a0survey\u00a0conducted by School Nutrition Association found.",

    "summary": "As Social Security celebrates its 90th anniversary, concerns are growing over its funding and recent staffing cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security celebrated its 90th anniversary Thursday, marking a major milestone for the program that supplies monthly benefit checks to almost 70 million senior citizens, disabled people and surviving family members of deceased workers.",
      "When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law on Aug. 14, 1935, he guaranteed for the first time that workers could rely on continuing income in retirement after they turned 65. As it enters its 10th decade, the program is only growing in importance amid an aging population, with a record number of Americans now collecting benefits.",
      "In the next 10 years, Social Security is expected to swell by an additional 12 million recipients, according to the AARP. But even as it grows in importance, the program is also facing mounting problems and growing questions over its long term viability.",
      "While many policy experts believe the program should be expanded, its outgoings now far outpace its income. Some Democratic lawmakers are also questioning the agency's ability to serve retirees after the Trump administration earlier this year made cuts to its workforce in what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities referred to\u00a0as the \"largest staffing cut in SSA's history.\"",
      "As these challenges have mounted, faith in the program has deteriorated, even as three-quarters of Americans say they believe Social Security is \"one of the most important programs\" the government offers, according to a recent AARP survey. Confidence in the future of Social Security has declined by 7% in the last five years, from 43% in 2020 to 36% in 2025, it found.",
      "Asked about these concerns, the Social Security Administration pointed to a Fox News interview Thursday with its commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said he's optimistic about the program's future and that the agency is working on improving its operations.",
      "The White House also took issue with the criticisms, with spokeswoman Liz Huston telling CBS News that the administration is improving customer service and \"preventing illegal aliens from accessing benefits. \"President Trump has made Social Security great again,\" she said.",
      "Funding woes",
      "A major headwind facing Social Security may not be new, but it is fast approaching: The possible insolvency of its trust funds as the gap between its revenue and expenditure grows.",
      "For instance, in 2024, the program cost $1.49 trillion, but total income was $1.42 trillion, according to the 2025 Social Security Board of Trustees' report.",
      "Because of that trend \u2014 which is expected to continue given the aging population \u2014 the Social Security trust funds are forecast to be\u00a0depleted by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, according to the most recent trustees' report. This so-called \"go-broke\" date has been a major source of stress for Americans who worry that there won't be enough money left by the time they reach retirement age.",
      "While some workers believe that the trust funds' insolvency means Social Security will cease making payments after that date, that is incorrect. Because the program is funded through payroll taxes, Social Security has a constant stream of income \u2014 although without the trust funds' financial cushion, the program will face a shortfall, leading to a cut in benefits.",
      "Without a fix, monthly benefits could be cut by as much as 23%, the Social Security Board of Trustees warned in its 2025\u00a0annual report.",
      "But there are options for shoring up the trust funds. For one, there's a current cap on the amount of income subject to Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100 in 2025, meaning any earnings above that amount are exempt from the payroll tax.",
      "One remedy would be to lift the cap on payroll taxes, an option that some Democratic lawmakers prefer. Another idea, floated by some Republican lawmakers, is to raise the retirement age, which currently stands at 67 for people born after 1960.",
      "Changes under President Trump",
      "President Trump has vowed not to cut Social Security, noting in a \"Meet the Press\" interview in December that \"we're not touching Social Security, other than we might make it more efficient.\" Nonetheless, concerns have mounted over the Trump administration's changes to the program, including cuts to its staff and the closure of some field offices.",
      "During a press call Wednesday organized by advocacy groups, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, claimed Mr. Trump and others in his administration are \"working overtime to try to dismantle Social Security.\"",
      "Many Americans also say they're worried about what sort of changes the new administration could make. According to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0from NerdWallet, 61% of Americans believe Social Security benefits will be cut under the current administration.",
      "The White House, however, contends that Social Security has become more efficient under Mr. Trump's leadership. In a statement released Thursday, the White House claimed that the agency is handling 70% more calls than last year and that it has cut down on wait times with the help of technology. It also said the average wait times for customers at field offices have declined by 23%.",
      "\"We have taken steps to reduce wait times, enhance security, and make it easier to navigate our programs,\" SSA commissioner Frank Bisignano wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News on Thursday. \"All the while ensuring we pay benefits accurately to those who are eligible to receive them.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday repeated his\u00a0promises to protect the program.",
      "The program will become \"stronger, bigger and better\" and is \"gonna be around a long time\" with Republicans in charge, he added in remarks from the White House.",

    "story": [
      "As recently as 2021, almost half of all U.S. mansions \u2014 homes with at least 5,000 square feet of livable space \u2014 cost $1 million or less. But today, only a handful of cities still offer top-end homes at that price range, according to a new Zillow\u00a0analysis of home prices across the U.S.",
      "Nationwide, mansions are selling for a median price of $1.4 million, but in some parts of the country, high-end properties fetch far more. In four major California cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, the median mansion has a price tag of $4.5 million, Zillow said.",
      "In four metro areas, though, homebuyers can snap up an extra-large residence for under $1 million:",

      "For those willing to trade location for space, mansion values also hover around or slightly more than $1 million across the Midwest and in some Southern cities as well, including Louisville, Kentucky and Birmingham, Alabama, according to Zillow.",
      "\"In general, mansion prices move with general affordability. So in places like Buffalo, Indianapolis, Cleveland and Memphis, in the broad scheme of the U.S., these markets tend to be relatively more affordable,\" Zillow senior economist Kara Ng told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So it makes sense you could find a typical mansion for under $1 million in those regions.\"",
      "Many mansions that below the $1 million mark are less expensive because they are older homes, with a median construction year of 1985 versus 2000 for the median construction year for all mansions, Zillow said.",
      "In 2021, nearly half of all U.S. mansions were worth less than $1 million. Today, just three in 10 fall below the $1 million threshold, according to the report.",
      "Mansions \u2014 and homes in general \u2014 are most costly on the coasts. In San Jose, the median mansion is valued at $6.5 million, for example. \"The coasts tend to be on the pricier side, and that follows general affordability trends,\" Ng said. \"It's hard to build due to geographical constraints, and housing deficits in these areas tends to put upward pressure on prices.\"",
      "To be sure, homebuyers in every price range are getting less for their money, with the median U.S. home sale price reaching\u00a0a record of nearly $400,000 in June, according to Redfin. Tight inventory and high mortgage rates has made it tougher for would-be buyers to enter the property market.",
      "Last year, just 24% of home sales were to first-time homebuyers, down from 50% in 2010, according to data from the National Association of Realtors.",
      "Where are the most mansions under $1 million?",
      "Atlanta, Georgia has the greatest number of mansions \u2014 21,634 \u2014 under $1 million. That accounts for 5% of all mansions under $1 million in the U.S. Look to New York City for the second highest share of large residences \u2014 2,555, \u2014 under $1 million.",

    "story": [
      "The producer price index, or PPI, surged last month, far outpacing economists' forecasts and suggesting that President Trump's tariffs are starting to significantly drive up the cost of imported goods.",
      "Wholesale inflation rose 0.9% in July from the prior month, the Labor Department said Thursday, outstripping economists' expectations for a 0.2% increase. The jump marks the largest in more than three years, since June 2022.",
      "The PPI, which measures price changes before they reach consumers, suggests cost hikes are on the way for shoppers, economists said.",
      "So far in 2025, consumer prices\u00a0have been slow to rise despite economists' warnings that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariff agenda would hike costs for both U.S. businesses and consumers. That's partly because some importers took steps to offset the impact by preordering inventory and absorbing some tariffs to shield consumers in the short term.",
      "But because those were stop-gap measures, economists have warned consumers are unlikely to be insulated from tariff-driven inflation indefinitely. The latest PPI data underscores that higher prices are rippling through the economy, experts say.",
      "\"Tariff-exposed goods are rising at a rapid clip, indicating that the willingness and ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be waning,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note Thursday, noting that the wholesale price increases were broad-based.",
      "\"We anticipate broader signs of tariff-driven inflation in the data over time as inventories roll over and firms adjust pricing under margin pressure,\" they said.",
      "The PPI report comes two days after July's Consumer Price Index was slightly cooler than economists had expected, rising 2.7% on an annual basis. The CPI measures changes in prices for goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "The PPI report \"indicates that the new tariffs are continuing to generate cost pressures in the supply chain, which consumers will shoulder soon,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs said in a research note Thursday.",

      "The data complicates the decision the Federal Reserve faces at its Sept. 17 meeting about whether to hold or cut its benchmark interest rate, according to economists.",
      "The central bank has held the rate steady since December 2024, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noting that the economy remains relatively solid and that it wants to take a \"wait and see\" approach to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "The Fed is tasked with keeping inflation low while also promoting full employment \u2014 a two-pronged goal known as its dual mandate.",
      "Because the CPI report came in cooler than expected, the Fed had been seen as more likely to cut rates next month. But the latest PPI data may put that in doubt, given a rate cut would make it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow, thereby potentially further stoking inflation.",
      "\"After a string of data pointing to greater odds of a September rate cut, the large upside surprise in producer prices highlights the dilemma the Federal Reserve faces in judging the risks to its dual mandate,\" Matthew Martin, of Oxford Economics wrote. The group expects the Fed to hold off on rate cuts until December.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 11:32:30 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans are reining in their spending at fast-food restaurants as they continue to face economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "The most important meal of the day is also shaping up to be the most skipped meal of the day, at least according to two of the country's largest fast-food chains.",
      "McDonald's and Wendy's last week, during their respective earnings calls, said they're seeing sluggish breakfast sales. The companies attributed the trend to heightened economic uncertainty and pressures facing low-income consumers.",
      "\"There is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer,\" McDonald's CEO Christopher Kempczinski said on the company's earnings call on Aug. 6.",
      "Despite wage gains, real incomes are down for low-income consumers, who are facing a lot of financial stress, the CEO said, citing President Trump's tariffs as a potential contributor.",
      "\"So real incomes are down with the low-income consumer, that absolutely is going to put pressure on visits into the [quick-service retail] industry. Second thing is there is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer. I think we could all speculate the reasons for that, probably tariffs and the impact that, that might have, questions around employment situation,\" Kempczinski said.",
      "According to Kempczinski, the decline in traffic from low-income consumers \u2014 a core demographic for fast-food restaurants \u2014 is an industrywide trend, with breakfast menus across the quick service industry taking the biggest hit.",
      "Why skip breakfast?",
      "As many Americans rein in discretionary spending, industry analysts and executives say one of the first items on the chopping block is breakfast. Instead of heading to the drive-thru for a breakfast sandwich, more Americans are opting to grab something at home, or skip the meal altogether.",
      "\"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they do that with,\" Wendy's interim CEO Ken Cook said on the company's earnings call Aug. 8.",
      "That's a stark contrast to the breakfast boom fast-food chains have enjoyed for nearly a decade, which led many restaurants over the years to expand their early morning offerings. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items. Wendy's\u00a0reintroduced\u00a0breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs.",
      "The cost of fast food has also skyrocketed over the past decade,\u00a0according\u00a0to 2024 report by FinanceBuzz. The personal finance site found that the price of a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal from McDonald's more than doubled in price from $5.39 in 2014 to $11.99 in 2024.",
      "To be sure, reports of slowing traffic at fast-food chains have preceded the recent decline in breakfast sales. On an earnings call in May 2024, McDonald's CEO Kempczinski expressed \"heightened anxiety\" about how the economy was weighing on lower- and middle-income Americans. During that same time, the CEO of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP,\u00a0told\u00a0CNBC that casual restaurants were also seeing a drop in low-income customers.",
      "Still, not all fast-food chains are experiencing declines in breakfast traffic. Both Starbucks and Dunkin' told CBS MoneyWatch they've seen success with breakfast sales.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, both McDonald's and Wendy's pointed to their earnings reports.",
      "What falling breakfast sales say about the economy",
      "Experts say that American consumers' decision to skip out on breakfast points to myriad economic pressures facing low- and middle-income consumers ranging from sky-high credit card interest rates to inflation.",
      "\"The fact that the breakfast day part is slowing now, in our opinion, speaks to heightened economic uncertainty and the lower consumer confidence that we've seen, and that really escalated as tariff rhetoric came into the picture,\" Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The consumer is very value focused, discerning and selective about how they're spending. I think we would say we think breakfast is the easiest meal to cut because consumers can eat something quickly,\" Todd said.",
      "Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch that low- and middle-income Americans have been spending more cautiously since the end of last year, in part due to a \"weakening\" labor market. \"That's adding to their nervousness and their caution so far this year,\" he said.",
      "The most recent jobs report showed hiring slowed in July. The Labor Department also sharply revised job growth for May and June down by a combined 258,000, a sign that hiring was weaker than previously estimated. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June.",
      "Experts also told CBS MoneyWatch that low-income consumers' purchasing power is already under pressure due to inflation \u2014 something they said\u00a0tariffs could exacerbate. The Consumer Price Index in July showed inflation held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis. Restaurant prices are up 3.9% since July of last year and 0.3% from June.",
      "\"If they have to spend more to buy a pair of shoes or get their hair cut, they're gonna have less to spend on everything else again, including breakfast at a fast-food restaurant,\" Zandi said.",

      "The Social Security Administration makes a cost-of-living adjustment each year to ensure benefits payments for U.S. seniors keep pace with inflation. The yearly adjustment, which the agency is scheduled to announce in October, would go into effect in January 2026.",
      "The SSA did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Each fall, the agency uses inflation data from July, August and September to determine the COLA for the next year. The consumer price index (CPI), a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers that tracks the change in prices on everyday items over time, showed that the inflation rate in July held steady at 2.7% on an annual basis, the same as it was in June.",
      "The inflation rate has remained at or below 3% since the start of 2025. However, experts predict it could inch up later in the year as tariffs put more pressure on consumer prices. Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, told CBS MoneyWatch that he estimates headline CPI will rise to 3.7% and core CPI will rise to 3.8% by the second quarter of 2026.",
      "Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at New York City's New School, believes inflation will likely rise and is concerned that a moderate cost-of-living adjustment \"probably won't be enough to cover the inflation rates that we're headed into,\" AARP reported.",
      "Martha Shedden, the president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, echoed that concern, telling CBS MoneyWatch that based on the current way COLA is calculated, the increase\u00a0is \"not keeping up with seniors' true expenses.\"",
      "According the the AARP, the 2.5% COLA adjustment introduced this year boosted the average Social Security retiree's payment by about $49 a month. The average monthly Social Security check for all beneficiaries was $1,861 in June 2025 and $2,005 for retired workers,\u00a0according to the Senior Citizens League.",
      "In addition to the COLA, some senior citizens will also benefit from a provision included in President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" which provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for Americans aged 65 and older.",

The cautionary report comes just months after Spirit emerged from\u00a0Chapter 11 bankruptcy.",
      "In a quarterly report issued Monday, Spirit pointed to \"adverse market conditions\" that it's continued to face despite recent restructuring and other efforts to revamp offerings.",
      "That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year \u2014 among other challenges and \"uncertainties in its business operations\" that the Florida-based company expects to continue \"for at least the remainder of 2025.\"",
      "More Americans are cutting back on travel this year because of economic worries, according to a recent LendingTree study.",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to bounce back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its looming debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",

      "The S&P 500 rose 1.1% and was on track to top its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 473 points, or 1.1%, as of 2:46 p.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher and also heading toward a record.",
      "Stocks got a lift from hopes that the better-than-expected inflation report will give the Federal Reserve leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September.",
      "Lower rates would give a boost to investment prices and to the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment. President Donald Trump has angrily been calling for cuts to help the economy, often\u00a0insulting\u00a0the Fed's chair personally while doing so.",
      "But the Fed has been hesitant because of the possibility that Trump's tariffs could make inflation much worse. Lowering rates would give inflation more fuel, potentially adding oxygen to a growing fire. That's why Fed officials have said they wanted to see more data come in about inflation before moving.",
      "Tuesday's report said U.S. consumers paid prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were 2.7% higher in July than a year earlier. That's the same inflation rate as June's, and it was below the 2.8% that economists expected.",
      "The report pushed traders on Wall Street to increase bets that the Fed will cut interest rates for the first time this year in September. They're betting on a 94% chance of that, up from nearly 86% a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.",
      "The Fed will receive one more report on inflation, as well as one more on the U.S. job market, before its next meeting, which ends Sept. 17. The most recent jobs report was a stunner, coming in much weaker than economists expected.",
      "Some economists warn that more twists and turns in upcoming data could make the Fed's upcoming decisions not so easy. Its twin goals are to get inflation to 2% while keeping the job market healthy, and helping one with interest rates often means hurting the other.",
      "Even Tuesday's better-than-expected inflation report had some discouraging undertones. An underlying measure of inflation, which economists say does a better job of predicting where inflation may be heading, hit its highest point since early this year, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. That helped cause some up-and-down swings for Treasury yields in the bond market.",
      "\"Eventually, tariffs can show up in varying degrees in consumer prices, but these one-off price increases don't happen all at once,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"That will confound the Fed and economic commentators for months to come.\"",

      "On the losing side of Wall Street was Celanese, which sank 14.1% even though the chemical company delivered a better profit than expected. It said that customers in most of its markets continue to be challenged, and CEO Scott Richardson said that \"the demand environment does not seem to be improving.\"",
      "Cardinal Health dropped 7.2% despite likewise reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts, and analysts said the market's expectations were particularly high for the company after its stock had already soared 33.3% for the year coming into the day.",

      "The Consumer Price Index in July rose 2.7% on an annual basis, slightly cooler than economists had forecast.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.8% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%, in line with economists' forecasts.",
      "The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in prices on everyday items such as food and apparel over time. So far this year, inflation has stayed at 3% or lower, with\u00a0June's CPI reading at 2.7%, above the Fed's 2% annual target.",
      "So-called core inflation, a measure or CPI that excludes food and energy prices (which are more volatile), rose by 3.1% over the past 12 months, the highest level in five months. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 3% increase for that measure.",
      "Food inflation continues",
      "Overall food prices in July rose 0.2% from the previous month, and 2.9% over the past year. The cost of groceries last month rose 0.1% since June and 2.2% on an annual basis.",
      "The data comes as about half of Americans say the\u00a0cost of groceries is a\u00a0\"major\" source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it's a \"minor\" source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 14% say it's not a source of stress, underscoring the pervasive anxiety most Americans continue to feel about the cost of daily food essentials.",
      "Everyday staples that saw significant cost increases in July include coffee, up 2.6% from June and 14.8% from 2024. Ground beef, rose 2.4% from June and 11.5% from 2024. On a positive note, egg prices fell 3.4% from June, but were still 16.4% higher than they were in July of last year.",
      "Eating out continues to grow more costly as restaurant prices in July increased 0.3% from the previous month and 3.9% since 2024. The data comes as fast-food restaurants continue to report declines in traffic, as higher prices drive consumers away. Wendy's, for example, cut its sales outlook\u00a0last week, pointing to heightened competition and economic uncertainty weighing on its customer base.",
      "Fast-food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from\u00a0Bankrate, among households earning less than $50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, recently told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Gasoline prices, meanwhile, fell 0.5% from June and 9.5% from July 2024, the CPI data shows.",
      "What the experts say about the impact of tariffs",
      "Economists have been watching closely to determine how tariffs might trickle through to the CPI data. For the first several months of the year, the impact appeared to be limited, but June's reading indicated that the levies might be starting to drive up prices in certain categories such as apparel, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union are now subject to a new round of reciprocal tariffs that went into effect on Aug. 7.",
      "The figures from today's CPI report suggest that while the prices of certain imported goods such as shoes and furniture rose from June to July, the cheaper cost of gas is offsetting some of the impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "\"There is some sign of tariff pass through to consumer prices but, at this stage, it is not significant enough to ring alarm bells,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist a Principal Asset Management, said in an email to CBS News after today's CPI report was released.",
      "During a call with media yesterday, Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, said the investment bank expects consumers will start to see the direct effects of the tariffs this year or into early next year.",
      "\"It's possible that these tariff-induced price increases are a one-time price level shock that will start coming down early next year,\" said Detmeister. \"We think they're going to be much more lasting.\"",
      "Detmeister expects both core and headline CPI to peak in the second quarter of 2026, with headline CPI at 3.7% and core CPI at 3.8%.",
      "What the inflation data could mean for a Fed rate cut",
      "With the CPI in July rising to annualized rate of 2.7%, inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target rate, however, most analysts say that the possibility of a Fed rate cut in September is likely still on the table.",
      "\"Although core annual inflation is back to its highest level since February, today's CPI print is not hot enough to derail the Fed from cutting rates in September,\" said Shah.",
      "The latest jobs report showed that hiring slowed in July, which could bolster the case for a Fed rate cut.",
      "The Fed's mandate is to maintain maximum employment, while keeping prices down. Otherwise, the country\u00a0could slip into what's called stagflation\u00a0\u2014 which is when high inflation is coupled with high unemployment.",
      "More economic data \u2014 in the form of another CPI and jobs report \u2014 is expected next month, which will inform the central bank's decision.",

      "President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0is suggesting that the agency suspend its monthly jobs report, an economic staple that is relied upon by the Federal Reserve and U.S. businesses to gauge the health of the economy.",
      "In an interview on Fox News Digital on Monday ahead of his nomination, E.J. Antoni criticized the monthly employment report as flawed and suggested it be replaced with \"more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",

Mr. Trump took issue with large revisions made to the previous month's jobs data, although jobs number revisions are commonly issued by the agency as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "\"How on earth are businesses supposed to plan \u2014 or how is the Fed supposed to conduct monetary policy \u2014 when they don't know how many jobs are being added or lost in our economy? It's a serious problem that needs to be fixed immediately,\" Antoni told Fox News Digital.",
      "He added, \"Until it is corrected, the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.\"",
      "While some survey recipients immediately respond to the BLS' surveys, others report data later, which leads to the monthly revisions. Despite this, the BLS issues its monthly jobs report in order to report employment information in a timely manner, even though it is subject to revisions \u2014 both up and down \u2014 in later reports.",
      "Asked whether the BLS would continue to release monthly jobs reports, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"I believe that is the plan and that's the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust.\"",

      "GOP officials in the state have threatened to arrest the lawmakers to compel their appearance at the state Capitol, and one Republican senator enlisted the help of the FBI to track down the legislators.",
      "The Democrats' return comes after they saw another victory with a push by California Democrats to combat the GOP advantage. Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom formally announced a redistricting plan which, under California law, would require a special election. The California governor said the effort is happening \"in reaction to a president of the United States that called a sitting governor of the state of Texas and said 'find me five seats.'\"",
      "\"I know they say don't mess with Texas,\" Newsom said. \"Well, don't mess with the great Golden State.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: After President Trump's Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin, we will go one-on-one with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Following the Russian president's warm welcome to Alaska and a three-hour meeting that ended abruptly, President Trump adopts Putin's road map for ending the war in Ukraine, no cease-fire, but negotiations for a lasting peace in the 3.5-year conflict.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): I think the meeting was a 10 in the sense that we got along great. And it's good when two big powers get along.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what about the other countries, like Ukraine and its Western allies, who are still tightly aligned?",
      "Along with Rubio, we will hear from Trump's former National Security Council Russia expert Fiona Hill, Alaska Republican Senator Dan Sullivan, and Colorado Democrat Jason Crow.",
      "Plus, World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres will join us following his trip to Gaza.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders are heading to Washington Monday to meet with President Trump to discuss next steps following Mr. Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin. The awkward conclusion to Friday's summit yielded no formal agreement, with Vladimir Putin still insisting that Ukraine turn over the lands seized by Russia in the war, plus additional territory, something that President Zelenskyy continues to refuse.",
      "We begin with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who attended those talks in Anchorage.",
      "Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Good morning. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin did not give President Trump the cease- fire he sought. And now Putin says the root causes of the conflict have to be resolved in a peace agreement.",
      "Isn't the root cause the fact that Russia invaded in the first place?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, ultimately, yes.",
      "But, I mean, what he means by root causes is this long historical complaints that we've heard repeatedly. This is not a new argument. He's been making this for a long time. And it's the argument that it's Western encroachment. I don't want to get into \u2013 it's just so long.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But the bottom line is that all of \u2013 you know, we're not going to focus on all of that stuff. We're going to focus on this, are they going to stop fighting or not, and what it's going to take to stop the fighting.",
      "And what it's going to take to stop the fighting, if we're being honest and serious here, is, both sides are going to have to give, and both sides should expect to get something from this. And that's a very difficult thing to do. It's very difficult, because Ukraine obviously feels, you know, harmed, and rightfully so, because they were invaded, and the Russian side, because they feel like they have got momentum in the battlefield, and frankly, don't care, don't seem to care very much about how many Russian soldiers die in this endeavor.",
      "They just churn through it. So I think what the president deserves a lot of credit for is the amount of time and energy that his administration is placing on reaching a peace agreement for a war that's not a war that started under him. It's half \u2013 you know, it's on the other side of the world.",
      "That said, I mean, it's relevant to us. But there are a lot of other issues he could be focused on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So, tomorrow, we'll be meeting with President Zelenskyy. We'll be meeting with European leaders. We just met with Putin. He's dedicated a lot of time and energy because he has made it a priority of his administration to stop or end war, stop wars or prevent them.",
      "And, right now, this is the biggest war going on in the world. It's the biggest war in Europe since World War II. We're going to continue to do everything we can to reach an agreement that ends the dying and the killing and the suffering that's going on right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "You know this well, how long these kind of diplomatic negotiations often take. President Trump was telling European leaders what was discussed was Putin demanding control of Donetsk, a region in the east that his forces do not fully hold. And the U.K. estimates that taking that full area could be as long as another four years.",
      "Putin also is demanding Russian be an official language in Ukraine and something regarding Russian Orthodox churches. Did the U.S. accept all of what Putin laid out at that table?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The United States is not in a position to accept anything or reject anything, because, ultimately, it's up to the Ukrainians. They're the ones that Russia has to make peace with, and Ukraine with Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president said he did come to some agreements.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's up to the Ukrainians to make these conditions.",
      "Well, the agreements were that we were going to try to do things like, for example, get a leader \u2013 a leaders meeting. We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war.",
      "Now, there were some concepts and ideas discussed that we know the Ukrainians could be very supportive of in that meeting. I don't think it's \u2013 we're not going to negotiate this in the media. I understand that everybody wants to know what happened.",
      "But, ultimately, there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs, that are potentials for progress. We'll be discussing that more in depth tomorrow with our European allies, with the Ukrainians that are coming over. We'll be discussing all of these things, because, ultimately, we do need to find areas where we're making progress and try to begin to narrow the gap between the two sides.",
      "But there's a reason why this war has been going on for 3.5 years. And that is, when it comes to the big issues here, there are still some big differences between both sides. Let's see how much progress we can continue to make. It's \u2013 it's \u2013 it's not been easy, but it's something the president has made a priority, peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And he deserves a lot of credit for that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, ultimately, if \u2013 if Vladimir Putin is going to be offered land that he has not seized yet, but negotiates his way into, doesn't this set a dangerous precedent that the United States now accepts this concept that it is OK to seize land by force?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, Putin has already seized land by force, and that, in and of itself, is not a positive precedent. This whole war is a negative president \u2013 precedent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you demanding withdrawal?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, again, here's the \u2013 in order to have a deal here to end \u2013 to reach the end of this conflict, both sides are going to have to make concessions. That's just a fact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But does that mean accepting\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: In any negotiation, if\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 where Russian forces are now?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, no, but, if \u2013 but this is not about acceptance. This is about what Ukraine can accept and what Russia can accept. They both have to accept it. Otherwise, there won't be a peace deal, OK?",
      "If there aren't concessions, if one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender. That's called the end of the war through surrender. And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender or anything close to it.",
      "So, in order for there to be a peace deal \u2013 this is just a fact. We may not like it, it may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful, but in order for there to be an end of the war, there are things Russia wants that it cannot get, and there are things Ukraine wants that it's not going to get.",
      "Both sides are going to have to give up something in order to get to the table in order to make this happen. That's \u2013 that's just the way it is. And, I mean, the sooner we accept that, that's the reality.",
      "Now, what those things are is going to be up to both sides. There's no conditions that can be imposed on Ukraine. They're going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too. And so, for example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to have \u2013 to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security.",
      "That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on. Territories will have to be discussed. It's just a fact. And there are things that maybe Russia is holding now that they're going to have to give up. Who knows?",
      "The point is, we need to create a scenario where that becomes possible. And that's why this has been so hard, because neither side, up to now, has been willing to give on some of these things. But we'll see if that's possible. It may not be, but we're going to try, and we're going to do everything we can to try to achieve a peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand you \u2013 you can't get into specifics in a public conversation, but we're looking at Russian troops and strikes intensifying. Did you hear anything from Vladimir Putin that indicated he is willing to make a single concession?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think there are a couple. I mean, there were not enough for Ukraine. If not, we would be announcing a peace deal this morning, right?",
      "But \u2013 but, certainly, there are some things we notice, changes. There are some changes that I think are possible. I think there's some concepts that were discussed that could potentially lead to something. But, again, all these things have to be verifiable. We \u2013 it isn't real until it's real.",
      "I mean, you \u2013 one thing is what you say you might be willing to consider. Another thing is your willingness to do it. And it always becomes a tradeoff in all of this. But you talk about the intensifying strikes on the Russian side. Yes, I mean, they're a full-time war machine. I mean, that's what's happening. The Russian economy has basically been turned into a full-time wartime economy.",
      "They have a lot of people. It's a big country. It's not just large geographically. It has huge populations. It continues to churn through people. You know, they lost \u2013 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed last month in July in this war. That just tells you the price they're willing to pay.",
      "Not saying any of this is admirable. I'm saying that this is the reality of the war that we're facing. It's become attrition in some ways. It's a meat grinder, and they just have more meat to grind.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about the security bit you just mentioned there, because Italy's prime minister says that President Trump revived the idea of security guarantees inspired by NATO's Article 5 and a collective security clause that would involve the United States.",
      "How does that work?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are these U.S. troops? Are these U.S. monitors?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, that's what we're going to be working on. Well, that's what we're going to be working on.",
      "That's why \u2013 that's one of the reasons why, you know, I talked yesterday to all the national security advisers, a bunch of them from the different European countries. There are European leaders coming here tomorrow, heads of state coming tomorrow, along with President Zelenskyy, to discuss this in more detail.",
      "I mean, the constructs of something like this needs to be built out. Once thing \u2013 it's \u2013 a concept is one thing. The reality, you know, how it's built and how it would work, is another. But those are the kinds of talks that we're going to be having with them, along with some of the other issues that are at play.",
      "But that \u2013 that is one of the \u2013 if you were to break this thing down, I mean, there are \u2013 obviously, there needs to be an agreement on territories and where the lines are going to be drawn. That's not going to be very easy. That's going to be tough. I think there has to be some discussion about security guarantees for Ukraine, because they don't want this war to \u2013 none of us want to see this war in the future.",
      "They're a sovereign country. They have a right to have security agreements with other countries and security alliances with other countries. And then there's the whole issue of reconstruction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including United States?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: How do you rebuild the country?",
      "Well, potentially. Like I said, that's what we're going to be having a conversation about, and that's what we're going to be meeting \u2013 that's why they're all coming here tomorrow. And that's why we've been talking on the phone for the last 48 hours with them.",
      "And even leading up to it, throughout the week, there were various meetings just to sort of build out some of these ideas. So all of these right now are ideas. They are concepts that require some more specificity. We'll need to work with our partners to see what that looks like.",
      "And I think that's an area where potential progress is real, but that alone won't be enough. There's a bunch of other things that have to be worked through here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, Russia claims it has rescued 700,000 children. I know you know that the warrant out for Vladimir Putin's arrest is for the state-sponsored abduction of kids.",
      "I have seen estimates there are something like 30,000 Ukrainian children who have been abducted. Is the United States demanding, or at least, even just as a statement of goodwill here, that Russia return these children?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean, we've repeatedly raised that issue on \u2013 in every forum possible.",
      "And those have also been, by the way, topics of discussion, not just in our meetings with the Ukrainians, but in the negotiations and talks that were going on between Ukraine and Russia at the technical level. These talks were going on in Turkey, as an example, Turkey, over the last few months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, and nothing so far from the Russians.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's been a topic of discussion as well.",
      "Well, it's unfortunate. Children should be returned to their families. We - - on that position, I don't think there's any ambiguity on our side. And they shouldn't even be, you know, a bargaining chip in regards to a broader negotiation.",
      "But it's just one more element of how tragic this war is. After 3.5 years, this war is getting worse. It's not getting better. You've made the point about the uptick in strikes. This is a war. It's going to get worse. It's not going to get better. And that's why the president is investing so much time in bringing this to an end.",
      "And, by the way, everyone is begging us to be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The Europeans want us involved. The Ukrainians want us involved. Obviously, the Russians want us involved, because the president is the only leader in the world \u2013 if this is possible, he's the only one that can help make it happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he's got the leverage over Vladimir Putin if he wanted to crush his economy or at least do more damage to it.",
      "But you have held off on those secondary sanctions. President Trump told Fox News his advice to President Zelenskyy is: \"Make a deal. Russia's a very big power and they're not.\"",
      "You know there is concern from the Europeans that President Zelenskyy is going to be bullied into signing something away. That's why you have these European leaders coming as back up tomorrow. Can you reassure them?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, it isn't. That's not why they're coming as back \u2013 that's not true. No, but that's not \u2013 why would \u2013 that's not true.",
      "They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming \u2013 in fact, they're coming here tomorrow because\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that February Oval Office meeting in front of television cameras, where President Zelenskyy was dressed down\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Do you know how many meetings we've had since then?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, no, I know. And I was just up in Alaska\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, but we've had a bunch of meetings since then.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 watching the one with Vladimir Putin, where a red carpet was rolled out for the Russian leader.",
      "It was very different.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, but with Zelenskyy \u2013 we've had more meetings - - we've had \u2013 we've had \u2013 we've had one meeting with Putin and like a dozen meetings with Zelenskyy.",
      "So, that \u2013 but that's not true. They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're coming here tomorrow because we've been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. There were meetings in the U.K. over the following \u2013 the previous weekend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they said President Trump was going to demand a cease-fire.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The president's talked to these leaders as early as Thursday.",
      "No, no, but you said that they're coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming here tomorrow \u2013 this is such a stupid media narrative that they're coming here tomorrow because the \u2013 Trump is going to bully Zelenskyy into a bad deal.",
      "We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff. They're coming here tomorrow because they chose to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president told those European leaders last week that he wanted a cease-fire. The president went on television, said he would walk out of the meeting if Vladimir Putin didn't agree with on \u2013 he said there would be severe consequences if he didn't agree to one. He said he'd walk out in two minutes.",
      "He spent three hours talking to Vladimir Putin, and he did not get one. So, there's some mixed messages.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Because, obviously, something \u2013 things happened during that meeting.",
      "Well, because obviously things \u2013 look, our goal here is not to stage some production, for the world to say, oh, how dramatic. He walked out. Our goal here is to have a peace agreement, to end this war, OK? And, obviously, we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress, not a lot of progress, but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.",
      "If not, we wouldn't be having Zelenskyy flying all the way over here. We wouldn't be having all the Europeans coming all the way over here. Now, understand, and take with a grain of salt, I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.",
      "You talk about the sanctions. Look, at the end of the day, if peace is not going to be possible here, and this is just going to continue on as a war, people will continue to die by the thousands. The president has that option to then come in and impose new sanctions.",
      "But if he did this now \u2013 the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks. You've basically locked in at least another year to year-and-a-half of war and death and destruction. We may unfortunately wind up there, but we don't want to wind up there.",
      "We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war, so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here. We're going to do everything possible to make that happen, if it's doable.",
      "It will require both sides to make concessions. It will require both sides to get things they're asking for. That's how these deals are made, whether we like it or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, quickly, why did the State Department just announce that they're halting visitor visas for all Gazans coming here for medical aid? Why would some of these kids, for example, who are coming to hospitals for treatment be a threat?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, it's not just kids. It's a bunch of adults that are accompanying them.",
      "Second, we had outreach from multiple congressional offices asking questions about it. And so we're going to reevaluate how those visas are being granted, not just to the children, but how those visas are being granted to the people who are accompanying them, and, by the way, to some of the organizations that are facilitating it.",
      "There is evidence been presented to us by numerous congressional offices that some of the organizations bragging about and involved in acquiring these visas have strong links to terrorist groups like Hamas. And so we are not going to be in partnership with groups that are friendly with Hamas.",
      "So we need to \u2013 we're going to pause those visas. There was just a small number of them issued to children, but they come with adults accompanying them, obviously. And we are going to pause this program and reevaluate how those visas are being vetted and what relationship, if any, has there been by these organizations to the \u2013 to the process of acquiring those visas.",
      "We're not going to be in partnership with groups that have links or sympathies towards Hamas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, we have to leave it there for this morning. Thank you for joining us.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow.",
      "Good to see you in person.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW (D-Colorado): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we start talking about Ukraine, I want to pick up on something, since you sit on the Intelligence Committee.",
      "The secretary of state just said that lawmakers had come to the Trump administration with information that they have been granting visas to individuals with ties to Hamas or with organizations with ties to Hamas. That's a pretty stunning accusation. Israel controls who enters and exits Gaza.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States screens all visas. So is there really a blind spot that you are aware of?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I'm not aware of that. But, if that's true, actually, that is concerning. That would be a problem. I mean, Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. They should not be traveling anywhere. So, if that's happening, it should be stopped immediately. And the Intelligence Committee has a role to play in that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Intelligence Committee wasn't behind the information presented to the secretary of state?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I have not been briefed on that. I have no information about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "On Ukraine, you know that the U.S. intelligence assessment is that the battlefield is turning in Russia's favor, despite the fact that Putin has to rely on Iran and North Korea to keep this thing going. If neither President Biden nor President Trump were ever willing to commit troops, doesn't the secretary have a point that it has to be hammered out at the negotiating table?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You know, this absolutely will end at a negotiating table, like most conflicts will.",
      "But what happened on Friday was a historic embarrassment for the United States. There's no other way to put it, right? You listen to what Marco Rubio and the president have said. They keep on saying they're dedicating time. They're making it a priority. They're focusing their attention on it.",
      "In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary. What is making Vladimir Putin tick in this instance? Vladimir Putin does not care about the amount of time that we're nego \u2013 we're allocating to this, does not care about a B-2 bomber flyover, does not care about a lineup of F-22 fighters rolled out.",
      "He doesn't care about any of that. What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things. He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions. He cares about political, diplomatic isolation, being a pariah state. And he cares about military defeat. Those are the three things that will end this conflict, if he feels pressure on all of those three fronts.",
      "And this administration continues to be unwilling to do anything to assert pressure in any of those three areas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they have put in place some secondary sanctions, at least on India here. And they haven't pulled back. They would need Congress to help them repeal a lot of these sanctions.",
      "But bigger picture, in hindsight, do you think the United States to date has been too hesitant to actually help Ukraine win this war? President Obama did not send offensive weapons to Ukraine. President Biden was criticized for being perhaps too slow in delivery of certain weapons.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, there's no doubt.",
      "As you know, I was one of the members of Congress that on a bipartisan basis pushed really hard in the first two years of this war under the Biden administration to do more, to do more quicker. And I was concerned that we were doing just enough to prevent Ukraine from losing and not doing enough to help them win.",
      "And I do believe that, had we done more, and we had done \u2013 done it faster, and that we were willing to be more aggressive in providing aid and support for Ukraine, then they would be in a different position on the battlefield today.",
      "But compare that to what this administration has done, which has relieved almost all pressure. Like, look at what happened on Friday.",
      "U.S. military personnel in uniform literally were on their hands and knees rolling out a red carpet for the most murderous dictator of the 21st century, somebody who has kidnapped and is holding prisoner tens of thousands of Ukrainian children, somebody who started this whole war, right?",
      "This both-sides-ism that the administration is engaging in, that both sides need to come to the table and negotiate, Ukraine is the victim. They are the victim. They didn't start this war. Russia did. And somehow we keep on acting like Vladimir Putin deserves to be brought out into the open like any other head of state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This is a historic embarrassment and defeat for U.S. foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have served this country in uniform.",
      "I wonder, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, how comfortable you would be with the United States giving this, whatever the Article 5- like security guarantee would look like. Is that something you should see boots on the ground to do?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I don't think boots on the ground would be the way to go, but, certainly, the United States has assets and capability that I think are essential to any type of security guarantee.",
      "I think Europe has to come forward with the forward presence of military, but we can provide intelligence. We can provide economic support, diplomatic support. One of the most important things that we can do right now is actually seize Russian assets. This would be huge. This would be a game-changing thing that would put pressure on Vladimir Putin and actually create security guarantees and reconstruction for Ukraine.",
      "There's over $150 billion of seized Russian assets. And the United States could lead a coalition to seize that money\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 allocate it towards reconstruction, allocate it towards security, allocate it towards the building of a Ukrainian military that could actually resist Russia going forward. But this administration is unwilling to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The last administration was too.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They did agree to the legislation.",
      "But on the immigration front, you and your fellow Democratic lawmakers are now trying to challenge the Trump administration's policy that requires notice to be given before you visit an immigration facility. You just did visit some. What did you see? And how does that compare to the last administration?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, there's an ICE detention center in my district in Aurora, Colorado. I have visited that center 10 times now over the last five years, six years.",
      "And oversight of federal facilities is one of the most important things that any member of Congress does, Air Force bases, military bases, VA hospitals, and ICE detention centers. This administration just tripled the budget of ICE, made it the largest federal law enforcement agency in the history of the United States, bigger than the FBI, ATF, DEA, all others combined.",
      "And they are putting in roadblocks to prevent oversight, to prevent transparency because they are trying to hide what they are doing. That is unacceptable. So we filed a lawsuit to force them to abide by federal law that guarantees us access.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And we will see where that heads next.",
      "Jason Crow, thank you.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back. Stay with us.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "Fiona Hill served as the senior director for Russia and European affairs on the National Security Council during President Trump's first term. She joins us now from Waterville, Maine.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "FIONA HILL (Former NSC Senior Director, European and Russian Affairs): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Fiona, you were an advisor during that infamous Helsinki summit in 2018. You've spoke about that in the past. I wonder what you think about how this Alaska summit compared.",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, obviously quite different in \u2013 in many respects. Part of it was the fact that they decided to skip the one-on-one meeting and the lunch. I mean these are usually part of this sort of set of summits like this. And the press conference, obviously, was more of an announcement or a set of announcements. Presentations by both leaders, much more by President Putin, and more of a commentary by President Trump. So, there wasn't that free for all of press questions, which I'm sure was a bit disconcerting for you and others who were present there at Alaska.",
      "But the optics weren't exactly great, as Congressman Crow has laid out, for the United States and for President Trump again. I mean, again, different. But although it was presented as perhaps a show of power by being at a U.S. Air Force Base with the flight passing of the B-52s and the fighter jets, it did certainly looked much more like a show of appreciation for Vladimir Putin. And so the optics were really much more favorable to Putin than they were to the United States. It really looked like Putin set the agenda there, the narrative, and in many respects the tone for the whole summit meeting.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, saying that, you know, the president has a team of advisors around him. In a traditional administration, those advisors would be setting the policy, they would be planning the optics, and they would be thinking through that.",
      "Do you think that the president's team set him up for success here?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, look, it may well have been that one of the demands, because we've heard from Secretary Rubio, which, I have to say, I think was a very fair assessment of where things are. So, it may well have been that one of the demands by the Russians to make any progress in moving further forward was to actually have that kind of show of pomp and pageantry that is \u2013 basically marks Putin's re-entry into international affairs. Maybe the Russians said to them in Moscow, either to Steve Witkoff or to Secretary Rubio or to anybody else that basically they wanted to have a \u2013 a major U.S./Russia bilateral summit appearance before they would move on to the nitty-gritty of anything else in Ukraine. That's, you know, to give them all the benefit of the doubt there.",
      "But it all now depends on what comes out of this. And I think, again, Secretary Rubio made it very clear that it's not going to be easy. He was certainly downplaying any expectations of a major breakthrough, but he did say that it was something that might be possible. And I think that's what's going to be the proof of whether this was actually worth all the effort that they went to in Alaska or not.",
      "And as Congressman Crow said, there's a pretty high bar here because what Putin is doing is pretty brutal. And he's not showing right now any signs whatsoever of giving anything up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom's defense secretary has said that they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help oversee a ceasefire. When you hear these security guarantees being talked about, and the secretary said he is going to negotiate that tomorrow, what should we think \u2013 you know, what form is that going to take? What do you think that should look like?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, look, I think he actually let this out, and you did too in your questions. And I think Congressman Crow has made it very clear as well, it has to be a combination of all of the things that we've already heard discussed on the show today. You have to be able to have some boots on the ground. Congressman Crow said it doesn't have to be the United States. That's actually the case. But it actually has to be some commitment from the United States to enable European forces to actually hold that territory and to provide some security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "The United States is key in terms of its intelligence, in terms of enabling equipment and the information of the data that we would need for all of this to make a security intervention mean something. And it's also essential in terms of all kinds of other forms of equipment and defensive weaponry. We've already heard, of course, about Ukraine needing all kinds of equipment, from javelins in the past, to patriots, now in terms of an integrated missile defense system that Ukraine desperately needs. So, there's a lot there that we all know needs to be done.",
      "And what we really need to see, I think, in these meetings that will take place on Monday and moving forward, is a real commitment to the United States to work with Europeans and to work with Ukraine to make this happen.",
      "Look, this is existential also for European security. So, minimizing the role of Europe here, be it the United Kingdom, be it Poland, be it Finland, be it France, be it Germany, is not the way to go. Europe has to have an equal say in all of this. This is about Europe's future and the future of European security, not just about Ukraine's.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the dynamic between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. You know both men. You've written biographies of Vladimir Putin and, of course, you served under Donald Trump. In one of the Fox interviews that President Trump did, he said that he spoke about mail- in voting in the United States with Vladimir Putin. And during that press address, Putin also claimed that the war wouldn't have happened at all if Donald Trump had been pretty. I mean that's a counter factual, but that's something Trump often says on the \u2013 on the trail. Why would those things be discussed at all if this was about Ukraine?",
      "FIONA HILL: Exactly. Well, look, this is Vladimir Putin, as usual, trying to manipulate U.S. domestic politics. I've seen him do this over and over again, including at Helsinki when he set the president off, not in the press conference, but before that, in a whole diatribe against his political enemies because Putin deliberately asked him about this.",
      "So, Putin knows that President Trump wants to have an acknowledgment of his self-assertion, that the war wouldn't have happened had he not \u2013 had he been in the presidency. And so Putin's giving him something that plays well for President Trump and his own domestic environment. It doesn't play well in the international environment where people know things are much more complicated but it's basically gifting a concession to President Trump himself.",
      "And Putin wants to sow chaos in the American electoral system ahead of the midterms. So, of course, he's laid into this whole issue of mail-in voting. And President Trump asserted in his Fox News interview that there were no countries in the world that allow mail-in voting. Well, Russia allows mail- in voting. And if everybody wants to go out and look, they can look for themselves. In 2020, President Vladimir Putin signed into law Russians being able to vote by mail and also on the internet. And more than 30 other countries also allow some forms of mail-in voting. So, it's just not true that other countries, including Russia, don't use this. It's a pure blatant piece of manipulation, and that's the kind of thing that Putin likes to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, of course, I don't think you would endorse the outcome of that voting system and those elections are rigged in Russia, correct?",
      "FIONA HILL: Of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: And, I mean, basically Putin wants to see us tie ourselves up in knots between now and the midterms. He's trying to sew chaos. And he's just better used his time with President Trump to push that along.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: It's \u2013 again, it's a diversion. It's a distraction really from the negotiations on Ukraine because Putin doesn't really want to give anything up. So, he gives up basically something that plays well in the political arena for President Trump and something that actually plays very badly for the United States in its own political arena, which is the mail- in voting point that he made.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Fiona Hill, always appreciate your analysis. Thank you for joining us today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: During our trip to Alaska last week for the Trump/Putin summit, we talked with Alaskan Republican Senator Dan Sullivan about the strategic military importance of Alaska. We began by asking about potential offers to Putin to get him to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \"The Telegraph\" was reporting offering Putin a chance to invest in the natural resources off of Alaska's coast, in the Bearing Strait.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN (R-AK): Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with that?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, we have plenty of America investors and our allies who want to invest in Alaska's natural resources. We're having a boom here. We don't need Russian investments. We don't need Russian money. They're a competitor of ours when it comes to energy and natural resources and critical minerals. So, I doubt that's on the table. And, you know, I would not \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You'd be upset if there was?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I would not \u2013 I would not support that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleague \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And by the way, just to \u2013 on that point though, a contrast. You might remember last time I was on your show we talked about the Biden administration \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about this.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: With this great state of ours.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Shutting us down, right? I mean that was 70 executive orders to shut down, exclusively focused on Alaska, shut down our resource development economy. Our own federal government, the Biden administration, sanctioned my state more than they sanctioned Iran. What we're seeing with President Trump in his administration is a complete 180 on that. Unleashing Alaska's resource potential has been a huge focus of the president since day one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you mentioned how furious you were with the Biden administration for the executive actions they said they were taking to protect natural resources.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They said land conservation was necessary, and the indigenous population here really wanted it.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Right. Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You called it a lie.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I did call it a lie. It was a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said it was national security suicide. Trump has already reversed this.",
      "But are you at all concerned that there are short-term benefits to your state financially, but longer term real damage to the environment here?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: No. Look, Alaska has an incredible record of being able to develop our resources and protect the environment. You walk around here, you see what a pristine, beautiful environment we have here. But we know we need jobs. We need natural resource development. So, we can do both. The entire north slope of Alaska, the Nupiet (ph) community, across the board was against what the Biden administration did, which was lock up the entire natural petroleum reserve of Alaska, which was set aside by Congress to develop our resources. And then he had the audacity to say, hey, I did this on behalf of the native people. That was not true at all. It was an outrage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so, for activists or for those concerned about the damage here \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You say they just don't know what they're talking about?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, I say \u2013 well, a couple things. There's no place on the planet that has higher standards on protecting the environment than us. And if we need American energy, why would we go, like the Biden administration did, begging from Iran, Venezuela, places that have no environmental standards, when you can get it from America, from American workers, with the highest environmental standards any place on the planet. And secondly, when you have resource development, particularly in our rural communities, you see life expectancies increases \u2013 increasing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in this region \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Arctic is of supreme concern from a national security perspective.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The ice is melting.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Majority of scientists attribute that to global warming, but the end result is there's a potential for an Arctic area for trade routes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Also tapping into the natural resources there.",
      "How does the United States gain an edge in \u2013 in dominating that?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, it's a great question. It's really important. You're mentioning trade routes that are opening up. We've already talked about natural resources, which are huge, up in the Arctic. And what we need to do is recognize that we're an Arctic nation. We're an Arctic nation because of Alaska.",
      "And, look, this has not always been a priority of previous administrations. What we're doing up here, we're rebuilding our military. The one big, beautiful bill certainly does it. As I mentioned, you know, Alaska exudes military might. We're the cornerstone of missile defense, and we're going to be the cornerstone of the president's golden dome initiative. We are the hub of air combat power. You're seeing them flying over here. We have over 100 fifth generation fighters based in Alaska. We have a brand-new U.S. Army airborne division up here. So, we are building out our military, which is great, but also building out our Arctic capabilities.",
      "And again, in the one big, beautiful bill, almost $26 billion investment in the Coast Guard, which is the biggest investment in the Coast Guard in American history by far, 16 icebreakers coming with that, 22 cutters, 40 helicopters, a bunch of shore side infrastructure, a lot of that's going to be in Alaska to defend the Arctic. And we need to defend the Arctic because, as you and I have talked about, the Russians and the Chinese are in our waters and in our airspace all the time, including doing joint operations up here, which is unprecedented.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you about that because the war in Ukraine has hurt Russia's finances \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Made them more dependent on Beijing, including when it comes to exploring up and around the Arctic.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They had a joint bomber task force come here \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pretty darn close.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Oh, they were in our ADIZs, as they \u2013 as we call it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Air Defense Identification Zone.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, are you concerned this actually becomes a flashpoint?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I think this is already becoming a flash point. I mean the number of times that the Russians and Chinese are doing joint strategic bomber task forces in our airspace and joint naval task forces in our EEZ, in our waters, they're \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Economic Zone?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes. That's happening on a regular basis now, that's unprecedented. They don't do joint operations anywhere else on America's borders. That's for sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee says there is far more needed for the U.S. military than what has been provided by the White House and their budget.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: We need to do more and we certainly need to keep it above 3 percent of GDP and growing towards 4 or 5 percent of GDP. It's a dangerous world right now.",
      "But this one big, beautiful bill, the budget reconciliation bill does a lot for our military right now on urgent needs. Shipbuilding. As we have talked about, our Navy, our ability to build ships is completely atrophied. Weapons and ammo systems. The golden dome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you have your own proposal.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But has the Pentagon told you what the golden dome is?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: All right, I mean, I've been working on this with the Pentagon. This is missile defense that is a layered missile defense. So, what that means is, right here, like I said, you have the ground-based missile interceptor \u2013 the missile interceptors in Alaska. You have all the radar systems in Alaska that protect the whole country in terms of ballistic missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: We have new threats. We have hypersonics. We have drones. We have, heck, even we've seen it here in Alaska, spy balloons. What we need to do is upgrade the system with what's called a layered defense. Not just the ground-based system here, but you work it more with different systems, Aegis Ashore, THAD, and then including space-based systems, both for tracking and intercepting. And you to do that with an open architecture in terms of software to integrate those systems. So, I am very familiar with what the golden dome is doing and I'm leading the effort in the Senate on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And, by the way, my state is the cornerstone of all the missile defense right now and will continue to be so.",
      "(END VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can find more from our interview with Dan Sullivan on our website, facethenation.com and our YouTube page.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza where the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reports that the total number of starvation- related deaths has now risen to 250, including 110 children. Seven of those deaths in the last 24 hours.",
      "World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres joins us this morning from Jerusalem. He visited Gaza late last week.",
      "Good morning.",
      "JOSE ANDRES (Founder, World Central Kitchen): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It is rare to get a look inside of Gaza. The IDF does not allow journalists in to freely report. But they let you in. What did you see?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: It was a day trip. I was able to go early in the day and leave before sunset. And I visit our main \u2013 one of our two main kitchens inside Gaza in Derbala (ph). And I was able to visit the few warehouses we have there, the bakery, the kitchens. And I spending a day trying to see what else the teams need, what else we need to be doing, how we are going to be increasing the hot food and bread we are producing right now. So, it was a day again to show support, to see on my own and assess the situation of our own kitchens. And \u2013 and that's how \u2013 what I have to report with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.N. says that there is starvation happening in Gaza. Israel's prime minister says there is no starvation. What's real?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: Obviously, there is always a gray area. But we are making boxes for children that we know they are in very special need situation. I saw those boxes be made with the name of every one of the children. We need to remember that during many weeks no food was going inside Gaza. And this is to 2 million people.",
      "So, in the places we know we're feeding, we are doing around 200,000 meals a day, but this is only 10 percent of the need. That's why we are trying to increase.",
      "I can say that where we are, obviously people are \u2013 are \u2013 are being fed. At the very minimum. It's not everything they should be receiving, but at the very least they are receiving a piece of bread and a piece of food.",
      "But we need much more aid. We need to make sure that the aid is never interrupted again. We need to make sure that the flow of trucks keeps happening. We need to make sure that we have safe roads so those trucks can reach their intended delivery place. We need to make sure that all the NGOs that are actively trying to do the best they can to take care of people inside Gaza, and this is beyond food, obviously medicine, et cetera, et cetera, we need to make sure that the aid is massive enough that we don't get to those moments where in some areas, like in the north, that these are still very difficult to reach, that we know that people are desperate for food.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned for many weeks no food was allowed in. That was a government policy. There was a blockade for many months. That is now lifted officially.",
      "But as you say, your organization wants to scale up. You are trying to produce 1 million meals a day in Gaza. Can you get the fuel in to do that? Can you get the food in? Are Israeli officials giving you a green light?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: Well, it's a million because we \u2013 we are an organization that we specialize in emergencies and in food. But really we are requesting that all the NGOs that are participating in feeding are giving more access, including us, and other organizations, like Anera (ph), which was one of the organizations we work with that they have been in Gaza for many, many decades, and many others. We need to make sure that everybody has access. For that we need a lot of things. The trucks inside Gaza. We need to remember that the trucks come from outside Gaza. And they are \u2013 they are put aside. And then we need to reload the trucks that are inside Gaza. This takes time. We need more trucks inside. So, the trucking company can have enough people and enough trucks to have a constant flow.",
      "I have to report that as I saw a good flow of trucks going in, around 150 to 250 trucks are going in every day. But even I would say that this is not enough. We need to make sure that we massively increase, that we massively make sure that nobody has to be walking for miles to try to reach a place where they can find a plate of food or use a bag of rice. We need to make sure like what World Central Kitchen does. At one moment we had, you know, 100 to 200 kitchen partners. We need to make sure that we are cooking where people live. We need to make sure that we are feeding them where people are so the people don't have to be again leaving their neighborhoods, leaving their tents and walking for hours back and forth only to try to bring a little bit of food back home.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to end Russia's war in Ukraine, hinting at the road ahead for talks aimed at getting Moscow and Kyiv to reach a lasting peace agreement.",
      "\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"",
      "Full transcript: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "Full transcript: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "President Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday following his\u00a0high-stakes summit with Putin in Alaska last Friday. Mr. Trump called the nearly three-hour meeting with Putin \"extremely productive\" with \"many points\" the two leaders agreed on. But \"there's no deal until there's a deal,\" he said, and no ceasefire was announced.",
      "Rubio, who attended the summit, was thin on details Sunday, saying that \"there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs.\" He added that the details would be discussed with Zelenskyy and other European leaders on Monday as the administration works to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "\"We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war,\" Rubio said, noting that there were \"some concepts and ideas discussed\" with Putin that they expect the Ukrainians would support.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 17, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow. Good to see you in person. Before we start talking about Ukraine, I want to pick up on something, since you sit on the Intelligence Committee. The Secretary of State just said that lawmakers had come to the Trump administration with information that they've been granting visas to individuals with ties to Hamas, or with organizations with ties to Hamas. That's a pretty stunning accusation. Israel controls who enters and exits Gaza. The United States screens all visas. So, is there really a blind spot that you are aware of?",
      "REP. JASON CROW: I'm not aware of that. But if that's true, actually, that is concerning. That would be a problem. I mean, Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. They should not be traveling anywhere. So, if that's happening, it should be stopped immediately. And, you know, the Intelligence Committee has a role to play in that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Intelligence Committee wasn't behind the information presented to the Secretary of State.",
      "REP. CROW: I have not been briefed on that. I have no information about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, on Ukraine: You know that the U.S. intelligence assessment is that the battlefield is turning in Russia's favor, despite the fact that Putin has to rely on Iran and North Korea to keep this thing going. If neither President Biden nor President Trump were ever willing to commit troops, doesn't the secretary have a point that it has to be hammered out at the negotiating table?",
      "REP. CROW: You know, this absolutely will end at a negotiating table, like most conflicts will. But what happened on Friday was a historic embarrassment for the United States. There's no other way to put it. Right? You listen to what Marco Rubio and the president have said. They keep on saying they're dedicating time. They're making it a priority. They're focusing their attention on it. In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary. What is making Vladimir Putin tick, in this instance. Vladimir Putin does not care about the amount of time that we're nego- we're allocating to this, does not care about a B-2 bomber flyover, does not care about a lineup of F-22 fighters rolled out. He doesn't care about any of that. What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things. He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions. He cares about political, diplomatic isolation, being a pariah state. And he cares about military defeat. Those are the three things that will end this conflict if he feels pressure on all of those three fronts. And this administration continues to be unwilling to do anything to assert pressure in any of those three areas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they have put in place some secondary sanctions, at least on India here, and they haven't pulled back. They need Congress to help them repeal a lot of these sanctions. But bigger picture, in hindsight, do you think the United States to date has been too hesitant to actually help Ukraine win this war? President Obama did not send offensive weapons to Ukraine. President Biden was criticized for being perhaps too slow in delivery of certain weapons.",
      "REP. CROW: There's no doubt. As you know, I was one of the members of Congress that, on a bipartisan basis, pushed really hard in the first two years of this war, under the Biden administration, to do more, to do more quicker. And I was concerned that we were doing just enough to prevent Ukraine from losing and not doing enough to help them win. And I do believe that had we done more, and we had done it faster, and that we were willing to be more aggressive in providing aid and support for Ukraine, then they would be in a different position on the battlefield today. But compare that to what this administration has done, which has relieved almost all pressure. Like look at what happened on Friday. U.S. military personnel in uniform, literally, were on their hands and knees, rolling out a red carpet for the most murderous dictator of the 21st century. Somebody who has kidnapped and is holding prisoner tens of thousands of Ukrainian children. Somebody who started this whole war, right? This both-sides-ism that the administration is engaging in, that both sides need to come to the table and negotiate. Ukraine is the victim. They are the victim. They didn't start this war. Russia did. And somehow we keep on acting like Vladimir Putin deserves to be brought out into the open like any other head of state. This is a historic embarrassment and defeat for U.S. foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have served this country in uniform. I wonder, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, how comfortable you would be with the United States giving this, whatever the Article Five-like security guarantee would look like. Is that something you should see boots on the ground to do?",
      "REP. CROW: I don't think boots on the ground would be the way to go. But, certainly, the United States has assets and capability that I think are essential to any type of security guarantee. I think Europe has to come forward with the forward presence of military. But we can provide intelligence. We can provide economic support, diplomatic support. One of the most important things that we can do right now is actually seize Russian assets. This would be huge. This would be a game-changing thing that put pressure on Vladimir Putin. And actually create security guarantees and reconstruction for Ukraine. There's over $150 billion of seized Russian assets, and the United States could lead a coalition to seize that money. Allocate it towards reconstruction, allocate it towards security, allocate it towards the building of a Ukrainian military that could actually resist Russia going forward. But this administration is unwilling to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last administration was too, they--",
      "REP. CROW: --That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They did agree to the legislation. But on the immigration front, you and your fellow Democratic lawmakers are now trying to challenge the Trump administration's policy that requires notice to be given before you visit an immigration facility. You just did visit some. What did you see, and how does that compare to the last visit?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, there's an ICE detention center in my district, in Aurora, Colorado. I have visited that center 10 times now over the last five years, six years. And oversight of federal facilities is one of the most important things that any member of Congress does. Air Force bases, military bases, VA hospitals and ICE detention centers. This administration just tripled the budget of ICE. Made it the largest federal law enforcement agency in the history of the United States. Bigger than the FBI, ATF, DEA, all others combined. And they are putting in roadblocks to prevent oversight, to prevent transparency because they were trying to hide what they are doing. That is unacceptable. So we filed a lawsuit to force them to abide by federal law that guarantees us access.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll see where that heads next. Jason Crow, thank you. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, founder of World Central Kitchen, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 17, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reports that the total number of starvation-related deaths has now risen to 250, including 110 children, seven of those deaths in the last 24 hours. World Central Kitchen founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s joins us this morning from Jerusalem. He visited Gaza late last week. Good morning. It is rare to get a look inside of Gaza. The IDF does not allow journalists in to freely report, but they let you in. What did you see?",
      "JOS\u00c9 ANDR\u00c9S: It was a day trip. I was able to go early in the day and leave before sunset, and I visit our main- one of our two main kitchens inside Gaza in Deir al-Balah. And I was able to visit the few warehouses we have there, the bakery, the kitchens, and spending a day trying to see what else the teams need, what else we need to be doing, how we are going to be increasing the hot food and bread that we are producing right now. So this was a day, again, to show support, to see on my own and assess the situation of our own kitchens. And that's what I have to report about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.N. says that there is starvation happening in Gaza, Israel's Prime Minister says there is no starvation. What's real?",
      "ANDR\u00c9S: Obviously, there is always a gray area, but we are making boxes for children that we know they are in very- a special need situation. I saw those boxes being made with the name of every one of the children. We need to remember that during many weeks, no food was going inside Gaza, and this is two- two million people. So in the places we know we are feeding, we are doing around 200,000 meals a day, but this is only 10 percent of the need. That's what we are trying to increase. I can say that where we are, obviously, people are- are being fed at the bare minimum. It's not everything they should be receiving, but at the very least they're receiving a piece of bread and a piece of food. But we need much more aid. We need to make sure that the aid is never interrupted again. We need to make sure that the flow of trucks keeps happening. We need to make sure that we have safe roads so those trucks can reach their intended delivery place. We need to make sure that all the NGOs that are actively trying to do the best they can to take care of people inside Gaza- and this is beyond food, obviously, medicines, etc., etc. We need to make sure that the aid is massive enough that we don't get to those moments where- in some areas, like in the north, that is still very difficult to reach, that we know that people are desperate for food.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned for many weeks no food was allowed in. That was a government policy. There was a blockade for many months. That is now lifted officially. But as you say, your organization wants to scale up. You are trying to produce one million meals a day in Gaza. Can you get the fuel in to do that? Can you get the food in? Are Israeli officials giving you a green light?",
      "ANDR\u00c9S: Well, it's a million because we are an organization that we specialize in emergencies and in food, but obviously we are requesting that all the NGOs that are participating in feeding are given more access, including us and other organizations like Anera, which was one of the organizations we work with that they've been in Gaza for many, many decades- and many others. We need to make sure that everybody has access. For that, we need a lot of things, the trucks inside Gaza. We need to remember that the trucks come from outside Gaza, and there they are put aside. And then we need to reload the trucks that are inside Gaza. This takes time. We need more trucks inside so the trucking company can have enough people and enough trucks to have a constant flow. I have to report that, yes, I saw a good flow of trucks going in. I don't- around 150 to 250 trucks are going in every day. But even I will say that this is not enough. We need to make sure that we massively increase- that we massively make sure that nobody has to be walking for miles to try to reach a place where they can find a plate of food or use a bag of rice. We need to make sure- like what World Central Kitchen does, at one moment we had, you know, 100, 200 kitchen partners. We need to make sure that we are cooking where people live. We need to make sure that we are feeding them where people are, so the people don't have to be, again, leaving their neighborhoods, leaving their tents and walking for hours back and forth only to try to bring little bit of food back home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of walking to designated areas for food, you're referring to the model that the Israelis have set up with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. You are saying that their preferred method of feeding people is not sufficient.",
      "ANDR\u00c9S: Well, it takes a village, right? To feed 2 million people and more in a- in a situation like the people of Gaza are facing. That's why the model we are- we are pushing for is the more kitchens we have, the better. Right now, we have 80 partner kitchens on top of the two main World Central Kitchen kitchens, but that's not enough. We need to make sure that we increase the numbers of World Central Kitchen, the big ones that people can see on the webpage of World Central Kitchen or in my Twitter account. We need to make sure that our partner kitchens, that they produce between 500 and two, three, four thousand meals each. We need to make sure the bakeries are fully loaded with bread. We need to make sure that we have the fuel. That's why we need to be bringing pellets, because we have hundreds of kitchens firing up every day. We need the fuel to be able to cook the food. The big bakery we have, a bakery that was in partnership with the Kingdom of Jordan that is doing almost 50,000 loaves of bread a day. We need diesel to make sure that we are able to move the machinery to be very effective, but that's only one bakery doing 50,000 pitas a day. We need many more bakeries to make sure that we are able to- to cover the demand of 2 million people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I have to ask you about an incident that happened a few days ago. World Central Kitchen issued a statement saying the Israeli government told you armed people were posing as workers for your organization. Is that the first time that you've heard bad actors are trying to pose as humanitarian workers? Have you experienced exploitation by Hamas?",
      "ANDR\u00c9S: Obviously, World Central Kitchen, we are a young organization. Gaza is a very complicated place. I know this is still kind of under investigation on our side and everybody else. But doubly, we are there to be next to the people of Gaza, next to the Palestinians. At the end, what we have is Palestinians feeding Palestinians. Only in our kitchens, we have around 600 Palestinians doing amazing work just trying to feed their fellow citizens, and that's what we plan to continue to make sure that Palestinians feed Palestinians, that Palestinians take care of themselves, and we're going to be giving them all the support we can to achieve that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I understand you met with a former hostage while you were in- in Israel, whose brother is still being held in Gaza. What did you learn?",
      "ANDR\u00c9S: Yeah, I've been- I've been- I've been- I've been meeting with- with different- but these- I met with Iair Horn. His brother is still in Gaza. You know, we had a two hour conversation. You know, was hard to listen to the story. Obviously, he wants his brother- his brother out. Today is a very massive strike in- in Israel, and everybody is asking for the return of the hostages. That's what should be happening. That's what should be- let's hope that this happens, obviously, alongside of a cease-fire, of peace, where nobody is under bombs, where nobody has their loved ones away, where nobody is losing their loved ones in the middle of- of- of this- of this war, where everybody is fed, where we can start the reconstruction of Gaza, where every children can receive a plate of food that they can go back to school, where, obviously, the hostages are released, where the people of Palestine and Gaza can live in peace and where the people of Israel can live in peace. What is good for you must be good for me. Let's hope that you at least will cover the basic minimums right now of feeding everybody, hopefully also the hostages being released as soon as possible.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 17, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. Fiona Hill served as the Senior Director for Russia and European Affairs on the National Security Council during President Trump's first term. She joins us now from Waterville, Maine. Good morning to you.",
      "FIONA HILL: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Fiona, you were an advisor during that infamous Helsinki summit in 2018. You've spoken about that in the past. I wonder what you think about how this Alaska summit compared?",
      "HILL: Well, obviously quite different in many respects. Part of it was the fact that they decided to skip the one-on-one meeting and the lunch. I mean, these are usually part of the sort of set of summits like this. And the press conference, obviously, was more of an announcement, or a set of announcements- presentations by both leaders. Much more by President Putin, and more of a commentary by President Trump. So there wasn't that free-for-all of press questions, which I'm sure was a bit disconcerting for you and others who were present there, at Alaska. But the optics weren't exactly great, as Congressman crow has laid out for the United States and for President Trump, again, I mean, again, different, but although it was presented as perhaps a show of power by being at a US Air Force base with the fight passing of the B-52s and other fighter jets, it did certainly look much more like a show of appreciation for Vladimir Putin. And so, the optics were really much more favorable to Putin than they were to the United States. It really looked like Putin had set the agenda there, the narrative and, in many respects, the tone for the whole summit meeting.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, saying that, you know, the President has a team of advisers around him, and in a traditional administration, those advisers would be setting the policy, they would be planning the optics, and they would be thinking through that. Do you think that the President's team set him up for success here?",
      "HILL: Well, look, it may well have been that one of the demands, because we've heard from Secretary Rubio, which I have to say, I think was a very fair assessment of where things are. So it may well have been that one of the demands by the Russians to make any progress in moving further forward was to actually have that kind of show of pomp and pageantry, that basically marks Putin's re-entry into international affairs. Maybe the Russians said to them in Moscow, either to Steve Witkoff or to Secretary Rubio, or to anybody else, that basically they wanted to have a major US-Russia, bilateral summit appearance before they would move on to the nitty-gritty of anything else in Ukraine. That's to give them- them all the benefit of the doubt there. But, it all now depends on what comes out of this. And I think again, Secretary Rubio made it very clear that it's not going to be easy. He was certainly downplaying any expectations of a major breakthrough. But he did say that there was something that might be possible. I think that's what's going to be the proof of whether this was actually worth all the effort that they went to in Alaska or not. And as Congressman Crow said, there's a pretty high bar here, because what Putin is doing is pretty brutal, and he's not showing, right now, any signs whatsoever of giving anything up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom's Defense Secretary has said that they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help oversee a ceasefire. When you hear these security guarantees being talked about, and the Secretary said he is going to negotiate that tomorrow, what should we think- what form is that going to take? What do you think that should look like?",
      "HILL: Well, look, I think he actually laid this out, and you did too in your questions. And I think Congressman Crow made it very clear as well. It has to be a combination of all of the things that we've already heard discussed on the show today. You have to be able to have some boots on the ground. Congressman Crow that it doesn't have to be the United States. That's actually the case. But, it actually has to be some commitment from the United States to enable European forces to actually hold that territory and to provide some security guarantees for Ukraine. The United States is key in terms of its intelligence, in terms of enabling equipment, and the information and the data that we would need for all of this to make a security intervention mean something. And it's also essential in terms of all kinds of other forms of equipment and defensive weaponry. We've already heard, of course, about Ukraine needing all kinds of equipment, from javelins in the past, to patriots, now, in terms of an integrated missile defense system that Ukraine desperately needs. So there's a lot there that we all know needs to be done, and what we really need to see, I think, in these meetings that will take place on Monday and moving forward, is a real commitment to the United States, to work with Europeans, and to work with Ukraine to make this happen. Look, this is existential, also for European security. So, minimizing the real role of Europe here, be it the United Kingdom, be it Poland, be it Finland, be it France, be it Germany, is not the way to go. Europe has to have an equal say in all of this. This is about Europe's future and the future of European security, not just about Ukraine's.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the dynamic between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. You know both men. You've written biographies of Vladimir Putin, and of course, you served under Donald Trump. In one of the FOX interviews that President Trump did, he said that he spoke about mail-in voting in the United States with Vladimir Putin, and during that press address, Putin also claimed that the war wouldn't have happened at all if Donald Trump had been President. I mean, that's a counterfactual, but that something Trump often says on the- on the trail, why would those things be discussed at all if this was about Ukraine?",
      "HILL: Exactly. Well, look, this is Vladimir Putin, as usual, trying to manipulate U.S. domestic politics. I've seen him do this over and over again, including at Helsinki when he set the president off, not in the press conference, but before that, in a whole diatribe against his political enemies, because Putin deliberately asked him about this. So Putin knows that President Trump wants to have an acknowledgement of his self-assertion that the war wouldn't have happened had he not- had he been in the presidency. And so, Putin is giving him something that plays well for President Trump in his own domestic environment. It doesn't play well in the international environment, where people know things are much more complicated, but it's basically a gift and a concession to President Trump himself. And Putin wants to sow chaos in the American electoral system ahead of the midterms. So, of course, he's led into this whole issue of mail-in voting. And President Trump asserted in his Fox News interview that there are no countries in the world that allow mail-in voting. Well, Russia allows mail-in voting, and if everybody wants to go out and look, they can look for themselves. In 2020, President Vladimir Putin signed into law Russians being able to vote by mail and also on the internet. And more than 30 other countries also allow some forms of mail-in voting. So, it's just not true that other countries, including Russia, don't use this. It's a pure, blatant piece of manipulation, and that's the kind of thing that Putin likes to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, of course, I don't think you would endorse the outcome of that voting system and that those elections are rigged in Russia. Correct?",
      "HILL: Of course. And I mean, basically, Putin wants to see us tie ourselves up in knots between now and the midterms. He's trying to sow chaos, and he's just basically used his time with President Trump to push that along. It's, again, it's a diversion, it's a distraction, really, from the negotiations on Ukraine, because Putin doesn't really want to give anything up, so he gives up, basically, something that plays well in the political arena for President Trump and something that actually plays very badly for the United States in its own political arena, which is the mail-in voting point that he made.",

      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. \"We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the 'Coalition of the willing' \u2014 including the European Union \u2014 is ready to do its share,\" she said.",
      "Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but said much was unclear.",
      "\"It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine,\" he said, \"But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees.\"",
      "Witkoff defended Mr. Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which the president had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.",
      "\"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,\" Witkoff said, without elaborating. \"We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.\"",
      "Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.",
      "\"If he did this now, the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks,\" Rubio said. \"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here.\"",
      "Rubio said that Kyiv \"is going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too.\"",
      "\"For example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security,\" Rubio said. \"That's not an unreasonable request. That's something needs to be worked on.\"",
      "Zelenskyy and Europeans leaders, who heard from Mr. Trump after the summit, are scheduled to meet with him at the White House on Monday.",
      "\"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this,\" Rubio said.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, which was on taped Aug. 14, 2025, in Anchorage, Alaska, and aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 17. The transcript of the first part of the interview was published on Friday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator.",
      "SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for joining us in your home state.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Welcome to Alaska. The father of the U.S. Air Force called Alaska the most strategic place in the world. That's a quote by Billy Mitchell that I use a lot. And now you see why.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2014 very strategic. And I want to talk to you about a lot of things specific to the state--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014but this is the focus of the world right now\u2014",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: It is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014because of who's coming here.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So from your perspective, you're a supporter of Ukraine\u2014",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I have been.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014what does a successful Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, summit look like?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, I think the President and his team need to be commended. You know, they have put a lot of effort and energy in peace, with regard to Ukraine and Russia, like they're doing all around the world, you know, they're they're making a lot of headway on peace, whether it's the Azerbaijan-Armenia issues, Iran-Israel, Pakistan-India, they're putting a lot of energy into bringing peace to different parts of the world, but they put the most energy into this.",
      "So, look, I think a successful outcome would be, as you know, a com- negotiating peace is very complex, very difficult. Even this kind of high level diplomacy has risks for everybody, including the president and his team. The different elements of a peace agreement, starting with the ceasefire, then you would have territorial issues, concessions or not, then you have security guarantees. But I think this is a place-setting exercise that the administration believes that if they can get a ceasefire, then you would do the other elements that I talked about, the much more complex elements, with Zelenskyy, with our European and NATO allies. So I think the President is going to assess Putin's seriousness on a ceasefire. And if he assesses that, that he's serious, and Putin agrees to a ceasefire, then I think that would be success. Then you move on to the other elements for round two. So this is really preliminary, and I would call it, you know, an exercise in place-setting for the real negotiations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, watch for the ceasefire, and judge success based off of that. Well, the Kremlin has announced there's going to be this joint press conference. The White House says, we'll see, the president said maybe, maybe not. Vladimir Putin is being brought in from the cold. He's been isolated by the world for a reason. Do you think that this is rewarding bad behavior, by giving him this spotlight on the American soil?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Look, two things on that. Vladimir Putin is coming to negotiate with Trump because of the sanctions. I mean, don't take it from me. Listen to our European allies who are definitive on that. The reason Putin is even doing this is because of the threat of serious secondary sanctions. So I think that that is important. And, you know, in terms of American soil, look, I actually think Alaska is the appropriate place. Putin understands one thing, as you know, Margaret, strength and power. And my state exudes strength and power with a huge military here. By the way, we're having a giant military exercise going on right now. I hope Vladimir Putin sees a lot of that military power in the next couple of days. Unleashing American energy, which the President is doing. That's the weapon that Putin fears probably more than anything, when we can compete with them.",
      "And then this is also, you know, a place that demonstrates a huge element of American power and strength, which is our allies. We have allies doing military exercises up here as we speak, the president has been doing a great job with our European allies. Gotten NATO to get to 5%, coordinating with them all week. So I think those are really important. And then finally, you know, as an Alaskan. I think it's important, from the perspective of reminding the Russians that we are quite good negotiators, including the president of the United States. You know, last time we had a big deal with Russia in America, about my state, we got this great state for two cents an acre, $7.2 million, probably the deal of the century. And I think the Russians- I think the Russians probably have to remember that too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly. Don't you think for Vladimir Putin, who, you know, allegedly wants to reconstitute the Russian Empire, that maybe has a little bit of a different meaning for him, arriving here?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, I think he has no- I mean, who knows what they think about Alaska, but I know what Alaskans think about Russia. And you know, we're a strong state, like I said. We have enormous power right here. And so again, I think for all these reasons, this is going to be a really important summit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So- he is an indicted war criminal, for a very specific crime of kidnapping Ukrainian children. He's bombed hospitals in Syria. He's massacred people, ordered them at least, he's- he's murdered many of his own people. He's used chemical weapons on British soil. That's why he's under this kind of pressure and U.S. sanctions. Really, are you pleased that he's this close to home?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Look, like I said, I mean the- the part about\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it normalizes that, that it forgives that, that it brings him back into the fold by giving him that photo op that makes him look so powerful?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: You know, peace is difficult, right? We've had high level discussions with Reagan in Gorbachev, with Stalin, with Mao Zedong. I mean, this is what diplomacy is about, when you try to end wars. And it's- the way you end wars is, you discuss them with the leaders of these countries. Look, I'm no fan of Vladimir Putin. I don't trust anything he says. The key is, when I think what the president has done when you're dealing with a dictator, is show up with strength, and that's what the president's done. Putin is coming to the negotiating tables because he's threatened by these sanctions. The president is rebuilding our military, rebuilding our energy sector, which is critical, critical to my state, and very importantly, as I already mentioned, coordinating really closely with one of the greatest strengths we have, and that's our allies. We are an ally rich nation. Putin is ally poor, and that's a huge strength of ours.",
      "So all of these things, I think, you focus on the strength, get Putin to a ceasefire, and move forward with Ukraine, Zelenskyy, our European allies, in terms of the more complicated elements of a peace negotiation. But it starts with this. Starts with a ceasefire. And look, if President Trump assesses Putin is not being honest, you've seen, you know, a lot of frustration from the president recently saying, hey, I have these good discussions with Putin, then he's out bombing, you know, hospitals and nursing homes. If he assesses that he's not serious, then, as the president said, there'll be severe consequences. And I think that's the kind of pressure we need to keep on to try to get to what everybody wants, which is an end of this war.",
      "END PART ONE",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So if there's no ceasefire Friday, the Republican leader in the Senate is going to put that sanctions bill to a vote finally?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, I don't know what the Republican Leader John Thune is going to do I know I'm a--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you like him to?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: -- I'm an original cosponsor of that sanctions bill. I think what we've been doing right now, Lindsey Graham has been leading the charge, doing a great job, which is coordinating with the White House, but the President has already threatened sanctions against India. I think soon they should be threatening sanctions against China. They're a huge secondary buyer as well--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even as those negotiations over trade deals are ongoing?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I mean, I- look, I think with regard to buying oil and propping up the Putin war machine, the answer is yes, but we are trying to coordinate, and I think we're doing a good job with Leader Thune and Lindsey Graham on that sanctions bill, which has over 80 cosponsors. And look, there might be a time when the White House needs that, there's as you know, ongoing litigation over the tariffs, and having Congress pass legislation with regard to the tariffs makes that much more stronger from a legal perspective. But I think continuing to coordinate with the White House and when and how to do that with our leadership at this moment is the right approach.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the President has also spoken about the opportunities that might exist from a business perspective with Russia. The Telegraph was reporting offering Putin a chance to invest in the natural resources off of Alaska's coast in the Bering Strait. Are you comfortable with that?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, we have plenty of American investors and our allies who want to invest in Alaska's natural resources. We're having a boom here. We don't need Russian investments. We don't need Russian money. They're a competitor of ours when it comes to energy and natural resources and critical minerals. So I doubt that's on the table. And you know, I would not--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You'd be upset if--",
      "SEN SULLIVAN: --I would not, I would not support that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleague--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: By the way, just on that point, though, a contrast, you might remember the last time I was on your show, we talked about the Biden administration--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I want to talk about this.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: With this great state of ours, shutting us down, right? I mean, that was 70 executive orders to shut down, exclusively focused on Alaska, shut down our resource development economy. As I mentioned when I was on your show last year. You know, the- our own federal government, the Biden administration, sanctioned my state more than they sanctioned Iran. What we're seeing with President Trump and his administration is a complete",
      "180 on that, unleashing Alaska's resource potential has been a huge focus of the president since day one. He literally issued an executive order on day one. So, you know, we're getting a lot of support from this administration, great support on our economy, jobs and resource development. It's a breath of fresh air relative to the Biden administration, and I think we're going to see continued focus on that from this White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been pushing the Trump administration to invest in a project here. The state has a lot of fossil fuels, a lot of natural resources. The project's from the North Slope of Alaska, and it would bring natural gas, perhaps even to Asia, to Japan.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump announced it as a joint venture, but the FT is reporting no Asian partners have made an equity investment or entered supply contracts. What's the reality check? Where is this particular project?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: So this is the big Alaska LNG Project that we've been working on for many, many years. It is a hugely strategic project. We have more natural gas on the North Slope than probably anywhere in the whole world. We've been working on a pipeline and an LNG facility right around here to ship that out. Alaska was the first place to ship LNG anywhere. We started exporting LNG to Japan in the late 1960s.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: So right now, the Trump administration, the president and his cabinet have been pushing this project in their trade negotiation agreements. We've gotten great support from them. There's not--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not a done deal.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: It's not a done deal yet, because we are- on the private sector side, we're working on what's called the FEED work, the front-end engineering and design that's going to be done in a few months. And that's when we're going to go to these countries and go to the companies in Korea, in Japan, in Taiwan, all very interested, and say, hey, here are the off-take agreements we want you to sign. The President and his team have been working closely with the private sector on this, so we're making more progress on this, Margaret, than we've ever made before. This can be great for Alaskans. Great for our military here. But as you mentioned, this is great for our Asian allies, the Koreans, the Japanese, some of whom are still getting Russian oil and gas. The Taiwanese are all very interested. I've been over those- these countries a number of times to press this project. But we've made more project- we've made more progress on this project with the Trump administration than we ever have. So I'm very bullish on this. And by the way, this will be a game changer, hugely strategic for our allies, for our military, for Alaskans. Estimates of this would create about 20,000 jobs. This is a game-changer strategically, and I'm really appreciative the President spent so much time pressing this project, and we've made good progress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you mentioned how furious you were with the Biden administration for the executive actions they said they were taking to protect natural resources. They said land conservation was necessary, and the indigenous population here really wanted it. You called it a lie.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I did call it a lie. It was a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said it was national security suicide. Trump has already reversed this. But are you at all concerned that there are short-term benefits to your state financially, but longer-term real damage to the environment here?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: No. Look, Alaska has an incredible record of being able to develop our resources and protect the environment. You walk around here, you see what a pristine, beautiful environment we have here. We love that more than the Biden administration EPA or President Biden himself did. We love that part of our state. But we know we need jobs, we need natural resource development, so we can do both. And here's the thing I did call the president, President Biden, out for lying because the entire North Slope of Alaska, the Inupiat community across the board, was against what the Biden administration did, which was lock up the entire National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska- which was set aside by Congress to develop our resources. And then he had the audacity to say, hey, I did this on behalf of the native people. That was not true at all. It was a outrage. President Trump has reversed all that. The One Big Beautiful Bill, when we talk about the energy component of that legislation, it's almost all unleashing Alaska. So we're excited right now and- but we have a great record of being able to do both, develop natural resources and protect the environment here, and that's what the people of Alaska want.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So- so for activists, or for those concerned about the damage here, you say they just don't know what they're talking about?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, I say- well, a couple things. A, we have the highest standards on the environment in a place in the world. I used to be the Commissioner of Natural resources and Energy- in charge of that. There's no place on the planet that has higher standards on protecting the environment than us. And if we need American energy, why would we go- like the Biden administration did, begging from Iran, Venezuela, places that have no environmental standards when you can get it from America, from American workers with the highest environmental standards any place on the planet. And secondly- and this is something I really try to emphasize- I emphasized it with Secretary Kennedy when he was in town here a couple of weeks ago. You know, when you have resource development, particularly in our rural communities, you see life expectancies increases- increasing. On the North Slope of Alaska, when we started developing our resources, where most of the resources are, you had Inupiat native populations that had very low life expectancies. In 25 years, they increased their life expectancy by almost 13, 14, 15 years more than any other place in the country during that period, because they got good jobs, because they got hospitals, because they got clinics, because they got flushing toilets and running water. So when we're talking about resource development, it's not just the economy and jobs, it's people living longer in my state, and that's as important as it gets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want to ask you a little bit more about national security, and then talk a little bit more local, if we could. So in this region, the Arctic is of supreme concern from a national security perspective. The ice is melting--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Majority of scientists attribute that to global warming, but the end result is there's a potential for an Arctic area for trade routes--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: --Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --also tapping into the natural resources there. How does the United States gain an edge in dominating that?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, look, it's a great question. It's really important. You're mentioning trade routes that are opening up. We've already talked about natural resources, which are huge up in the Arctic. And what we need to do is recognize that we're an Arctic nation. We're an Arctic nation because of Alaska. And look, this has not always been a priority of previous administrations. When I first got to the Senate, I remember holding up the Biden- or, I'm sorry, the Obama administration Arctic strategy with the Secretary of Defense slamming it down on the dais and saying, Mr. Secretary, this is a joke. We have a huge national interest in the Arctic that we need to protect. It's not some parochial issue for Alaska's senator. This is about national security up here. So it is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --They were trying, I remember back then they were trying for more ice cutters- Icebreakers and all of that--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, it's finally start- well, it's finally starting to happen. What we're doing up here, we're rebuilding our military, the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' certainly does it. As I mentioned, you know, Alaska exudes military might. We're the cornerstone of missile defense, and we're going to be the cornerstone of the President's Golden Dome initiative. We are the hub of air combat power. You're seeing them flying over here. We have over 100 fifth generation fighters based in Alaska. We have a brand new US Army Airborne Division up here. So we are building out our military, which is great, but also building out our Arctic capabilities. Just three days ago, we commissioned finally an Icebreaker in Juneau, Alaska--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw that.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: That's going to be home ported in Alaska. Can you imagine that, Margaret? Putting an Icebreaker where the ice is makes sense, but it's never happened until last Sunday. President Trump and his team have been a huge proponent of this. And again, in the 'One Big \u00a0Beautiful Bill,' one of the untold stories of that bill--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: $9 billion in it for Icebreakers.",
      "SEN. SULIVAN: Well, 20- almost $26 billion investment in the Coast Guard, which is the biggest investment in the Coast Guard in American history, by far. 16 Icebreakers coming with that, 22 cutters, 40 helicopters, a bunch of shore side infrastructure, a lot of that's going to be in Alaska to defend the Arctic. And we need to defend the Arctic, because, as you and I have talked about, the Russians and the Chinese are in our waters and in our airspace all the time, including doing joint operations up here, which is unprecedented.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you about that, because the war in Ukraine has hurt Russia's finances, made them more dependent on Beijing, including when it comes to exploring up and around the Arctic. They had a joint Bomber Task Force.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Correct--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --come here pretty darn close.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Oh, they were in our ADIZ, as they as we call it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Air Defense Identification Zone.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, are you concerned this actually becomes a flashpoint?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I think this is already becoming a flashpoint. I mean the number of times that the Russians and Chinese are doing joint strategic bomber task forces in our airspace and joint naval task forces in our EEZ- in our waters--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --economic zone.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Yes, that's happening on a regular basis now. That's unprecedented. They don't do joint operations anywhere else on America's borders, that's for sure. So again, it's the reason we need to build up, not just our military forces, but our infrastructure. And the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' I got a provision in to start reopening the Adak Navy military base. It was out on the Aleutian island chain. We're going to get a strategic Arctic port built in Nome, Alaska- in western Alaska. So, we need the infrastructure to project power, and we are getting that from this administration- and the Congress. A lot of this is bipartisan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Republican Chair of the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee says there is far more needed for the US military than what has been provided by the White House in their budget.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Again, 150 billion in the One Big, Beautiful Bill, 25 billion for the Coast Guard, which is part of our military. But I want to- you know, I'm someone who is a strong advocate for a strong military, particularly up here. And we need to do more, and we certainly need to keep it above 3% of GDP and growing towards four or 5% of GDP. It's a dangerous world right now, but this One Big, Beautiful Bill, the budget reconciliation bill, does a lot for our military right now. On urgent needs. Ship building, as you and I have talked about, our Navy, our ability to build ships is completely atrophied. Weapons, ammo systems, the Golden Dome. There's a lot in this One Big, Beautiful Bill that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what that is? Have they actually briefed the Senate Armed Services Committee? I know you have your own proposal, but has the Pentagon told you what the Golden Dome is?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Absolutely. Alright. I mean, I've been working on this with the Pentagon. This is missile defense that is a layered missile defense. So what that means is, right here, like I said, you have the ground-based missile interceptor, the missile interceptors in Alaska. You have all the radar systems in Alaska that protect the whole country. In terms of ballistic missiles, we have new threats. We have hypersonics, we have drones. We have, heck, even we've seen it here in Alaska, spy balloons. What we need to do is upgrade the system with what's called a layered defense, not just the ground based system here, but you work it more with different systems, Aegis Ashore, THADD and then including space based systems, both for tracking and intercepting, and you do that with the open architecture in terms of software to integrate those systems. So I am very familiar with what the Golden Dome is doing, and I'm leading the effort in the Senate on it. And by the way, my state is the cornerstone of all the missile defense right now and will continue to be so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm being told that we are running out of time. But I do need to ask you, when you're talking about the big, One, Big, Beautiful Bill, the tax and spending--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: You smile every time you say that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Republican tax and spend bill that just passed, Alaska got a lot of special treatment\u2013",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Alaska did very well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0And your colleague, Senator Lisa Murkowski, acknowledged that, she said the bill wasn't good enough for the rest of the nation. You said you had a dark night of the soul at one point.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Yeah, I did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You almost didn't vote for this.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: No, I had a dark night of soul because I had been working on a provision in that bill--",
      "MARGRET BRENNAN: The Medicaid costs paid for by the federal government--",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: The Medicaid FMAP as we call it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: And that had the support of the White House, support of all the Republicans, something I've been working on for almost 10 years. Alaska gets a very low match in terms of Medicaid, one of the lowest in the country, which I think makes no sense. So this changes the formula to help states like mine that have very high health care costs. So that was in the bill, and Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats literally challenged every single good provision in that bill dealing with Alaska. And I mean every provision. Schumer definitely made himself clear that he was the anti-Alaska senator in the Senate. Everything- we fought him. We beat him back on almost everything. They won. Chuck Schumer stripped out a Medicaid increase for Alaska. It was tough on me, because I've been working on that for a long time. We pivoted. We got the Rural Health Care Transformation fund and increased--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You got exemptions for Alaska Natives for new Medicaid and SNAP or food stamps. Work requirements waived for indigenous people. Alaska gets a larger share of rural hospital funds. Why shouldn't people living in other states get those same considerations?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: Well, we have unique challenges up here. Come on up to Alaska--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or it was a tight vote.",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: It's a\u2013 What's that?",

      "SEN. SULLIVAN: It's called- It's called good legislating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what about the rest of the country? You acknowledge there are flaws?",
      "SEN. SULLIVAN: I'm first and foremost the Senator for Alaska. But I care about the rest of the country too, which is why I focus a lot on energy, a lot on our national security, a lot on border security. I care a lot about the border security in the southern part of America. So you know, all senators do that. They take care of their own state. They legislate to help their constituents. My constituents have unique needs, but we also bring a lot to the table for our great country. Like I said, we're protecting the whole country in terms of missile defense right now, we have a huge military up here that we love, that is protecting our interests in the North Pacific, in the Arctic, and we are unleashing American energy, which, of course, helps Alaska but helps America. When Alaska is doing well on energy issues, on critical mineral issues, that helps my constituents but helps the country. And that's again, why I'm so appreciative of the President and his team on recognizing that. The Biden guys, all they wanted to do was shut us down, close off our state. That didn't help anybody. All that helped was the Russians and the Iranians and the Venezuelans.",

      "The remarkable move \u2014 with one European leader after another announcing that they'll be at Zelenskyy's side when he travels to the White House on Monday \u2014 was an apparent effort to ensure that the meeting goes better than the last one in February, when Trump berated the Ukrainian president in a heated Oval Office encounter.",

      "The European leaders' presence at Zelenskyy's side, demonstrating Europe's support for Ukraine, could potentially help ease concerns in Kyiv and in other European capitals that Ukraine risks being railroaded into a peace deal that Mr. Trump says he wants to broker with Russia.",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Rubio pushed back on the idea that European leaders are joining Zelenskyy in Washington to provide the Ukrainian president with backup to prevent him from accepting a bad deal after the contentious meeting earlier this year.",
      "\"We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff,\" Rubio said. \"They're coming here tomorrow because they're supposed to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.\"",
      "The secretary outlined that after the meeting with Putin, \"we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress \u2014 not a lot of progress \u2014 but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement,\" Rubio added. \"Enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 17, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin with Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who attended those talks in Anchorage. Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Good morning. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin did not give President Trump the ceasefire he sought. And now Putin says the root causes of the conflict have to be resolved in a peace agreement. Isn't the root cause the fact that Russia invaded in the first place?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: \u00a0Well, ultimately, yeah. But I mean, what he means by root causes is this long historical complaints that we've heard repeatedly. This is not a new argument, he's been making this for a long time, and it's the argument that it's Western encroachment. I don't want to get into- it's just so long. But the bottom line is that all of- you know, we're not going to focus on all of that stuff. We're going to focus on this: are they going to stop fighting or not? And what it's going to take to stop the fighting. And what it's going to take to stop the fighting, if we're being honest and serious here, is both sides are going to have to give, and both sides should expect to get something from this. And that's a very difficult thing to do. It's very difficult because Ukraine obviously feels, you know, harmed, and rightfully so, because they were invaded. And the Russian side, because they feel like they got momentum in the battlefield, and frankly, don't care, don't seem to care very much about how many Russian soldiers die in this endeavor. They just churn through it. So I think what the President deserves a lot of credit for is the amount of time and energy that his administration is placing on reaching a peace agreement for a war that's not a war that started under him. It's half, you know, it's on the other side of the world. That said, I mean, it's relevant to us. But there are a lot of other issues he could be focused on. So tomorrow, we'll be meeting with President Zelenskyy. We'll be meeting with European leaders. We just met with Putin. He's dedicated a lot of time and energy because he has made it a priority of his administration to stop or end war- stop wars or prevent them. And right now, this is the biggest war going on in the world. It's the biggest war in Europe since World War Two. We're going to continue to do everything we can to reach an agreement that ends the dying and the killing and the suffering that's going on right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You know this well, how long these kind of diplomatic negotiations often take. President Trump was telling European leaders what was discussed was Putin demanding control of Donetsk, a region in the east that his forces do not fully hold, and the UK estimates that taking that full area could be as long as another four years. Putin also is demanding Russian be an official language in Ukraine, and something regarding Russian Orthodox churches. Did the U.S. accept all of what Putin laid out at that table?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: The United States is not in a position to accept anything or reject anything, because ultimately, it's up to the Ukrainians. They're the ones that Russia has to make peace with, Ukraine with Russia--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 --Well, the President said he did come to some agreement--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --It's up to the Ukrainians to make these conditions. Well, the agreements were that we were going to try to do things like, for example, get a leader- a leaders meeting. We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war. Now, there were some concepts and ideas discussed that we know the Ukrainians could be very supportive of in that meeting. I don't think it's- we're not going to negotiate this in the media. I understand that everybody wants to know what happened. But ultimately, there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs, that are potentials for progress. We'll be discussing that more in depth tomorrow, with our European allies, with the Ukrainians that are coming over. We'll be discussing all of these things, because ultimately, we do need to find areas where we're making progress and try to begin to narrow the gap between the two sides. But there's a reason why this war has been going on for three and a half years, and that is, when it comes to the big issues here, there are still some big differences between both sides. Let's see how much progress we can continue to make. It's- it's- it's not been easy, but it's something the President's made a priority. Peace. And he deserves a lot of credit for that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But ultimately, if- if Vladimir Putin is going to be offered land that he has not seized yet, but negotiates his way into, doesn't this set a dangerous precedent that the United States now accepts this concept that it is okay to seize land by force?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, Putin has already seized land by force, and that, in and of itself, is not a positive precedent. This whole war is a negative precedent--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Are you demanding withdrawal?--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --precedent. Well, again, here's the- in order to have a deal here to end- to reach the end of this conflict, both sides are going to have to make concessions. That's just the facts--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But does that mean accepting--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --in any negotiation--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --where Russian forces are now?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: No, no, but, if- But this is not about acceptance. This is about what Ukraine can accept. And what Russia can accept. They both have to accept it, otherwise there won't be a peace deal. Okay. If there aren't concessions, if one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender. That's called the end of the war through surrender. And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender or anything close to it. So in order for there to be a peace deal, this is just a fact, we may not like it, it may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful, but in order for there to be an end of the war, there are things Russia wants that it cannot get, and there are things Ukraine wants that it's not going to get. Both sides are going to have to give up something in order to get to the table, in order to make this happen. That's- that's just the way it is. And I mean, the sooner we accept that, that's the reality. Now, what those things are is going to be up to both sides. There's no conditions that can be imposed on Ukraine. They're going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too. And so, for example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to have- to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security. That's not an unreasonable request. That's something needs to be worked on. Territories will have to be discussed. It's just a fact, and there are things that maybe Russia is holding now that they're going to have to give up. Who knows? The point is, we need to create a scenario where that becomes possible, and that's why this has been so hard, because neither side, up to now, has been willing to give on some of these things. But we'll see if that's possible. It may not be, but we're going to try, and we're going to do everything we can to try to achieve a peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand you, you can't get into specifics in a public conversation, but we're looking at Russian troops and strikes intensifying. Did you hear anything from Vladimir Putin that indicated he is willing to make a single concession?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, I think there are a couple. I mean, there were- not enough for Ukraine, if not we would be announcing a peace deal this morning, right? But- but certainly, there are some things we notice changes. There are some changes that I think are possible. I think there's some concepts that were discussed that could potentially lead to something. But again, all these things have to be verifiable. We- it isn't real until it's real. I mean, you- one thing is what you say you might be willing to consider, another thing is your willingness to do it. And it always becomes a trade off in all of this. But you talk about the intensifying strikes on the Russian side, yeah, I mean, they're a full-time war machine. I mean, that's what's happening. The Russian economy has basically been turned into a full-time wartime economy. They have a lot of people. It's a big country. It's not just large geographically. It has huge populations. It continues to churn through people. You know, they lost- 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed last month, in July, in this war. That just tells you the price they're willing to pay. Not saying any of this is admirable, I'm saying that this is the reality of the war that we're facing. It's become attrition, in some ways. It's a meat grinder, and they just have more meat to grind.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about the security bit you just mentioned there, because Italy's Prime Minister says that President Trump revived the idea of security guarantees inspired by NATO's Article Five and a collective security clause that would involve the United States. How does that work? Are these U.S. troops? Are these U.S. monitors?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, what we're going to be working on. That's why- that's one of the reasons why, you know, I talked yesterday to all the national security advisors, a bunch of them from the different European countries, or European leaders coming here tomorrow, heads of state coming tomorrow, along with President Zelenskyy, to discuss this in more detail. I mean, the constructs of something like this needs to be built out once it- concept is one thing. The reality, you know, how it's built and how it would work, is another. But those are the kinds of talks that we're going to be having with them, along with some of the other issues that are at play. But, that-that is one of the-if you were to break this thing down, I mean, there are, obviously, there needs to be an agreement on territories and where the lines are going to be drawn. That's not going to be very easy. That's going to be tough. I think there has to be some discussion about security guarantees for Ukraine, because they don't want this war to\u2013none of us want to see this war in the future. They're a sovereign country. They have a right to have security agreements with other countries and security alliances with other countries. And then there's the whole issue of reconstruction\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Including the United States?--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: -- How do you rebuild the country? Well, potentially, like I said, that's what we're going to be having a conversation about, and that's what we're going to be meeting. That's why they're all coming here tomorrow, and-and that's why we've been talking on the phone for the last 48 hours with them, and even leading up to it throughout the week there were various meetings just to sort of build out some of these ideas. So all of these right now are ideas, they are concepts that require some more specificity. We'll need to work with our partners to see what that looks like. And I think that's an area where potential progress is real, but that alone won't be enough. There's a bunch of other things that have to be worked through here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN\u00a0 Yea, well, Russia claims it has rescued 700,000 children. I know you know that the warrant out for Vladimir Putin's arrest is for the state-sponsored abduction of kids. I've seen estimates there are something like 30,000 Ukrainian children who have been abducted. Is the United States demanding, or at least, even just as a statement of goodwill here, that Russia return these children?",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Yeah, I mean, we've repeatedly raised that issue on- in every forum possible, and those have also been, by the way, topics of discussion, not just in our meetings with the Ukrainians, but in the negotiations and talks that were going on between Ukraine and Russia at the technical level. These talks were going on in Turkey, as an example. Turkey over the last few months--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah, nothing so far from the Russians --",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --that's been a topic of discussion as well --",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Well, it's unfortunate. Children should be returned to their families. We- on that position, I don't think there's any ambiguity on our side. And they shouldn't even be, you know, a bargaining chip in regards to a broader negotiation. But it's just one more element of how tragic this war is. After three and a half years, this war is getting worse. It's not getting better. You've made the point about the uptick in strikes. This is a war. It's going to get worse. It's not going to get better, and that's why the President is investing so much time in bringing this to an end. And, by the way, everyone is begging us to be involved in this. The Europeans want us involved. The Ukrainians want us involved. Obviously, the Russians want us involved because the President is the only leader in the world- if this is possible, he's the only one that can help make it happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, he's got the leverage over Vladimir Putin if he wanted to crush his economy or at least do more damage to it, but you have held off on those secondary sanctions. President Trump told Fox News his advice to President Zelenskyy is make a deal, Russia's a very big power and they're not. You know there is concern from the Europeans that President Zelenskyy is going to be bullied into signing something away. That's why you have these European leaders coming as back up tomorrow. Can you reassure them?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 No, it isn't. That's not why they're coming as back- that's not true. No but that's not, why, that's not true. They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming- in fact --",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well that February Oval Office meeting in front of television cameras, where President Zelenskyy was dressed down --",
      "SEC. RUBIO: -- Do you know how many meetings we've had since then?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, no, I know. And I was just up in Alaska --",
      "SEC. RUBIO: Yeah, but we've had a bunch of meetings since then.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- watching the one with Vladimir Putin where a red carpet was rolled out for the Russian leader. It was very different--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: -- No, but it wasn't Zelenskyy. We've had more meetings, we've had, we've had, we've had one meeting with Putin and like a dozen meetings with Zelenskyy. So that, but that's not true. They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're coming here tomorrow because we've been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. There were meetings in the UK over the following, the previous weekend --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And they said the President Trump was going to demand a ceasefire --",
      "SEC. RUBIO: -- The President's talked to these leaders as early as Thursday. No, no, but you said that they're coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming here tomorrow- this is such a stupid media narrative that they're coming here tomorrow because the- Trump is going to bully Zelenskyy into a bad deal. We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff. They're coming here tomorrow because they chose to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. We invited them to come. The President invited them to come.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President told those European leaders last week that he wanted a cease fire. The President went on television, said he would walk out of the meeting if Vladimir Putin didn't agree with him. He said there would be severe consequences if he didn't agree to one. He said he'd walk out in two minutes. He spent three hours talking to Vladimir Putin, and he did not get one,so--",
      "SEC. RUBIO: --Because obviously something, things happen during that meeting, well, because obviously things,look our goal here is not to stage some production for the world to say, oh how dramatic he walked out. Our goal here is to have a peace agreement to end this war. Okay? And obviously we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress, not a lot of progress, but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase. If not, we wouldn't be having Zelenskyy flying all the way over here. We wouldn't be having all the Europeans coming all the way over here. Now understand, and take with a grain of salt, I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this. You talk about the sanctions. Look, at the end of the day, if peace is not going to be possible here, and this is just going to continue on as a war, people will continue to die by the thousands, the President has that option to then come in and impose new sanctions. But if he did this now, the moment the President puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks. You've basically locked in at least another year to year and a half of war and death and destruction. We may unfortunately wind up there, but we don't want to wind up there. We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here. We're going to do everything possible to make that happen if it's doable. It will require both sides to make concessions. It will require both sides to get things they're asking for. That's how these deals are made, whether we like it or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Before I let you go, quickly, why did the State Department just announced that they're halting visitor visas for all Gazans coming here for medical aid? Why would some of these kids, for example, who are coming to hospitals for treatment be a threat?",
      "SEC. RUBIO:\u00a0 Well, first of all, it's not just kids, it's a bunch of adults that are accompanying them. Second, we had outreach from multiple congressional offices asking questions about it, and so we're going to reevaluate how those visas are being granted, not just to the children, but how those visas are being granted to the people who are accompanying them. And by the way, to some of the organizations that are facilitating it. There is evidence, it's been presented to us by numerous congressional offices, that some of the organizations bragging about and involved in acquiring these visas have strong links to terrorist groups like Hamas. And so we are not going to be in partnership with groups that are friendly with Hamas. So we need to- we're going to pause those visas. There was just a small number of them issued to children, but they come with adults accompanying them, obviously, and we are going to pause this program and reevaluate how those visas are being vetted and what relationship, if any, has there been by these organizations to the- to the process of acquiring those visas. We're not going to be in partnership with groups that have links or sympathies towards Hamas.",

      "Republican West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Saturday that he was sending a contingent of 300 to 400 Guard troops to Washington, while Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster authorized the deployment of 200 of his state's National Guardsmen and Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said his state would send 150 military police at the request of the Defense Department.",

      "Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican from Vermont, declined on Friday to send the state's National Guard troops to the nation's capital. Scott's chief of staff, Jason Gibbs, told Vermont Public that while public safety is a \"legitimate concern\" in cities across the country, \"the governor just does not support utilizing the guard for this purpose, and does not view the enforcement of domestic law as proper use of the National Guard.\"",

      "By adding outside troops to join the existing National Guard deployment and federal law enforcement officers temporarily assigned to Washington, Mr. Trump is exercising even tighter control over the city. It's a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though district officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump's first term in office.",
      "A White House official\u00a0told CBS News Saturday that National Guard members deployed to D.C. \"may be armed,\" but that they would not make arrests. This was a reversal from earlier in the week, when a Defense Department official told CBS News that deployed Guard members would not be armed at the request of local law enforcement partners. The official also said at the time they would not have weapons in their vehicles.",

Mr. Trump said the meeting with Putin \"went very well.\" He also said the meeting was followed by a \"late night phone call\" with Zelenskyy and other European leaders, including Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO. The call took place around 2:40 a.m. ET.",
      "\"It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump did not share any details of the agreement. Diplomatic sources told CBS News that Mr. Trump said that Putin would make some concessions, but failed to specify what that might mean.",
      "In his first remarks since Friday's summit, Putin said the visit to Alaska was \"timely and very useful\" and that addressing the \"root causes\" of the war \"should be the basis of a settlement.\"",
      "\"We have not had direct negotiations of this kind at this level for a long time. I repeat: there was an opportunity calmly, in detail once again to express our position,\" Putin said, according to a transcript of a meeting with senior Russian officials released by Kremlin. \"We, of course, respect the position of the U.S. administration, which sees a need for an early cessation of hostilities. Well, we would also like to resolve all issues by peaceful means. The conversation was very frank, informative, and I think it brings us closer to the right decisions.\"",
      "European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, said in a statement that they had been debriefed on the meeting with Putin, and said Mr. Trump had supported security guarantees for Ukraine. The guarantees would allow Ukraine to \"effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" the statement said.",
      "Diplomatic sources told CBS that European leaders were relieved to hear President Trump offer a U.S. security guarantee, but described the idea as vague, and it's unclear how it would work.",
      "Mr. Trump said Zelenskyy would join him in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon to discuss the proposal.",
      "Zelenskyy has previously supported a ceasefire agreement to meet and discuss a peace agreement, but Moscow has rejected the idea. He has also criticized any talks that take place without Ukraine.",
      "\"If it all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Potentially, millions of people's lives will be saved.\"",
      "First Lady Melania Trump on Friday also\u00a0wrote a letter to Putin, saying he can \"singlehandedly restore\" children's laughter. Attorney General Pam Bondi posted the letter on social media Saturday.",
      "\"In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone \u2014 you serve humanity itself,\" the letter said, in part. \"Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr. Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today. It is time.\"",
      "Zelenskyy previously joined Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance in the Oval Office in March, but the gathering quickly descended into insults and chaos.",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with Putin in Anchorage on Friday ended without a ceasefire or peace deal. In brief remarks after the leaders' nearly three-hour meeting, Putin alluded to \"unspecified agreements,\" but no further details were given. Mr. Trump said the meeting had been \"extremely productive.\" Neither leader mentioned an end to the fighting in Ukraine.",
      "The summit, which included a red carpet and military flyover, ended early without a planned luncheon between a broader group of officials. Mr. Trump returned to Washington, D.C. overnight.",
      "In a taped conversation with Fox News' Sean Hannity before he departed from Alaska, Mr. Trump said he believes Putin wants the war to end and that the nations are close to a deal, and added that it's \"really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done.\" He did not specify what an agreement might look like.",
      "Zelenskyy has said in the past that he will never agree to any formal Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory or abandon the country's bid for NATO membership. Meanwhile, Putin has been\u00a0unwavering in his demand to keep all Ukrainian territory that his forces occupy and prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, with the long-term goal of returning it to Moscow's sphere of influence.",
      "Diplomatic sources expressed concern to CBS that Mr. Trump had dropped his ceasefire demand and feared that the U.S. president and Putin may have come to an agreement on deal terms that they may try to force on Ukraine. The sources said that European leaders are trying to show unity with Zelenskyy to push back.",
      "Mr. Trump has called ending the war in Ukraine and Russia a top priority for his administration. He previously said he would end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office in January. He has criticized both Putin and Zelenskyy for failing to end the conflict. In recent months, he has appeared to become frustrated with Putin,\u00a0giving several ultimatums and criticizing the Russian leader for the violence against civilians in Ukraine amid ongoing conversations with the U.S.",
      "\"I always hang up, [and] say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call,'\" Mr. Trump said in July. \"And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city, and I say, 'That's strange.' And after that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Friday that he would not enact economic sanctions he had\u00a0threatened against Russia if an agreement wasn't reached by early August. He said he \"may have to think about\" enacting the sanctions \"in two weeks or three weeks or something.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services instructed officers on Friday to consider additional factors when determining whether immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship have a \"good moral character.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is signaling it will more heavily scrutinize applications filed by legal immigrants seeking American citizenship, in its latest effort to tighten access to U.S. immigration benefits.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency overseeing the country's legal immigration system, instructed officers on Friday to consider additional factors when determining whether immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship have a \"good moral character.\"",
      "Typically, legal immigrants with U.S. permanent residency, also known as a green card, can apply for naturalized American citizenship after a 3- or 5-year period, depending on their case. Demonstrating \"a good moral character\" has long been one of the requirements in U.S. immigration law for American citizenship, alongside passing English and civics tests.",
      "For decades, under Republican and Democratic administrations, the \"good moral character\" assessment has generally been satisfied if applicants don't have any of the criminal offenses or disqualifying conduct outlined in U.S. immigration law. Those disqualifying factors range from violent crimes like murder and aggravated felonies to drug offenses and being a \"habitual drunkard.\"",
      "But a policy issued Friday by USCIS expands the \"good moral character\" assessment, saying that determination must involve \"more than a cursory mechanical review focused on the absence of wrongdoing.\" Instead, the review, the agency told its officers, should be \"a holistic assessment of an alien's behavior, adherence to societal norms, and positive contributions that affirmatively demonstrate good moral character.\"",
      "The directive orders officers to place a \"greater emphasis\" on applicants' \"positive attributes and contributions,\" listing community involvement, family caregiving and ties, educational attainment, \"stable and lawful\" employment, the length of time spent in the U.S., and paying taxes as some of those factors.",
      "The memo also mandates \"greater scrutiny\" of factors that show applicants lack a \"good moral character,\" beyond the crimes and disqualifying conduct detailed in U.S. immigration law.",
      "Those factors, the policy said, include \"acts that are contrary to the average behavior of citizens in the jurisdiction where aliens reside,\" including actions that are \"technically lawful\" but also \"inconsistent with civic responsibility within the community.\" USCIS listed \"reckless or habitual traffic infractions, or harassment or aggressive solicitation\" as some of those actions.",
      "Lastly, the new USCIS policy instructs officers to weigh factors that could show that applicants who have engaged in wrongdoing have rehabilitated, such as complying with probation, paying overdue taxes or child support and receiving letters of support from their community.",
      "Over the past decade, the U.S. government has naturalized between 600,000 and 1 million immigrants as citizens annually, USCIS figures show.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, USCIS chief spokesman Matthew Tragesser said the directive is another effort by President Trump's administration to \"restore integrity\" to the U.S. immigration system.",
      "\"U.S. citizenship is the gold standard of citizenship \u2014 it should only be offered to the world's best of the best,\" Tragesser added. \"Today, USCIS is adding a new element to the naturalization process that ensures America's newest citizens not only embrace America's culture, history, and language but who also demonstrate Good Moral Character.\"",
      "Doug Rand, a former senior USCIS official during the Biden administration, suggested the Trump administration's policy is designed to scare legal immigrants from applying for American citizenship and require officers to put their \"thumb on the scale\" to find more reasons to deny applications.",
      "\"They're trying to increase the grounds for denial of U.S. citizenship by kind of torturing the definition of good moral character to encompass extremely harmless behavior,\" Rand said, citing the policy's reference to traffic infractions.",
      "While the Trump administration has launched a highly visible crackdown on illegal immigration by deploying thousands of troops to the southern border, expanding immigration raids across the country, and fast-tracking deportations of those in the U.S. illegally, it has simultaneously moved to restrict legal immigration, with less fanfare.",
      "The Trump administration has virtually shut down refugee admissions, terminated Biden-era programs that allowed migrants to enter the U.S. legally, limited visas for certain countries and implemented aggressive vetting procedures for legal immigration benefits. Those efforts include expanded vetting of social media activity of legal immigrants and stricter screening requirements for some applications.",

    "story": [
      "Democrats unveiled a proposal Friday that could give California's dominant political party an additional five U.S. House seats in a bid to win the fight to control Congress next year.",
      "The plan calls for an unusually timed reshaping of House district lines to greatly strengthen the Democratic advantage in the state ahead of midterm elections, when Republicans will be defending the party's fragile House majority.",
      "It amounts to a counterpunch to the Texas Republicans' plan to take five Democratically held seats and redraw them to favor the GOP at the urging of President Trump as he tries to avoid losing control of Congress and, with it, prospects for his conservative agenda in the later part of his term.",
      "The California effort seeks to take five of the state's nine GOP districts and make them more favorable to Democrats. Just like in Texas, however, it is by no means a guarantee that Democrats would win all five of these seats if a new California map becomes law.",
      "Making the shift would likely require an amendment to California's state Constitution. Overhauling the current map that is in law would need to be passed by a two-thirds vote in both the state Assembly and state Senate, and then be approved by California voters in an election.",
      "California lawmakers are scheduled to return to Sacramento on Aug. 18 amid the redistricting talk. The California State Legislature will have a short time span to move forward.",
      "If approved by voters in a special election this November, the California blueprint could nearly erase Republican House members in the nation's most populous state. The Democratic plan is intended to win the party 48 of its 52 U.S. House seats, up from 43 currently.",
      "The proposal was released by the campaign arm of House Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Democrats in the state Legislature will hold hearings and plan to vote on the new maps next week.",
      "\"This is about more than drawing lines on a map. It's about drawing a line in the sand to stop Texas and Trump from rigging the election,\" state Senate Democratic leader Mike McGuire said in a statement.",
      "New districts have boundaries to boost Democratic edge",
      "While a general notion behind drawing districts is to unite what's called communities of interest \u2014 neighborhoods and cities that share similar concerns or demographic traits \u2014 the proposed remapping would create a jigsaw of oddly shaped districts to maximize Democratic clout.",
      "The 1st Congressional District is currently anchored in the state's conservative far northeast corner and is represented by Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Trump supporter. The district has a nearly 18-point GOP registration edge.",
      "Under the proposal, Democrats would end up with a 10-point registration advantage in the district after drastic reshaping to include parts of heavily Democratic Sonoma County near the Pacific Coast.",
      "In a post on the social platform X, LaMalfa called the proposal \"absolutely ridiculous.\" LaMalfa's first congressional district would include parts of Santa Rosa under the proposed maps, an area that is in Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson's district.",
      "In the battleground 41st District east of Los Angeles, represented by long-serving Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, Democratic and Republican registration is currently split about evenly.",
      "But in the redrawn district, Democratic registration would jump to 46%, with GOP registration falling to 26%.",
      "Other Republicans whose districts would see major changes intended to favor Democrats include Rep. Kevin Kiley in Northern California, Rep. Ken Calvert in Riverside County, Rep. David Valadao in the Central Valley farm belt and Rep. Darrell Issa in San Diego County. Also, embattled Democratic incumbents would see their districts padded with additional left-leaning voters.",
      "\"Well, obviously, Newsom's entire goal was to revert to the era of drawing lines based upon partisan political factors, as politicians draw their lines,\" Kiley told CBS Sacramento earlier Friday.",
      "Kiley's current district covers suburbs, small towns and mountain communities from the Sacramento region to the Eastern California border.",
      "The release of the plan came the same day that Texas Republicans began a second special session to approve new congressional maps sought by Trump.",
      "The GOP's first special session in Texas ended without approving new political maps, thwarted by Democrats who staged a nearly two-week walkout that meant not enough lawmakers were present to pass any legislation. Gov. Greg Abbott then quickly called a second session that started without the necessary quorum to conduct business.",
      "Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that his state will hold a Nov. 4 special referendum on the redrawn districts.",
      "\"We can't stand back and watch this democracy disappear district by district all across the country,\" Newsom said.",
      "The announcement marked the first time any state beyond Texas officially waded into Trump's fight, though several governors and legislative leaders from both parties have threatened such moves.",
      "Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, who heads the House GOP campaign arm, said Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, is \"shredding California's Constitution and disenfranchising voters.\"",
      "\"Californians oppose Newsom's stunt because they won't let a self-serving politician rig the system to further his career,\" said Hudson, who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee.",
      "How will voters react?",
      "Under current law, California has an independent redistricting commission that was approved by voters earlier this century. Newsom has emphasized that the ballot effort would not get rid of the commission, though it would essentially suspend it. If the measure passes, the commission would then resume being able to write maps after the 2030 census.",
      "A big risk for Democrats is whether voters will be open to setting aside district boundaries crafted by the independent commission for ones shaped for partisan advantage.",
      "Some people already have said they would sue over the effort. Republican former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a longtime opponent of partisan redistricting, signaled that he will not side with Democrats even after talking to Newsom. He posted a photo of himself Friday at the gym wearing a T-shirt that said, \"Terminate gerrymandering,\" with a reference to an obscenity and politicians.",
      "\"I'm getting ready for the gerrymandering battle,\" Schwarzenegger said.",
      "House control could come down to a few seats in 2026",
      "On a national level, the partisan makeup of existing district lines puts Democrats within three seats of a majority. Of the 435 total seats, only several dozen districts are competitive. So even slight changes in a few states could affect which party wins control.",
      "New maps are typically drawn once a decade after the census \u2014 the last being in 2020. Many states, including Texas, give legislators the power to draw maps. California is among those that empowers independent commissions with the task.",
      "If approved, a new California map would take effect only if a Republican state does its own redistricting. It would remain through the 2030 elections. After that, Democrats say, they would return mapmaking power to the independent commission voters approved in 2008.",

      "Clinton added: \"I'm dreaming that for whatever combination of reasons, including the elusive Nobel Peace Prize, President Trump may actually stand up to Putin on behalf of not just Ukraine and its democracy and its very brave people, but frankly, on behalf of our own security and interests.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr and the Ukrainians want a full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, including the territories Russia has seized.",
      "Mr. Trump, whose supporters chanted \"lock her up\" about Clinton during the 2016 presidential election, expressed appreciation for his formal rival's remarks. The president told Fox News' Bret Baier on Friday it was \"very nice\" of Clinton to say that, and, \"I may have to start liking her again.\"",
      "Clinton on Friday said she hopes Mr. Trump remembers that he's at the very military base \"that has to send up fighter planes to watch and fend off Russian bombers that routinely harass our military assets, do overflights, engage in provocative behavior in the skies above Alaska.\"",
      "\"I hope he's reminded of that,\" she continued. \"He is not meeting with a friend. He is meeting with an adversary, and an adversary who hopes to play him. And the best thing that could come out of this, frankly, is probably nothing, nothing agreed to, except a real strengthening of President Trump's understanding that Putin is not someone you can make a deal with an expect it to last.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Aug 2025 17:16:53 -0400",
    "summary": "Environmental groups and independent scientists are criticizing a report assembled by a small team of well-known climate skeptics selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has reduced funding for climate research, dismissed federal scientists who worked on the National Climate Assessment, and removed past editions of the report from government websites. Now, critics say, it is taking the next step: rewriting the science itself, according to a lawsuit filed this week by environmental groups.",
      "As the Environmental Protection Agency moves to revoke the Endangerment Finding, the 2009 scientific determination that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, the Department of Energy published a\u00a0new review of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on U.S. climate that aims to support the EPA's efforts.",
      "The report was developed this spring by the 2025 Climate Working Group, which is composed of five independent climate scientists selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.",
      "But environmental groups and independent scientists have criticized the report and how it was written, claiming it was assembled in secret by the five scientists who are recognized by the larger scientific community as climate skeptics.",
      "\"The secret report was produced by a set of known climate contrarians who were commissioned to write this report that's full of inaccuracies,\" said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director of climate and energy programs at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"It's clearly geared towards trying to give the EPA a way to evade its legal responsibility to address the health harms of heat trapping emissions and climate change.\"",
      "A \"secret report\"",
      "The DOE report, entitled \"A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,\" was commissioned in March when Wright assembled the group to undertake a massive review of scientific findings in a very short period of time, with no public announcement of this effort.",
      "The five authors delivered their final draft by May 28. In the report's preface, the authors wrote, \"The short timeline and the technical nature of the material meant that we could not comprehensively review all topics.\"",
      "Their report argues that carbon-driven warming may be less economically damaging than commonly believed, and that aggressive U.S. climate policies would have little measurable impact on the global climate. It attributes some warming to natural climate cycles or changes in the sun, instead of the burning of fossil fuels, and also claims sea level rise has not been accelerating, contrary to widely accepted scientific evidence. Finally, it highlights the potential benefits of rising carbon dioxide levels for plant growth.",
      "\"I would say that it presents an incomplete and misleading picture of how climate change is affecting the United States,\" said Phil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, who previously worked in the Biden and Obama administrations as a science policy expert.",
      "Duffy and other scientists say the DOE report cherry-picks evidence, misrepresents peer-reviewed research, and ignores the overwhelming consensus that human activity is driving dangerous warming. Numerous climate-based groups and researchers have published their own fact-checks on the report, with one listing more than 100 false or misleading claims made by the authors.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Department of Energy about the criticisms of the report. They responded by referring to Wright's statement in the preface, where he wrote that he chose the panel \"for their rigor, honesty, and willingness to elevate the debate.\"",
      "\"This DOE report is in service of a political goal, it's not credible science,\" said Ben Santer, a climate researcher and board member of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Santer says his own published work was misrepresented in the DOE report and said the authors \"fundamentally twist\" the work of many researchers to reach conclusions that \"will be used for a political purpose.\"",
      "Critics in the scientific community have pointed out that the panel's five authors are known for their contrarian views on climate science, which are often at odds with the scientific consensus on the causes of climate change.",
      "\"The people that were handpicked by the Trump administration's energy secretary are this very small group of people who are known to disagree with that mountain of [scientific] evidence,\" said Vickie Patton, general counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund. \"Some of them have connections to the fossil fuel industry.\"",
      "Accusations of rewriting science",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas executive, has been vocal about his views on climate change, which align with the report's findings. In an op-ed earlier this year, he called climate change \"a by-product of progress,\" and wrote, \"I am willing to take the modest negative trade-off for this legacy of human advancement.\" He argues that while climate change is real, it is not the greatest threat, and that expanding access to affordable, reliable energy should remain the priority.",
      "Wright has been transparent about how he views U.S. climate research, telling CNN's Kaitlan Collins that the administration is reviewing past federal climate reports, including the National Climate Assessment, and may provide \"updates\" later this year, leading many in the scientific community to fear the administration is aiming to edit or censor critical research.",
      "\"It's important that science be allowed to speak for itself and I do have concerns that that's not happening,\" Duffy told CBS News.",
      "National Climate Assessments typically take years to write and are authored by hundreds of scientists.",
      "Duffy says that Wright didn't oversee the previous reports and therefore has no authority to review or revise them. \"He can't rewrite the National Climate Assessment any more than I can rewrite 'The Great Gatsby,'\" Duffy says.",
      "The Environmental Defense Fund and Union of Concerned Scientists filed a lawsuit Tuesday in federal court against the EPA and the Department of Energy, arguing that their actions violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires transparency and balanced membership for government advisory panels. The suit alleges that the Climate Working Group was created in secret, its work withheld from the public, and then its report was used extensively by the EPA, cited 22 times, to justify repealing the Endangerment Finding. The organizations are asking a judge to block the government's use of the report to comply with transparency laws.",
      "When asked about the lawsuit, the EPA responded in an email saying, \"As a matter of longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on current or pending litigation,\" and referred CBS News to the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy did not respond to any of our requests for comment.",

    "summary": "Federal funding cuts to mRNA technology research doesn't just impact COVID vaccines \u2014 experts say it could stall progress in treatment for cancers, rare disease and more.",
    "story": [
      "If you think last week's decision by the federal government to halt $500 million in funding\u00a0for vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology will only affect COVID vaccines, think again.",
      "These types of vaccines\u00a0use\u00a0messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce an antibody response to protect against a pathogen. The science behind it is also being studied for a wide range of other uses, from fighting cancer to treating autoimmune conditions and more.",
      "Health experts have criticized the move to defund this research, pointing to the impact it will have on America's ability to develop breakthroughs against deadly or debilitating diseases.",
      "Jeff Coller, professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University, called the cuts a \"completely reckless decision from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\" that was \"clearly being made for political motivations and not those that are rested in our science.\"",
      "Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who served in the first Trump administration, said the technology \"helps us develop vaccines and new treatments,\" and warned that cuts could halt progress in one of the \"most promising areas of modern medicine.\"",
      "\"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology,\" Adams said in a recent appearance on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "mRNA studied for pancreatic cancer, rare diseases and more",
      "Collier said one of the most exciting avenues for mRNA technology is in the treatment of deadly cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which is fatal for many patients within six months to a year.",
      "In recent years, researchers have been testing the effectiveness of using an mRNA vaccine to target the cancer. A small NIH-funded clinical trial by Sloan Kettering in 2023 used infusions of an mRNA vaccine to help boost T cells in the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients. The results, published in the journal\u00a0Nature, showed improvements among about 50% of participants.",
      "\"It was, in essence, the start of a cure for pancreatic cancer, where half of the patients in that study were surviving,\" Coller said.",
      "The early results encouraged scientists, but the small sample size called for further studies, which led to a\u00a0Phase 2 trial published in Nature earlier this year.",
      "Experimental mRNA-focused treatments have also showed promise in fighting lung,\u00a0colorectal and gastric cancers. For example, a study published online in the journal Gastric Cancer\u00a0found a mRNA-based vaccine led to robust gastric tumor regression in mice.",
      "And earlier this year, the world was was awed by news that an infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using a technique known as CRISPR to fix a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder.",
      "As Coller pointed out, the CRISPR technology had to be delivered via mRNA.",
      "\"This opens a floodgate for rare diseases,\" he said. \"We're now talking about, could we use the same technology to go after all rare diseases?\"",
      "Autoimmune diseases are another area of research, for treating things like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.",
      "While all of these are still at the early research stage, Coller urged the importance of investing in this technology now for future progress.",
      "\"We need to do experiments and see where we can get with the next generation of mRNA-based drugs,\" he said.",
      "Like with COVID-19, there has also been continued research on mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu, RSV, Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, an infection that can be harmful to babies exposed during the mother's pregnancy.",
      "\"We're at a point where, if we continue to develop this technology, we'll get more personalized, bespoke medicine that we can use on patients and improve health care outcomes,\" Coller said.",
      "How is mRNA medicine so versatile?",
      "RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, an essential molecule in the body's cells. It is similar to DNA but has different functions. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries the information required for making proteins.",
      "As Coller put it: \"If your DNA is a cookbook, your mRNA is an individual recipe that's telling your body what to do.\"",
      "To harness that power for treating disease, \"All we're doing with this technology is giving it new recipes. We're taking advantage of this powerful natural system that exists in your body,\" he said.",
      "The versatility and potential to help such a range of illnesses is what has experts like Coller \u2014 who was not immediately impacted by the funding cuts \u2014 hoping the administration will reinstate funding for mRNA research.",

      "The Army has activated the D.C. National Guard to \"assist law enforcement in the nation's capital,\" it said in a statement and added that of the approximately 800 soldiers activated, 100 to 200 would be supporting law enforcement at any given time on an \"array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Trump administration's deployment of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops in the District.",
      "What is the National Guard doing in D.C.?",
      "The District of Columbia is unique in that it's controlled by the federal government, which means the president has authority over the D.C. National Guard.",
      "For now, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Guard members will be supporting federal agents, as they recently did in Los Angeles, when they were brought in after protests against Trump administration immigration policies to help protect federal property and personnel enforcing the policies.",
      "The National Guard this week was activated under Title 32, which concerns the role of the Guard when it is under the control of its state's governor, or in this case, the president. D.C. Guard members have the authority to make arrests while they're in this status, but defense officials say that for now, the mission is focused on supporting law enforcement.",
      "Hegseth said the Guard was formally mobilized Monday morning and would be \"flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\" Asked by Fox News' Laura Ingraham later that day whether the Guard troops would be detaining American citizens on U.S. soil, Hegseth replied, \"Under Title 32, which is the authorization they'll be using, they have broad latitude. But they're not going to be involved in law enforcement functions.\"",
      "He elaborated on how they might be utilized, saying, \"You can help somebody, interdict, temporarily detain like we did in Los Angeles, and hand over to law enforcement.\"",
      "And Hegseth also said the Guard members in D.C. are \"going to be proactive.\"",
      "\"If you take an action or a shot at them, there will be a consequence,\" he told Ingraham.",
      "The Army on Tuesday posted photos of the National Guard near the Washington Monument on X with the comment, \"D.C. National Guard reporting for duty.\"\u00a0Some of the vehicles\u00a0appeared to belong to the D.C. National Guard's 273rd Military Police Company, which often helps with security for high-profile D.C. events like presidential inaugurations and Independence Day celebrations, the unit's website says.",
      "The Guard troops while in Title 32 status are not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the U.S. military from carrying out domestic law enforcement actions.",
      "Members of the D.C. Guard deployed in Title 32 status in 2020, in response to protests over the killing of George Floyd, when the D.C. government requested additional manpower. They also deployed in Title 32 status in response to the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol, after some delay.",
      "There isn't an end date for how long they can stay deployed this time. According to the executive order the president signed Monday, the deployment \"shall remain in effect\" until the president determines the \"conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia.\"",
      "Before they're sent to the D.C. streets, the service members will receive additional training on de-escalation tactics and rules for the use of force, according to defense officials.",
      "Hegseth said Monday at the White House that other guardsmen from other states and other \"specialized units\" are prepared to deploy to D.C. if needed.",
      "What is the president authorized to do with control of the D.C. police?",
      "The Home Rule Act of 1973 created D.C.'s elected government and framework for its interaction with the federal government.",
      "Section 740 of the law says \"whenever the president of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for federal purposes, he may direct the mayor to provide him, and the mayor shall provide, such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the president may deem necessary and appropriate.\"",
      "Under the president's order, Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole is in charge of the daily D.C. Police operations, under the oversight of Attorney General Pam Bondi and Mr. Trump, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Cole has also been directed to work with D.C. police chief Pamela Smith.",
      "The law gives the president 48 hours to notify congressional leaders about his action, which Mr. Trump did on Monday. The president may remain in control of the D.C. police for up to 30 days, unless the House and Senate enact a joint resolution authorizing an extension.",
      "Leavitt said the deployment would be reassessed at the end of the 30-day period.",
      "The D.C. Police Department, which includes roughly 3,100 officers, has over 800 vacancies, according to the D.C. Police Union. The union, which is highly critical of D.C.'s mayor and city council, supports the federal takeover of the force.",
      "Who are the other federal law enforcement officials deployed to the streets of D.C.?",
      "Overnight Monday, about 850 officers and federal agents sent across the city made 23 arrests and seized six illegal handguns off the streets, Leavitt said Tuesday. The suspected offenses included homicide, firearms offenses, reckless driving, and driving under the influence, she said.",
      "\"This is only the beginning,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Participating members of what the White House is calling the Task Force's Law Enforcement Working Group throughout the operation include the U.S. Capitol Police, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Protective Service, the DEA, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Secret Service, and the U.S. Marshals Service. The White House generally isn't specifying which law enforcement entities are performing what responsibilities.",
      "Homeless people being relocated",
      "Leavitt said that the U.S. Park Police would continue to move homeless people off D.C. streets and suggested homeless shelters and mental health and addiction treatment centers are places they can go \u2014 or jail if they refuse.",
      "Before Mr. Trump's announcement Monday, the White House was already deploying federal law enforcement officers onto D.C. streets as a part of an effort to make the city cleaner and safer.",
      "How D.C. officials are responding to the federal takeover",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi met Tuesday with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, along with the FBI director, head of the U.S. Marshals Service, the DEA's Cole and D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro. The attorney general characterized the meeting as \"productive.\"",
      "But Bowser has called the president's takeover of the D.C. police \"unsettling and unprecedented,\" although her criticism of the Trump administration's move has been largely muted.",
      "The White House and Bowser appear to have conflicting ideas about the chain of command for the D.C. police. Bowser on Tuesday said the president has the authority to request services of the police, but \"our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, how we make changes, none of that has changed.\" That view conflicts with Leavitt's statement that\u00a0 Cole would be in charge of the police force, and would be overseen by the president and attorney general.",
      "D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said the D.C. Police already work daily with federal law enforcement, and said she thinks an enhanced presence from the federal government may help.",
      "\"We know that we have to get illegal guns off of our street. And if we have this influx or enhanced presence, it's going to make our city even better,\" Smith said.",
      "\"I won't go into the details of our operational plan at this point, but you will see the Metropolitan Police Department working side by side with our federal partners in order to enforce the efforts that we need around the city,\" Smith said.",

      "During his annual treks to the North Cascades, Pelto has hiked nearly 6,000 miles, and slept 800 nights in a tent. \u00a0\"We got our picture window,\" he said of the view. \"It's also one of those places that's really special to us as a family.\"",
      "His son Ben, daughter Jill, and now his nine-month-old granddaughter Wren have joined him in the field.",
      "Jill Pelto has spent 17 summers by her dad's side, but she doesn't just collect data. As the project's art director, she paints it. The data points that she and her dad measure eventually will go into her art. \"Data is a story about something in the real world and that story has meaning and emotion,\" she said. \"And that's what I'm trying to bring into my art.\"",
      "Her watercolor paintings are more than just beautiful landscapes; they reveal the science. Look closely and you see a bar graph of glacier decline in the North Cascades. One piece showing temperature rise and ice loss made the cover of Time magazine.",
      "Jill said, \"I think sometimes when people see data there's this instant reaction, and so it's not like the data is any different in my art, but something about that combination maybe gets people to kind of put down the wall of like, 'Oh, I can't understand this,' or 'You know, this is not something I'm interested in.'\"",
      "I said, \"The average person is not going to read a scientific report, but they will see a painting. And it does impact you in a different way.\"",
      "\"Yes, definitely,\" said Jill.",
      "Her art has given her dad a new way to share the story he's been recording for the past 42 years. And it's also changed their relationship: \"We do it so seamlessly at this point,\" Mauri said.",
      "\"Feels like you're one team out here?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah,\" he replied.",
      "Jill added, \"This bigger project just means so much to us and has shaped our lives. So, sharing that year after year is beyond special.\"",
      "And now, Mauri Pelto has just eight summers left to fulfill his 50-year promise. Asked what he thinks it will be like to no longer come out to the glaciers, Mauri replied, \"I don't know, I can't remember what it was like to not come out here. This landscape has been shaped by ice, and so to understand the landscape and the ice, you really have to walk across it.\"",

    "story": [
      "If you think last week's decision by the federal government to halt $500 million in funding\u00a0for vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology will only affect COVID vaccines, think again.",
      "These types of vaccines\u00a0use\u00a0messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce an antibody response to protect against a pathogen. The science behind it is also being studied for a wide range of other uses, from fighting cancer to treating autoimmune conditions and more.",
      "Health experts have criticized the move to defund this research, pointing to the impact it will have on America's ability to develop breakthroughs against deadly or debilitating diseases.",
      "Jeff Coller, professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University, called the cuts a \"completely reckless decision from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\" that was \"clearly being made for political motivations and not those that are rested in our science.\"",
      "Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who served in the first Trump administration, said the technology \"helps us develop vaccines and new treatments,\" and warned that cuts could halt progress in one of the \"most promising areas of modern medicine.\"",
      "\"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology,\" Adams said in a recent appearance on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "mRNA studied for pancreatic cancer, rare diseases and more",
      "Collier said one of the most exciting avenues for mRNA technology is in the treatment of deadly cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which is fatal for many patients within six months to a year.",
      "In recent years, researchers have been testing the effectiveness of using an mRNA vaccine to target the cancer. A small NIH-funded clinical trial by Sloan Kettering in 2023 used infusions of an mRNA vaccine to help boost T cells in the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients. The results, published in the journal\u00a0Nature, showed improvements among about 50% of participants.",
      "\"It was, in essence, the start of a cure for pancreatic cancer, where half of the patients in that study were surviving,\" Coller said.",
      "The early results encouraged scientists, but the small sample size called for further studies, which led to a\u00a0Phase 2 trial published in Nature earlier this year.",
      "Experimental mRNA-focused treatments have also showed promise in fighting lung,\u00a0colorectal and gastric cancers. For example, a study published online in the journal Gastric Cancer\u00a0found a mRNA-based vaccine led to robust gastric tumor regression in mice.",
      "And earlier this year, the world was was awed by news that an infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using a technique known as CRISPR to fix a rare and potentially fatal genetic disorder.",
      "As Coller pointed out, the CRISPR technology had to be delivered via mRNA.",
      "\"This opens a floodgate for rare diseases,\" he said. \"We're now talking about, could we use the same technology to go after all rare diseases?\"",
      "Autoimmune diseases are another area of research, for treating things like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.",
      "While all of these are still at the early research stage, Coller urged the importance of investing in this technology now for future progress.",
      "\"We need to do experiments and see where we can get with the next generation of mRNA-based drugs,\" he said.",
      "Like with COVID-19, there has also been continued research on mRNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu, RSV, Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, an infection that can be harmful to babies exposed during the mother's pregnancy.",
      "\"We're at a point where, if we continue to develop this technology, we'll get more personalized, bespoke medicine that we can use on patients and improve health care outcomes,\" Coller said.",
      "How is mRNA medicine so versatile?",
      "RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, an essential molecule in the body's cells. It is similar to DNA but has different functions. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, carries the information required for making proteins.",
      "As Coller put it: \"If your DNA is a cookbook, your mRNA is an individual recipe that's telling your body what to do.\"",
      "To harness that power for treating disease, \"All we're doing with this technology is giving it new recipes. We're taking advantage of this powerful natural system that exists in your body,\" he said.",
      "The versatility and potential to help such a range of illnesses is what has experts like Coller \u2014 who was not immediately impacted by the funding cuts \u2014 hoping the administration will reinstate funding for mRNA research.",
      "\"We have to keep moving forward,\" he said. \"People wanting to improve their family's lives and their children's lives is a bipartisan issue, it's truly an American issue. So we've got to keep moving.\"",

    "story": [
      "United Launch Alliance fired off its first operational Vulcan rocket Tuesday, boosting two military satellites into space in the first U.S. Space Force-sanctioned flight of a new launcher that eventually will replace the company's Atlas 5 and already-retired Deltas.",
      "Equipped with four solid-fuel strap-on boosters for additional takeoff power, the 198-foot-tall Vulcan's two methane-fueled BE-4 engines thundered to life at 8:56 p.m. EDT, instantly propelling the rocket away from pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.",
      "Arcing over the Atlantic Ocean on an easterly trajectory, the Vulcan put on a spectacular sky-lighting show as it roared aloft atop nearly 3 million pounds of thrust and a jet of brilliant exhaust visible for miles around.",
      "The four strap-on boosters were jettisoned about 90 seconds after liftoff, followed three-and-a-half minutes later by burnout and separation of the Vulcan's 109-foot-tall first stage.",
      "The Centaur second stage's two hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C engines ignited and took over from there, but in keeping with standard policy for military missions, ULA ended its launch commentary at that point and the rest of the flight was carried out in secrecy.",
      "At least two satellites were believed to be on board: one fully classified spacecraft and an experimental satellite that will carry out tests of upgraded atomic clocks and navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof Global Positioning System-type data for military and commercial users.",
      "Both satellites were bound for geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit, thus appearing stationary in the sky.",
      "GPS satellites operate in 12,500-mile-high orbits, but Navigation Technology Satellite 3, or NTS-3, will operate from its much higher perch using an advanced phased array antenna that can electronically direct signals to receivers in multiple locations across broad regions.",
      "It is the Pentagon's first experimental navigation satellite since GPS precursors were launched in the 1970s. Along with the NTS-3 satellite, designed and built by L3Harris Technologies, the program includes a ground-based control system and receivers linked by software that enable rapid reprogramming as needed for upgrades or to utilize different signals.",
      "\"GPS is such an integral part of our lives today,\" said Joanna Hinks, a senior aerospace engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. \"You probably all use it in ways that you didn't even realize throughout your morning.",
      "\"And with NTS-3, we are going to be experimenting with a number of different technologies that look at how we can continue to evolve and augment GPS to make sure that it remains the gold standard that our warfighters need.\"",
      "While the major goal of the flight is launching the USSF-106 payloads, the launch marked a major milestone for United Launch Alliance.",
      "It was the third launch of the powerful new Vulcan after two test flights last year and the first to be \"certified\" by the Space Force to carry costly national security spy satellites and other expensive military spacecraft.",
      "\"This mission is headed directly to geosynchronous orbit and will be one of our longest missions to date,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This is the sole purpose of this vehicle. It was purposely designed to support these missions doing direct inject to geo for the Space Force.\"",
      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up. And what that translates to in capability (is) certainly more mass and more accuracy than is easily done by others.\"",
      "While he didn't mention SpaceX or its Falcon Heavy by name, or ULA's retired Delta 4 Heavy, Bruno said \"if you're a typical three-core heavy launch vehicle and ... really derived from a vehicle optimized for that LEO mission, you're going to have to have three cores to get out there, and you're going to have to expend all of them.",
      "\"And here's the really complicated rocket science. You know, one core is cheaper and more efficient than three expendable cores. It's literally that simple.\"",
      "That, coupled with the high-energy Centaur upper stage, gives ULA the capability to launch heavy payloads directly to high orbits without requiring satellites to use their own thrusters \u2014 and limited propellant \u2014 in transit.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Aug 2025 11:00:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The achievement is \"one of those unforgettable peaks that define great human and technological adventures,\" the SolarStratos mission said in a statement.",
    "story": [
      "Swiss pilot Raphael Domjan beat the altitude record for a solar-powered electric plane in a flight that took him soaring to 9,521 meters, or 31,237 feet, his team announced Wednesday.",
      "The SolarStratos plane made the landmark flight from Sion airport in southwest Switzerland on Tuesday, taking advantage of warm air thermals to go beyond the record that has stood for 15 years.",
      "The certified altitude record for a solar plane stands at 9,235 meters, or 30,298 feet.",
      "The achievement is \"one of those unforgettable peaks that define great human and technological adventures,\" the SolarStratos mission said in a statement.",
      "At cruising altitude, Domjan actually crossed paths with a commercial airliner, SolarStratos said, calling the moment \"a powerful symbol of what the decarbonized aviation of tomorrow might look like.\"",
      "Domjan's flight lasted five hours and nine minutes.",
      "\"I share this moment of joy with all the people who have been preparing for this achievement for years,\" the 53-year-old said.",
      "The data will be sent to the World Air Sports Federation governing body, which will decide whether to validate the new record.",
      "\"It is the pressure altitude corrected to standard density altitude that is recognized as the official reference for aviation altitude records,\" the SolarStratos team said.",
      "Domjan \u2014 whose company bio describes him as a \"eco-adventurer\" and lecturer who pilots planes, gliders and helicopters \u2014 is aiming to be the first to take a solar-powered plane above 10,000 meters, flying at the same altitude as airliners. If that barrier is broken, the team hopes to go on and make a first manned solar-powered flight into the stratosphere, which at Switzerland's latitude begins at around 12,000 meters.",
      "\"This achievement marks a major milestone on the path toward reaching the stratosphere using only solar power -- and already fulfils the mission's goal: to capture imaginations with emblematic, spectacular challenges that promote solar energy and the protection of our biosphere and planet,\" SolarStratos said.",
      "The front-mounted single propeller plane, registration HB-SXA, is made of carbon fiber to ensure lightness and strength. SolarStratos is 9.6 meters long, and its huge wingspan of 24.8 meters accommodates the 22 square meters of high-spec solar panels topping the wings, and allows for flying at low speeds.",
      "The plane, which SolarStartos calls \"daring and finely engineered,\"\u00a0can take off at low speeds, from 50 kilometers per hour upwards. Its maximum speed is 140 kph, while its cruising speed is around 80 kph.",
      "\"Tomorrow can be better than what we have today\"",
      "In 2012, the pioneering Domjan became the first person to sail around the world in a fully solar-powered boat, a journey that began in Miami in 2010.",
      "\"It's important to demonstrate what we can achieve with solar energy,\" the adventurer told AFP.",
      "\"The dream of flight is probably the oldest dream of mankind,\" he said.",
      "\"My goal is to show to the young generation of today and tomorrow that tomorrow it will still be possible to fly without burning any fossil energies,\" he said.",
      "\"This is what we want to achieve: it's really to show that the world of tomorrow can be better than what we have today,\" he added.",
      "A warm-up flight on July 31 got to 6,589 meters, surpassing the plane's previous best in 2024.",
      "A first attempt on Friday was quickly abandoned when the forecast thermals failed to materialize, saving the batteries for Sunday when the plane got to 8,224 meters.",
      "During the first phase of record attempts, the aircraft has to make maximum use of rising warm air currents to climb to around 4,000-5,000 meters. It then has to recharge its batteries at this altitude before climbing again.",
      "Before takeoff, the batteries must be fully charged using solar energy, and the plane has to land under its own power \u2014 it cannot glide back in on zero charge \u2014 and have at least 16% charge in the batteries.",
      "If the flight is to be certified as a record, all the energy used during the flight must have been produced by the solar cells. The current record was set in 2010 by the Solar Impulse experimental plane, with Swiss pilot Andre Borschberg at the controls.",

      "According to the company, more than 150 million Americans rely on Amazon, where they've spent $100 billion on groceries and household goods in 2024 alone \u2014 which doesn't include sales from Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh.",
      "\"Overall, this expansion to offer same-day delivery of perishable groceries creates a one-stop shop for an array of customer needs,\" Telsey Advisory Group analysts said in a research note.",
      "They added, \"Importantly, we believe this is a strong move for Amazon, deepening relationships with and share of wallet among its Prime member customers, as well as positioning the company to compete better with other leaders in the grocery space, like Albertsons, Kroger, Target and Walmart.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Aug 2025 21:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "ULA's Vulcan is replacing the company's workhorse Atlas 5 rocket and the already-retired Delta 4 family of launchers.",
    "story": [
      "United Launch Alliance fired off its first operational Vulcan rocket Tuesday, boosting two military satellites into space in the first U.S. Space Force-sanctioned flight of a new launcher that eventually will replace the company's Atlas 5 and already-retired Deltas.",
      "Equipped with four solid-fuel strap-on boosters for additional takeoff power, the 198-foot-tall Vulcan's two methane-fueled BE-4 engines thundered to life at 8:56 p.m. EDT, instantly propelling the rocket away from pad 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.",
      "Arcing over the Atlantic Ocean on an easterly trajectory, the Vulcan put on a spectacular sky-lighting show as it roared aloft atop nearly 3 million pounds of thrust and a jet of brilliant exhaust visible for miles around.",
      "The four strap-on boosters were jettisoned about 90 seconds after liftoff, followed three-and-a-half minutes later by burnout and separation of the Vulcan's 109-foot-tall first stage.",
      "The Centaur second stage's two hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C engines ignited and took over from there, but in keeping with standard policy for military missions, ULA ended its launch commentary at that point and the rest of the flight was carried out in secrecy.",
      "At least two satellites were believed to be on board: one fully classified spacecraft and an experimental satellite that will carry out tests of upgraded atomic clocks and navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof Global Positioning System-type data for military and commercial users.",
      "Both satellites were bound for geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit, thus appearing stationary in the sky.",
      "GPS satellites operate in 12,500-mile-high orbits, but Navigation Technology Satellite 3, or NTS-3, will operate from its much higher perch using an advanced phased array antenna that can electronically direct signals to receivers in multiple locations across broad regions.",
      "It is the Pentagon's first experimental navigation satellite since GPS precursors were launched in the 1970s. Along with the NTS-3 satellite, designed and built by L3Harris Technologies, the program includes a ground-based control system and receivers linked by software that enable rapid reprogramming as needed for upgrades or to utilize different signals.",
      "\"GPS is such an integral part of our lives today,\" said Joanna Hinks, a senior aerospace engineer with the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. \"You probably all use it in ways that you didn't even realize throughout your morning.",
      "\"And with NTS-3, we are going to be experimenting with a number of different technologies that look at how we can continue to evolve and augment GPS to make sure that it remains the gold standard that our warfighters need.\"",
      "While the major goal of the flight is launching the USSF-106 payloads, the launch marked a major milestone for United Launch Alliance.",
      "It was the third launch of the powerful new Vulcan after two test flights last year and the first to be \"certified\" by the Space Force to carry costly national security spy satellites and other expensive military spacecraft.",
      "\"This mission is headed directly to geosynchronous orbit and will be one of our longest missions to date,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This is the sole purpose of this vehicle. It was purposely designed to support these missions doing direct inject to geo for the Space Force.\"",
      "The Vulcan is replacing ULA's already-retired Delta family of rockets and the venerable Atlas 5, which is powered by a Russian-built RD-180 first stage engine. Criticism of ULA's use of Russian engines for launches of American military satellites and NASA spacecraft helped fuel congressional pressure for a new all-American launcher.",
      "Thirteen Atlas 5's are left in ULA's inventory, all of them slated for civilian launches as ULA, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, transitions to an all-Vulcan fleet.",
      "In the meantime, SpaceX dominates the world launch market with its partially reusable and highly successful kerosene-fueled Falcon 9 and triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets. So far this year, SpaceX has launched 97 Falcon 9s.",
      "But ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno said the Vulcan's first stage, using high-performance BE-4 engines provided by Blue Origin \u2014 owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 and its high-power Centaur upper stage make the rocket particularly well suited for launching heavy military payloads into hard-to-reach orbits.",
      "\"It is specifically designed for these exotic orbits that are primarily for the government,\" he said. \"And this particular mission is the quintessential example. It is a direct injection to geosynchronous orbit. That means that it is a very, very long-duration mission.\"",
      "He said the first stage is, in effect, delivering the Centaur to space with a full load of propellant \"to go from LEO (low-Earth orbit) to somewhere else, like all the way to the geo belt, which is 20 times higher up. And what that translates to in capability (is) certainly more mass and more accuracy than is easily done by others.\"",
      "While he didn't mention SpaceX or its Falcon Heavy by name, or ULA's retired Delta 4 Heavy, Bruno said \"if you're a typical three-core heavy launch vehicle and ... really derived from a vehicle optimized for that LEO mission, you're going to have to have three cores to get out there, and you're going to have to expend all of them.",
      "\"And here's the really complicated rocket science. You know, one core is cheaper and more efficient than three expendable cores. It's literally that simple.\"",
      "That, coupled with the high-energy Centaur upper stage, gives ULA the capability to launch heavy payloads directly to high orbits without requiring satellites to use their own thrusters \u2014 and limited propellant \u2014 in transit.",
      "ULA is expanding its ground infrastructure and expects to launch nine flights in 2025, reaching a cadence of two per month by the end of the year. The company expects to launch between 20 and 25 flights in 2026.",

A report from the Anderson Economic Group shows pickup trucks drivers in New York, California and Michigan face \"significantly higher costs\" if they rely on an EV.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-erin-track-path/",
    "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 15:07:12 -0400",
    "summary": "Erin is the first hurricane to develop over the Atlantic this year, and meteorologists are closely tracking its path and forecast.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Erin further weakened to a Category 3 storm early Sunday morning as it churned over the Atlantic Ocean north of the Caribbean. Forecasters with the National Hurricane Center in Miami later said the storm is \"likely to strengthen again.\"",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, exploded to Category 5 on Saturday before weakening, with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph as of Sunday. The storm's center was about 235 miles north of San Juan, Puerto Rico and about 200 miles east of the Grand Turk Island, moving west-northwest at 13 mph.",
      "Still a major storm, a\u00a0Category 3 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds near 125 mph with higher gusts.",
      "Erin is expected to remain powerful for the next several days, forecasters said. The National Hurricane Center's latest update at 2 p.m. Sunday said the central Bahamas, the North Carolina Outer Banks and Bermuda should monitor the progress of Erin as the storm is likely to remain a dangerous major hurricane through the middle of this week.",
      "\"You're dealing with a major hurricane. The intensity is fluctuating. It's a dangerous hurricane in any event,\" said Richard Pasch of the National Hurricane Center.",
      "While Erin's maximum winds diminished, the storm's overall size grew. A tropical storm warning was issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands, as well as the southeastern region of the Bahamas, and winds and heavy rains are whipping the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.",
      "A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, and in this case, within 24 hours, the NHC said. Heavy rain is still expected across the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, with rainfall of 3 to 6 inches, with 8 inches in some isolated areas.",
      "Swells were also expected to affect portions of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and the Turks and Caicos Islands during the next couple of days, the NHC reported.",
      "The storm wasn't expected to directly impact the U.S. East Coast, but by doubling or tripling in size, it could bring rip currents all along the Southeast coast. Gusty winds and flooding tides could wash out parts of the highway that connects the North Carolina Outer Banks by midweek, the National Weather Service said.",
      "What is an eyewall replacement cycle?",
      "The hurricane center disclosed Saturday night that Erin was undergoing an \"eyewall replacement cycle,\" which, according to CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan, is when the storm has become so significantly powerful that its eyewall, its strongest part, reaches maximum strength.",
      "When this happens, Nolan said, the eyewall itself becomes so intense from intaking the available energy from its environment that a new eyewall will begin to build on the outside of the existing, inner eyewall. Once the new eyewall is created, it cuts off the fuel to the original eyewall.",
      "Furthermore, as the new eyewall gains strength to keep up with the power of the storm, the radius of the eye itself will become much larger than it originally was, Nolan said.",
      "This process may cause the storm to weaken temporarily, and its wind speeds may slow as it regains strength.",
      "According to Nolan, however, after this process, the storm could emerge even stronger than it was before.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "Erin's path continued to curve northward, with the center of the hurricane passing just to the north of the northern Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico.",
      "The northern Leewards stretch from the Virgin Islands to Guadeloupe and include St. Martin, St. Barts and other islands.",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of the forecast models shows the storm skirting the Caribbean islands and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it moves north.",
      "A high-pressure system in the Atlantic was expected to steer Erin away from the Eastern Seaboard while a cold front was also forecast to push the hurricane offshore, CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Jessica Burch reported.",
      "On the U.S. Virgin Islands, officials with the National Park Service announced that sites on the island of St. Croix would be closed starting late Friday afternoon until after the storm passes.",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0on Monday west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, forecast an above-normal season for the Atlantic this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms.",
      "Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Forecasters with NOAA anticipated that between five and nine of the storms this year could become hurricanes, which have sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Hurricanes are rated on a scale based on their wind speeds, ranging from Category 1, the weakest, to Category 5, the most severe rating.",
      "NOAA forecasters predicted there could be between two and five major hurricanes in the Atlantic this season.",

      "Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent a Republican redistricting plan are making their way back, each on their own timeline, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "Dozens of Texas House Democrats fled to blue states earlier this month after President Trump suggested the state should redraw its U.S. House district maps to secure more Republican seats. The Democrats have until now remained out of the state to deny Texas' Republican Gov. Greg Abbott a quorum, temporarily derailing a special legislative session that the governor called to reshape the state's congressional maps.",
      "The GOP-led redistricting effort would create five more Republican-leaning House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. Republicans currently have a narrow majority in the House. Historically, the party that controls the White House typically loses ground in midterm elections. States usually redraw districts each decade to reflect population shifts after the decennial census.",
      "After successfully denying Texas Republicans a quorum multiple times in recent weeks, Democrats notched a small victory when the GOP wrapped the initial special session. With a new special session gaveled in on Friday, the Democrats have begun returning. Some are already in Texas, and the caucus is working on a count to tell whether the chamber will have a quorum Monday, the sources told CBS News.",
      "GOP officials in the state have threatened to arrest the lawmakers to compel their appearance at the state Capitol, and one Republican senator enlisted the help of the FBI to track down the legislators.",
      "The Democrats' return comes after they saw another victory with a push by California Democrats to combat the GOP advantage. Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom formally announced a redistricting plan which, under California law, would require a special election. The California governor said the effort is happening \"in reaction to a president of the United States that called a sitting governor of the state of Texas and said 'find me five seats.'\"",
      "\"I know they say don't mess with Texas,\" Newsom said. \"Well, don't mess with the great Golden State.\"",

The awkward conclusion to Friday's summit yielded no formal agreement, with Vladimir Putin still insisting that Ukraine turn over the lands seized by Russia in the war, plus additional territory, something that President Zelenskyy continues to refuse.",
      "We begin with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who attended those talks in Anchorage.",
      "Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Good morning. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin did not give President Trump the cease- fire he sought. And now Putin says the root causes of the conflict have to be resolved in a peace agreement.",
      "Isn't the root cause the fact that Russia invaded in the first place?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, ultimately, yes.",
      "But, I mean, what he means by root causes is this long historical complaints that we've heard repeatedly. This is not a new argument. He's been making this for a long time. And it's the argument that it's Western encroachment. I don't want to get into \u2013 it's just so long.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: But the bottom line is that all of \u2013 you know, we're not going to focus on all of that stuff. We're going to focus on this, are they going to stop fighting or not, and what it's going to take to stop the fighting.",
      "And what it's going to take to stop the fighting, if we're being honest and serious here, is, both sides are going to have to give, and both sides should expect to get something from this. And that's a very difficult thing to do. It's very difficult, because Ukraine obviously feels, you know, harmed, and rightfully so, because they were invaded, and the Russian side, because they feel like they have got momentum in the battlefield, and frankly, don't care, don't seem to care very much about how many Russian soldiers die in this endeavor.",
      "They just churn through it. So I think what the president deserves a lot of credit for is the amount of time and energy that his administration is placing on reaching a peace agreement for a war that's not a war that started under him. It's half \u2013 you know, it's on the other side of the world.",
      "That said, I mean, it's relevant to us. But there are a lot of other issues he could be focused on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So, tomorrow, we'll be meeting with President Zelenskyy. We'll be meeting with European leaders. We just met with Putin. He's dedicated a lot of time and energy because he has made it a priority of his administration to stop or end war, stop wars or prevent them.",
      "And, right now, this is the biggest war going on in the world. It's the biggest war in Europe since World War II. We're going to continue to do everything we can to reach an agreement that ends the dying and the killing and the suffering that's going on right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "You know this well, how long these kind of diplomatic negotiations often take. President Trump was telling European leaders what was discussed was Putin demanding control of Donetsk, a region in the east that his forces do not fully hold. And the U.K. estimates that taking that full area could be as long as another four years.",
      "Putin also is demanding Russian be an official language in Ukraine and something regarding Russian Orthodox churches. Did the U.S. accept all of what Putin laid out at that table?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The United States is not in a position to accept anything or reject anything, because, ultimately, it's up to the Ukrainians. They're the ones that Russia has to make peace with, and Ukraine with Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president said he did come to some agreements.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's up to the Ukrainians to make these conditions.",
      "Well, the agreements were that we were going to try to do things like, for example, get a leader \u2013 a leaders meeting. We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war.",
      "Now, there were some concepts and ideas discussed that we know the Ukrainians could be very supportive of in that meeting. I don't think it's \u2013 we're not going to negotiate this in the media. I understand that everybody wants to know what happened.",
      "But, ultimately, there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs, that are potentials for progress. We'll be discussing that more in depth tomorrow with our European allies, with the Ukrainians that are coming over. We'll be discussing all of these things, because, ultimately, we do need to find areas where we're making progress and try to begin to narrow the gap between the two sides.",
      "But there's a reason why this war has been going on for 3.5 years. And that is, when it comes to the big issues here, there are still some big differences between both sides. Let's see how much progress we can continue to make. It's \u2013 it's \u2013 it's not been easy, but it's something the president has made a priority, peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And he deserves a lot of credit for that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, ultimately, if \u2013 if Vladimir Putin is going to be offered land that he has not seized yet, but negotiates his way into, doesn't this set a dangerous precedent that the United States now accepts this concept that it is OK to seize land by force?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, Putin has already seized land by force, and that, in and of itself, is not a positive precedent. This whole war is a negative president \u2013 precedent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you demanding withdrawal?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, again, here's the \u2013 in order to have a deal here to end \u2013 to reach the end of this conflict, both sides are going to have to make concessions. That's just a fact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But does that mean accepting\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: In any negotiation, if\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 where Russian forces are now?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, no, but, if \u2013 but this is not about acceptance. This is about what Ukraine can accept and what Russia can accept. They both have to accept it. Otherwise, there won't be a peace deal, OK?",
      "If there aren't concessions, if one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender. That's called the end of the war through surrender. And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender or anything close to it.",
      "So, in order for there to be a peace deal \u2013 this is just a fact. We may not like it, it may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful, but in order for there to be an end of the war, there are things Russia wants that it cannot get, and there are things Ukraine wants that it's not going to get.",
      "Both sides are going to have to give up something in order to get to the table in order to make this happen. That's \u2013 that's just the way it is. And, I mean, the sooner we accept that, that's the reality.",
      "Now, what those things are is going to be up to both sides. There's no conditions that can be imposed on Ukraine. They're going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too. And so, for example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to have \u2013 to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security.",
      "That's not an unreasonable request. That's something that needs to be worked on. Territories will have to be discussed. It's just a fact. And there are things that maybe Russia is holding now that they're going to have to give up. Who knows?",
      "The point is, we need to create a scenario where that becomes possible. And that's why this has been so hard, because neither side, up to now, has been willing to give on some of these things. But we'll see if that's possible. It may not be, but we're going to try, and we're going to do everything we can to try to achieve a peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand you \u2013 you can't get into specifics in a public conversation, but we're looking at Russian troops and strikes intensifying. Did you hear anything from Vladimir Putin that indicated he is willing to make a single concession?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think there are a couple. I mean, there were not enough for Ukraine. If not, we would be announcing a peace deal this morning, right?",
      "But \u2013 but, certainly, there are some things we notice, changes. There are some changes that I think are possible. I think there's some concepts that were discussed that could potentially lead to something. But, again, all these things have to be verifiable. We \u2013 it isn't real until it's real.",
      "I mean, you \u2013 one thing is what you say you might be willing to consider. Another thing is your willingness to do it. And it always becomes a tradeoff in all of this. But you talk about the intensifying strikes on the Russian side. Yes, I mean, they're a full-time war machine. I mean, that's what's happening. The Russian economy has basically been turned into a full-time wartime economy.",
      "They have a lot of people. It's a big country. It's not just large geographically. It has huge populations. It continues to churn through people. You know, they lost \u2013 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed last month in July in this war. That just tells you the price they're willing to pay.",
      "Not saying any of this is admirable. I'm saying that this is the reality of the war that we're facing. It's become attrition in some ways. It's a meat grinder, and they just have more meat to grind.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about the security bit you just mentioned there, because Italy's prime minister says that President Trump revived the idea of security guarantees inspired by NATO's Article 5 and a collective security clause that would involve the United States.",
      "How does that work?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are these U.S. troops? Are these U.S. monitors?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, that's what we're going to be working on. Well, that's what we're going to be working on.",
      "That's why \u2013 that's one of the reasons why, you know, I talked yesterday to all the national security advisers, a bunch of them from the different European countries. There are European leaders coming here tomorrow, heads of state coming tomorrow, along with President Zelenskyy, to discuss this in more detail.",
      "I mean, the constructs of something like this needs to be built out. Once thing \u2013 it's \u2013 a concept is one thing. The reality, you know, how it's built and how it would work, is another. But those are the kinds of talks that we're going to be having with them, along with some of the other issues that are at play.",
      "But that \u2013 that is one of the \u2013 if you were to break this thing down, I mean, there are \u2013 obviously, there needs to be an agreement on territories and where the lines are going to be drawn. That's not going to be very easy. That's going to be tough. I think there has to be some discussion about security guarantees for Ukraine, because they don't want this war to \u2013 none of us want to see this war in the future.",
      "They're a sovereign country. They have a right to have security agreements with other countries and security alliances with other countries. And then there's the whole issue of reconstruction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including United States?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: How do you rebuild the country?",
      "Well, potentially. Like I said, that's what we're going to be having a conversation about, and that's what we're going to be meeting \u2013 that's why they're all coming here tomorrow. And that's why we've been talking on the phone for the last 48 hours with them.",
      "And even leading up to it, throughout the week, there were various meetings just to sort of build out some of these ideas. So all of these right now are ideas. They are concepts that require some more specificity. We'll need to work with our partners to see what that looks like.",
      "And I think that's an area where potential progress is real, but that alone won't be enough. There's a bunch of other things that have to be worked through here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, Russia claims it has rescued 700,000 children. I know you know that the warrant out for Vladimir Putin's arrest is for the state-sponsored abduction of kids.",
      "I have seen estimates there are something like 30,000 Ukrainian children who have been abducted. Is the United States demanding, or at least, even just as a statement of goodwill here, that Russia return these children?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I mean, we've repeatedly raised that issue on \u2013 in every forum possible.",
      "And those have also been, by the way, topics of discussion, not just in our meetings with the Ukrainians, but in the negotiations and talks that were going on between Ukraine and Russia at the technical level. These talks were going on in Turkey, as an example, Turkey, over the last few months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, and nothing so far from the Russians.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's been a topic of discussion as well.",
      "Well, it's unfortunate. Children should be returned to their families. We - - on that position, I don't think there's any ambiguity on our side. And they shouldn't even be, you know, a bargaining chip in regards to a broader negotiation.",
      "But it's just one more element of how tragic this war is. After 3.5 years, this war is getting worse. It's not getting better. You've made the point about the uptick in strikes. This is a war. It's going to get worse. It's not going to get better. And that's why the president is investing so much time in bringing this to an end.",
      "And, by the way, everyone is begging us to be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The Europeans want us involved. The Ukrainians want us involved. Obviously, the Russians want us involved, because the president is the only leader in the world \u2013 if this is possible, he's the only one that can help make it happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he's got the leverage over Vladimir Putin if he wanted to crush his economy or at least do more damage to it.",
      "But you have held off on those secondary sanctions. President Trump told Fox News his advice to President Zelenskyy is: \"Make a deal. Russia's a very big power and they're not.\"",
      "You know there is concern from the Europeans that President Zelenskyy is going to be bullied into signing something away. That's why you have these European leaders coming as back up tomorrow. Can you reassure them?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, it isn't. That's not why they're coming as back \u2013 that's not true. No, but that's not \u2013 why would \u2013 that's not true.",
      "They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming \u2013 in fact, they're coming here tomorrow because\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that February Oval Office meeting in front of television cameras, where President Zelenskyy was dressed down\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Do you know how many meetings we've had since then?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, no, I know. And I was just up in Alaska\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, but we've had a bunch of meetings since then.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 watching the one with Vladimir Putin, where a red carpet was rolled out for the Russian leader.",
      "It was very different.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, but with Zelenskyy \u2013 we've had more meetings - - we've had \u2013 we've had \u2013 we've had one meeting with Putin and like a dozen meetings with Zelenskyy.",
      "So, that \u2013 but that's not true. They're not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're coming here tomorrow because we've been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. There were meetings in the U.K. over the following \u2013 the previous weekend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they said President Trump was going to demand a cease-fire.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The president's talked to these leaders as early as Thursday.",
      "No, no, but you said that they're coming here tomorrow to keep Zelenskyy from being bullied. They're not coming here tomorrow \u2013 this is such a stupid media narrative that they're coming here tomorrow because the \u2013 Trump is going to bully Zelenskyy into a bad deal.",
      "We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff. They're coming here tomorrow because they chose to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president told those European leaders last week that he wanted a cease-fire. The president went on television, said he would walk out of the meeting if Vladimir Putin didn't agree with on \u2013 he said there would be severe consequences if he didn't agree to one. He said he'd walk out in two minutes.",
      "He spent three hours talking to Vladimir Putin, and he did not get one. So, there's some mixed messages.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Because, obviously, something \u2013 things happened during that meeting.",
      "Well, because obviously things \u2013 look, our goal here is not to stage some production, for the world to say, oh, how dramatic. He walked out. Our goal here is to have a peace agreement, to end this war, OK? And, obviously, we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress, not a lot of progress, but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.",
      "If not, we wouldn't be having Zelenskyy flying all the way over here. We wouldn't be having all the Europeans coming all the way over here. Now, understand, and take with a grain of salt, I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.",
      "You talk about the sanctions. Look, at the end of the day, if peace is not going to be possible here, and this is just going to continue on as a war, people will continue to die by the thousands. The president has that option to then come in and impose new sanctions.",
      "But if he did this now \u2013 the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks. You've basically locked in at least another year to year-and-a-half of war and death and destruction. We may unfortunately wind up there, but we don't want to wind up there.",
      "We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war, so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here. We're going to do everything possible to make that happen, if it's doable.",
      "It will require both sides to make concessions. It will require both sides to get things they're asking for. That's how these deals are made, whether we like it or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, quickly, why did the State Department just announce that they're halting visitor visas for all Gazans coming here for medical aid? Why would some of these kids, for example, who are coming to hospitals for treatment be a threat?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, it's not just kids. It's a bunch of adults that are accompanying them.",
      "Second, we had outreach from multiple congressional offices asking questions about it. And so we're going to reevaluate how those visas are being granted, not just to the children, but how those visas are being granted to the people who are accompanying them, and, by the way, to some of the organizations that are facilitating it.",
      "There is evidence been presented to us by numerous congressional offices that some of the organizations bragging about and involved in acquiring these visas have strong links to terrorist groups like Hamas. And so we are not going to be in partnership with groups that are friendly with Hamas.",
      "So we need to \u2013 we're going to pause those visas. There was just a small number of them issued to children, but they come with adults accompanying them, obviously. And we are going to pause this program and reevaluate how those visas are being vetted and what relationship, if any, has there been by these organizations to the \u2013 to the process of acquiring those visas.",
      "We're not going to be in partnership with groups that have links or sympathies towards Hamas.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow.",
      "Good to see you in person.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW (D-Colorado): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we start talking about Ukraine, I want to pick up on something, since you sit on the Intelligence Committee.",
      "The secretary of state just said that lawmakers had come to the Trump administration with information that they have been granting visas to individuals with ties to Hamas or with organizations with ties to Hamas. That's a pretty stunning accusation. Israel controls who enters and exits Gaza.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States screens all visas. So is there really a blind spot that you are aware of?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I'm not aware of that. But, if that's true, actually, that is concerning. That would be a problem. I mean, Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. They should not be traveling anywhere. So, if that's happening, it should be stopped immediately. And the Intelligence Committee has a role to play in that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Intelligence Committee wasn't behind the information presented to the secretary of state?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I have not been briefed on that. I have no information about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "On Ukraine, you know that the U.S. intelligence assessment is that the battlefield is turning in Russia's favor, despite the fact that Putin has to rely on Iran and North Korea to keep this thing going. If neither President Biden nor President Trump were ever willing to commit troops, doesn't the secretary have a point that it has to be hammered out at the negotiating table?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You know, this absolutely will end at a negotiating table, like most conflicts will.",
      "But what happened on Friday was a historic embarrassment for the United States. There's no other way to put it, right? You listen to what Marco Rubio and the president have said. They keep on saying they're dedicating time. They're making it a priority. They're focusing their attention on it.",
      "In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary. What is making Vladimir Putin tick in this instance? Vladimir Putin does not care about the amount of time that we're nego \u2013 we're allocating to this, does not care about a B-2 bomber flyover, does not care about a lineup of F-22 fighters rolled out.",
      "He doesn't care about any of that. What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things. He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions. He cares about political, diplomatic isolation, being a pariah state. And he cares about military defeat. Those are the three things that will end this conflict, if he feels pressure on all of those three fronts.",
      "And this administration continues to be unwilling to do anything to assert pressure in any of those three areas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they have put in place some secondary sanctions, at least on India here. And they haven't pulled back. They would need Congress to help them repeal a lot of these sanctions.",
      "But bigger picture, in hindsight, do you think the United States to date has been too hesitant to actually help Ukraine win this war? President Obama did not send offensive weapons to Ukraine. President Biden was criticized for being perhaps too slow in delivery of certain weapons.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, there's no doubt.",
      "As you know, I was one of the members of Congress that on a bipartisan basis pushed really hard in the first two years of this war under the Biden administration to do more, to do more quicker. And I was concerned that we were doing just enough to prevent Ukraine from losing and not doing enough to help them win.",
      "And I do believe that, had we done more, and we had done \u2013 done it faster, and that we were willing to be more aggressive in providing aid and support for Ukraine, then they would be in a different position on the battlefield today.",
      "But compare that to what this administration has done, which has relieved almost all pressure. Like, look at what happened on Friday.",
      "U.S. military personnel in uniform literally were on their hands and knees rolling out a red carpet for the most murderous dictator of the 21st century, somebody who has kidnapped and is holding prisoner tens of thousands of Ukrainian children, somebody who started this whole war, right?",
      "This both-sides-ism that the administration is engaging in, that both sides need to come to the table and negotiate, Ukraine is the victim. They are the victim. They didn't start this war. Russia did. And somehow we keep on acting like Vladimir Putin deserves to be brought out into the open like any other head of state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This is a historic embarrassment and defeat for U.S. foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have served this country in uniform.",
      "I wonder, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, how comfortable you would be with the United States giving this, whatever the Article 5- like security guarantee would look like. Is that something you should see boots on the ground to do?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I don't think boots on the ground would be the way to go, but, certainly, the United States has assets and capability that I think are essential to any type of security guarantee.",
      "I think Europe has to come forward with the forward presence of military, but we can provide intelligence. We can provide economic support, diplomatic support. One of the most important things that we can do right now is actually seize Russian assets. This would be huge. This would be a game-changing thing that would put pressure on Vladimir Putin and actually create security guarantees and reconstruction for Ukraine.",
      "There's over $150 billion of seized Russian assets. And the United States could lead a coalition to seize that money\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 allocate it towards reconstruction, allocate it towards security, allocate it towards the building of a Ukrainian military that could actually resist Russia going forward. But this administration is unwilling to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The last administration was too.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They did agree to the legislation.",
      "But on the immigration front, you and your fellow Democratic lawmakers are now trying to challenge the Trump administration's policy that requires notice to be given before you visit an immigration facility. You just did visit some. What did you see? And how does that compare to the last administration?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, there's an ICE detention center in my district in Aurora, Colorado. I have visited that center 10 times now over the last five years, six years.",
      "And oversight of federal facilities is one of the most important things that any member of Congress does, Air Force bases, military bases, VA hospitals, and ICE detention centers. This administration just tripled the budget of ICE, made it the largest federal law enforcement agency in the history of the United States, bigger than the FBI, ATF, DEA, all others combined.",
      "And they are putting in roadblocks to prevent oversight, to prevent transparency because they are trying to hide what they are doing. That is unacceptable. So we filed a lawsuit to force them to abide by federal law that guarantees us access.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And we will see where that heads next.",
      "Jason Crow, thank you.",
      "We will be right back.",

      "Fiona Hill served as the senior director for Russia and European affairs on the National Security Council during President Trump's first term. She joins us now from Waterville, Maine.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "FIONA HILL (Former NSC Senior Director, European and Russian Affairs): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Fiona, you were an advisor during that infamous Helsinki summit in 2018. You've spoke about that in the past. I wonder what you think about how this Alaska summit compared.",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, obviously quite different in \u2013 in many respects. Part of it was the fact that they decided to skip the one-on-one meeting and the lunch. I mean these are usually part of this sort of set of summits like this. And the press conference, obviously, was more of an announcement or a set of announcements. Presentations by both leaders, much more by President Putin, and more of a commentary by President Trump. So, there wasn't that free for all of press questions, which I'm sure was a bit disconcerting for you and others who were present there at Alaska.",
      "But the optics weren't exactly great, as Congressman Crow has laid out, for the United States and for President Trump again. I mean, again, different. But although it was presented as perhaps a show of power by being at a U.S. Air Force Base with the flight passing of the B-52s and the fighter jets, it did certainly looked much more like a show of appreciation for Vladimir Putin. And so the optics were really much more favorable to Putin than they were to the United States. It really looked like Putin set the agenda there, the narrative, and in many respects the tone for the whole summit meeting.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, saying that, you know, the president has a team of advisors around him. In a traditional administration, those advisors would be setting the policy, they would be planning the optics, and they would be thinking through that.",
      "Do you think that the president's team set him up for success here?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, look, it may well have been that one of the demands, because we've heard from Secretary Rubio, which, I have to say, I think was a very fair assessment of where things are. So, it may well have been that one of the demands by the Russians to make any progress in moving further forward was to actually have that kind of show of pomp and pageantry that is \u2013 basically marks Putin's re-entry into international affairs. Maybe the Russians said to them in Moscow, either to Steve Witkoff or to Secretary Rubio or to anybody else that basically they wanted to have a \u2013 a major U.S./Russia bilateral summit appearance before they would move on to the nitty-gritty of anything else in Ukraine. That's, you know, to give them all the benefit of the doubt there.",
      "But it all now depends on what comes out of this. And I think, again, Secretary Rubio made it very clear that it's not going to be easy. He was certainly downplaying any expectations of a major breakthrough, but he did say that it was something that might be possible. And I think that's what's going to be the proof of whether this was actually worth all the effort that they went to in Alaska or not.",
      "And as Congressman Crow said, there's a pretty high bar here because what Putin is doing is pretty brutal. And he's not showing right now any signs whatsoever of giving anything up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom's defense secretary has said that they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help oversee a ceasefire. When you hear these security guarantees being talked about, and the secretary said he is going to negotiate that tomorrow, what should we think \u2013 you know, what form is that going to take? What do you think that should look like?",
      "FIONA HILL: Well, look, I think he actually let this out, and you did too in your questions. And I think Congressman Crow has made it very clear as well, it has to be a combination of all of the things that we've already heard discussed on the show today. You have to be able to have some boots on the ground. Congressman Crow said it doesn't have to be the United States. That's actually the case. But it actually has to be some commitment from the United States to enable European forces to actually hold that territory and to provide some security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "The United States is key in terms of its intelligence, in terms of enabling equipment and the information of the data that we would need for all of this to make a security intervention mean something. And it's also essential in terms of all kinds of other forms of equipment and defensive weaponry. We've already heard, of course, about Ukraine needing all kinds of equipment, from javelins in the past, to patriots, now in terms of an integrated missile defense system that Ukraine desperately needs. So, there's a lot there that we all know needs to be done.",
      "And what we really need to see, I think, in these meetings that will take place on Monday and moving forward, is a real commitment to the United States to work with Europeans and to work with Ukraine to make this happen.",
      "Look, this is existential also for European security. So, minimizing the role of Europe here, be it the United Kingdom, be it Poland, be it Finland, be it France, be it Germany, is not the way to go. Europe has to have an equal say in all of this. This is about Europe's future and the future of European security, not just about Ukraine's.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the dynamic between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. You know both men. You've written biographies of Vladimir Putin and, of course, you served under Donald Trump. In one of the Fox interviews that President Trump did, he said that he spoke about mail- in voting in the United States with Vladimir Putin. And during that press address, Putin also claimed that the war wouldn't have happened at all if Donald Trump had been pretty. I mean that's a counter factual, but that's something Trump often says on the \u2013 on the trail. Why would those things be discussed at all if this was about Ukraine?",
      "FIONA HILL: Exactly. Well, look, this is Vladimir Putin, as usual, trying to manipulate U.S. domestic politics. I've seen him do this over and over again, including at Helsinki when he set the president off, not in the press conference, but before that, in a whole diatribe against his political enemies because Putin deliberately asked him about this.",
      "So, Putin knows that President Trump wants to have an acknowledgment of his self-assertion, that the war wouldn't have happened had he not \u2013 had he been in the presidency. And so Putin's giving him something that plays well for President Trump and his own domestic environment. It doesn't play well in the international environment where people know things are much more complicated but it's basically gifting a concession to President Trump himself.",
      "And Putin wants to sow chaos in the American electoral system ahead of the midterms. So, of course, he's laid into this whole issue of mail-in voting. And President Trump asserted in his Fox News interview that there were no countries in the world that allow mail-in voting. Well, Russia allows mail- in voting. And if everybody wants to go out and look, they can look for themselves. In 2020, President Vladimir Putin signed into law Russians being able to vote by mail and also on the internet. And more than 30 other countries also allow some forms of mail-in voting. So, it's just not true that other countries, including Russia, don't use this. It's a pure blatant piece of manipulation, and that's the kind of thing that Putin likes to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, of course, I don't think you would endorse the outcome of that voting system and those elections are rigged in Russia, correct?",
      "FIONA HILL: Of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: And, I mean, basically Putin wants to see us tie ourselves up in knots between now and the midterms. He's trying to sew chaos. And he's just better used his time with President Trump to push that along.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FIONA HILL: It's \u2013 again, it's a diversion. It's a distraction really from the negotiations on Ukraine because Putin doesn't really want to give anything up. So, he gives up basically something that plays well in the political arena for President Trump and something that actually plays very badly for the United States in its own political arena, which is the mail- in voting point that he made.",

      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \"The Telegraph\" was reporting offering Putin a chance to invest in the natural resources off of Alaska's coast, in the Bearing Strait.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN (R-AK): Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with that?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, we have plenty of America investors and our allies who want to invest in Alaska's natural resources. We're having a boom here. We don't need Russian investments. We don't need Russian money. They're a competitor of ours when it comes to energy and natural resources and critical minerals. So, I doubt that's on the table. And, you know, I would not \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You'd be upset if there was?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I would not \u2013 I would not support that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleague \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And by the way, just to \u2013 on that point though, a contrast. You might remember last time I was on your show we talked about the Biden administration \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about this.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: With this great state of ours.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Shutting us down, right? I mean that was 70 executive orders to shut down, exclusively focused on Alaska, shut down our resource development economy. Our own federal government, the Biden administration, sanctioned my state more than they sanctioned Iran. What we're seeing with President Trump in his administration is a complete 180 on that. Unleashing Alaska's resource potential has been a huge focus of the president since day one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you mentioned how furious you were with the Biden administration for the executive actions they said they were taking to protect natural resources.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They said land conservation was necessary, and the indigenous population here really wanted it.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Right. Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You called it a lie.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I did call it a lie. It was a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said it was national security suicide. Trump has already reversed this.",
      "But are you at all concerned that there are short-term benefits to your state financially, but longer term real damage to the environment here?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: No. Look, Alaska has an incredible record of being able to develop our resources and protect the environment. You walk around here, you see what a pristine, beautiful environment we have here. But we know we need jobs. We need natural resource development. So, we can do both. The entire north slope of Alaska, the Nupiet (ph) community, across the board was against what the Biden administration did, which was lock up the entire natural petroleum reserve of Alaska, which was set aside by Congress to develop our resources. And then he had the audacity to say, hey, I did this on behalf of the native people. That was not true at all. It was an outrage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so, for activists or for those concerned about the damage here \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You say they just don't know what they're talking about?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, I say \u2013 well, a couple things. There's no place on the planet that has higher standards on protecting the environment than us. And if we need American energy, why would we go, like the Biden administration did, begging from Iran, Venezuela, places that have no environmental standards, when you can get it from America, from American workers, with the highest environmental standards any place on the planet. And secondly, when you have resource development, particularly in our rural communities, you see life expectancies increases \u2013 increasing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in this region \u2013",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Arctic is of supreme concern from a national security perspective.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The ice is melting.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Majority of scientists attribute that to global warming, but the end result is there's a potential for an Arctic area for trade routes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Also tapping into the natural resources there.",
      "How does the United States gain an edge in \u2013 in dominating that?",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, it's a great question. It's really important. You're mentioning trade routes that are opening up. We've already talked about natural resources, which are huge, up in the Arctic. And what we need to do is recognize that we're an Arctic nation. We're an Arctic nation because of Alaska.",
      "And, look, this has not always been a priority of previous administrations. What we're doing up here, we're rebuilding our military. The one big, beautiful bill certainly does it. As I mentioned, you know, Alaska exudes military might. We're the cornerstone of missile defense, and we're going to be the cornerstone of the president's golden dome initiative. We are the hub of air combat power. You're seeing them flying over here. We have over 100 fifth generation fighters based in Alaska. We have a brand-new U.S. Army airborne division up here. So, we are building out our military, which is great, but also building out our Arctic capabilities.",
      "And again, in the one big, beautiful bill, almost $26 billion investment in the Coast Guard, which is the biggest investment in the Coast Guard in American history by far, 16 icebreakers coming with that, 22 cutters, 40 helicopters, a bunch of shore side infrastructure, a lot of that's going to be in Alaska to defend the Arctic. And we need to defend the Arctic because, as you and I have talked about, the Russians and the Chinese are in our waters and in our airspace all the time, including doing joint operations up here, which is unprecedented.",

      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: All right, I mean, I've been working on this with the Pentagon. This is missile defense that is a layered missile defense. So, what that means is, right here, like I said, you have the ground-based missile interceptor \u2013 the missile interceptors in Alaska. You have all the radar systems in Alaska that protect the whole country in terms of ballistic missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: We have new threats. We have hypersonics. We have drones. We have, heck, even we've seen it here in Alaska, spy balloons. What we need to do is upgrade the system with what's called a layered defense. Not just the ground-based system here, but you work it more with different systems, Aegis Ashore, THAD, and then including space-based systems, both for tracking and intercepting. And you to do that with an open architecture in terms of software to integrate those systems. So, I am very familiar with what the golden dome is doing and I'm leading the effort in the Senate on it.",

And I was able to visit the few warehouses we have there, the bakery, the kitchens. And I spending a day trying to see what else the teams need, what else we need to be doing, how we are going to be increasing the hot food and bread we are producing right now.

I saw those boxes be made with the name of every one of the children. We need to remember that during many weeks no food was going inside Gaza. And this is to 2 million people.",

We need to make sure that all the NGOs that are actively trying to do the best they can to take care of people inside Gaza, and this is beyond food, obviously medicine, et cetera, et cetera, we need to make sure that the aid is massive enough that we don't get to those moments where in some areas, like in the north, that these are still very difficult to reach, that we know that people are desperate for food.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned for many weeks no food was allowed in. That was a government policy. There was a blockade for many months. That is now lifted officially.",
      "But as you say, your organization wants to scale up. You are trying to produce 1 million meals a day in Gaza. Can you get the fuel in to do that? Can you get the food in? Are Israeli officials giving you a green light?",
      "JOSE ANDRES: Well, it's a million because we \u2013 we are an organization that we specialize in emergencies and in food. But really we are requesting that all the NGOs that are participating in feeding are giving more access, including us, and other organizations, like Anera (ph), which was one of the organizations we work with that they have been in Gaza for many, many decades, and many others. We need to make sure that everybody has access. For that we need a lot of things. The trucks inside Gaza. We need to remember that the trucks come from outside Gaza. And they are \u2013 they are put aside. And then we need to reload the trucks that are inside Gaza. This takes time. We need more trucks inside. So, the trucking company can have enough people and enough trucks to have a constant flow.",
      "I have to report that as I saw a good flow of trucks going in, around 150 to 250 trucks are going in every day. But even I would say that this is not enough. We need to make sure that we massively increase, that we massively make sure that nobody has to be walking for miles to try to reach a place where they can find a plate of food or use a bag of rice. We need to make sure like what World Central Kitchen does. At one moment we had, you know, 100 to 200 kitchen partners. We need to make sure that we are cooking where people live. We need to make sure that we are feeding them where people are so the people don't have to be again leaving their neighborhoods, leaving their tents and walking for hours back and forth only to try to bring a little bit of food back home.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that \"both sides are going to have to make concessions\" to end Russia's war in Ukraine, hinting at the road ahead for talks aimed at getting Moscow and Kyiv to reach a lasting peace agreement.",
      "\"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" noting that doing so would require both sides \"to give.\"",
      "Full transcript: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "Full transcript: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"",
      "President Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday following his\u00a0high-stakes summit with Putin in Alaska last Friday. Mr. Trump called the nearly three-hour meeting with Putin \"extremely productive\" with \"many points\" the two leaders agreed on. But \"there's no deal until there's a deal,\" he said, and no ceasefire was announced.",
      "Rubio, who attended the summit, was thin on details Sunday, saying that \"there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs.\" He added that the details would be discussed with Zelenskyy and other European leaders on Monday as the administration works to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "\"We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war,\" Rubio said, noting that there were \"some concepts and ideas discussed\" with Putin that they expect the Ukrainians would support.",
      "When asked whether the U.S. would demand Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory as part of an agreement, the secretary of state acknowledged that both sides would have to make concessions in order to reach a deal to end the conflict.",
      "\"If one side gets everything they want, that's called surrender,\" Rubio said. \"And that's not what we're close to doing, because neither side here is on the verge of surrender, or anything close to it.\"",
      "Rubio outlined a handful of areas where agreement needs to be reached, including the details of security guarantees for Ukraine, the question of territories \"and where the lines are going to be drawn\" and the issue of rebuilding the country. He said the ideas \"require some more specificity,\" noting that the U.S. will \"need to work with our partners to see what that looks like.\"",
      "Monday's discussions come after Zelenskyy met with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance in February, when an Oval Office meeting descended into insults and chaos, exposing severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine.",
      "Rubio pushed back on the idea that European leaders are joining Zelenskyy in Washington as backup to prevent him from accepting a bad deal after the contentious meeting earlier this year.",
      "\"We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff,\" Rubio said. \"They're coming here tomorrow because they're supposed to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.\"",
      "The secretary said that after the meeting with Putin, \"we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress \u2014 not a lot of progress \u2014 but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement,\" Rubio added. \"Enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",
      "Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, appeared on \"Face the Nation\" after Rubio, and called the meeting with Putin a \"historic embarrassment\" while outlining what he says is needed to end the war.",
      "\"In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary, what is making Vladimir Putin tick, in this instance,\" Crow said.",
      "Crow argued that Putin doesn't care about things like a B-2 stealth bomber flyover and a lineup of F-22 fighter jets, which were part of a carefully choreographed red-carpet welcome in Alaska.",
      "\"What Vladimir Putin cares about is basically three things: He cares about economic pressure in the form of sanctions; he cares about political, diplomatic isolation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0being a pariah state; and he cares about military defeat,\" Crow said. \"Those are the three things that will end this conflict.\"",

    "summary": "Special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff says Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.",
      "\"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" He added that it \"was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that\" and called them \"game-changing.\"",
      "Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.",
      "Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.",
      "Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not \"go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. And there was plenty more.\"",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. \"We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the 'Coalition of the willing' \u2014 including the European Union \u2014 is ready to do its share,\" she said.",
      "Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but said much was unclear.",
      "\"It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine,\" he said, \"But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees.\"",
      "Witkoff defended Mr. Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which the president had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.",
      "\"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,\" Witkoff said, without elaborating. \"We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.\"",
      "Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.",
      "\"If he did this now, the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks,\" Rubio said. \"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here.\"",
      "Rubio said that Kyiv \"is going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too.\"",
      "\"For example, Ukraine is a sovereign country. They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security,\" Rubio said. \"That's not an unreasonable request. That's something needs to be worked on.\"",
      "Zelenskyy and Europeans leaders, who heard from Mr. Trump after the summit, are scheduled to meet with him at the White House on Monday.",
      "\"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this,\" Rubio said.",

      "The European leaders' presence at Zelenskyy's side, demonstrating Europe's support for Ukraine, could potentially help ease concerns in Kyiv and in other European capitals that Ukraine risks being railroaded into a peace deal that Mr. Trump says he wants to broker with Russia.",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Rubio pushed back on the idea that European leaders are joining Zelenskyy in Washington to provide the Ukrainian president with backup to prevent him from accepting a bad deal after the contentious meeting earlier this year.",
      "\"We've been working with these people for weeks, for weeks on this stuff,\" Rubio said. \"They're coming here tomorrow because they're supposed to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come.\"",
      "The secretary outlined that after the meeting with Putin, \"we felt, and I agreed, that there was enough progress \u2014 not a lot of progress \u2014 but enough progress made in those talks to allow us to move to the next phase.\"",
      "\"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement,\" Rubio added. \"Enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",

      "In the high desert of West Texas, there's a trail dodging cactus. No signs or guideposts here \u2026 just the crunch of gravel underfoot, and above, a wide-open sky. But for those in the know, like Matt Walter, this is the journey to a local legend.",
      "It's become known as The Desk on Hancock Hill. Locals call it simply \"the desk\" \u2026 an unlikely landmark in the city of Alpine that's been holding court for more than 45 years.",

      "An amateur photographer, Walter has documented the changes over the years. The desk isn't much to look at. It could have come from any classroom \u2013 weathered by the weather, and covered in graffiti.",
      "But when seated at it, and looking out over the desert, you feel changed.",
      "Walter said he has felt introspective when visiting the desk: \"I've had a couple of moments like that where you reflect on the views, the distance, looking out onto this vastness, and wondering about the amazement of Mother Nature,\" he said.",
      "Dani Bell, who was visiting the site, said, \"It's very therapeutic. You can clear your mind and really just get some stuff out if you need to.\"",
      "What may be more remarkable than the feeling it inspires is how it came to be.",
      "In the late 1970s, Jim Kitchen was a student at nearby Sul Ross State University. He wanted a place to study with a view, so with a couple of classmates, they hauled up a desk, planting it at the top, like a flag on a new frontier.",

      "Curry showed us one of the earlier desks. (They're now swapped out every decade or so, as the elements and visitors take a toll.) And Kitchen left more than a desk up here \u2013 also, a notebook and pen, because with vast views come big thoughts.",
      "Curry said he'd written in the book many times. \"It's kind of like a meditative place, you know, where you can go and you can just think about things and kind of sort out your problems,\" he said.",
      "Dozens of filled notebooks, dating back decades, are catalogued at the university library, and meticulously preserved by the school's archivist.",
      "You might call Paula Kitchen Curry, Jim's sister, the unofficial archivist, having gone up to the desk at least 30 times to rotate out the notebooks. \"I've copied them one time and sent them to my brother, just so he can see what has happened,\" she said.",
      "What she's comes back with is something akin to a confession booth wrapped in a time capsule \u2026 the entries, often heartbreaking.",

      "Reading the entries, Paula said, \"Sometimes it breaks my heart, and sometimes it makes me laugh, sometimes it makes me want to be a better writer!\"",
      "Asked what he believes the notebooks, and the solitude at the desk, provide to people, Tony Curry said, \"There are times when you find yourself looking for a way to get something out of your head, and going up to the desk gives you time to think about it, and then the notebook gives you a place to put it down, and then the journey back down gives you a place to kind of leave it behind.\"",

She had been fatally stabbed in the back, sexually assaulted and decapitated. Her head was nowhere to be found. Investigators discovered she had been attacked on the nearby bike path, and her bike was also missing.",

Fitzpatrick's company, Identifinders International, had developed software that could mine public genealogy databases, searching for matches to crime scene DNA. Phoenix police sent her the DNA information from the canal murders. Fitzpatrick's company crunched the data and came up with the surname Miller.

But after observing Miller's mild temperament and his rapport with his daughter, Schwartzkopf doubted Miller could be the person responsible for the brutal canal murders in the early 1990s.",

      "Trial for the canal murders",
      "Miller's trial began in October 2022. His attorney's admitted Miller was the canal killer but said that due to abuse he endured as a child, he developed severe mental health problems. His lawyers argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity.",
      "A psychologist testified that Miller developed a condition known as dissociative amnesia - an inability to remember some traumatic events. Miller's attorneys claimed he had no memory of the canal murders. Miller claims he did not commit the murders.",

He liked to attend popular zombie walks and other festivals in Phoenix dressed as a character known as the Zombie Hunter, and fans and police officers posed with him.",
      "When he was in character, Miller wore a homemade costume with goggles and a menacing mask and carried a fake Gatling gun. He also drove and tricked out an old Crown Victoria police car, splashed it with fake blood and put the name Zombie Hunter on the back. He also often put a ghoulish mannequin in the back seat behind bars.",
      "The day they met for dinner, Miller had driven his distinctive car to Chili's. That certainly caught Schwartkopf's attention, but the detective still didn't believe Bryan Miller was the canal killer. One of the reasons he was a potential suspect was because a genetic genealogist had matched the name Miller to the crime scene DNA.",

      "Miller ordered a burger and a glass of water. \"He swallows his hamburger, in like, five bites, Schwartzkopf said. \"Won't take a drink of his water. And I'm sitting there going, 'Are you sure you\u2026don't want\u2026something else to drink? You just got water.' 'No, no, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.'\"",
      "But then to Schwartkopf's relief, Miller finally took a sip of water: \"That's when I knew that, OK, now we've at least got his DNA.\"",
      "As soon as Miller walked out, undercover detectives secured the glass Miller had used. Miller then gave Schwartzkopf a quick tour of his Zombie Hunter car before he left.",
      "Eleven days later, the detective got a visit from the head of the forensic lab. Schwartzkopf told Van Sant what happened. \"She leans down to me, she goes, 'It's him.' I go 'What?' She goes, 'Bryan Miller, it's him.' \u2026 Well, the blood rushed from my head. \u2026 I kind of sat back and I went, 'You've gotta be kidding.'\"",
      "Miller was arrested immediately and denied he had killed anyone. The case took almost eight years to get to trial, but Miller was convicted of murdering Brosso and Bernas and received the death penalty in June 2023.",
      "Under Arizona law, Miller will receive an automatic appeal."

      "The murders of two young women, killed months apart while riding their bikes along a canal in Phoenix, Arizona, went unsolved for more than two decades and would become known as the Phoenix canal murders.",
      "Investigators got a break 21 years after the murders thanks to DNA and genetic genealogy. They zeroed in on Bryan Patrick Miller, 42, a divorced father raising his teenage daughter. Investigators soon discovered Miller had an alter ego. He was a local celebrity known for participating in parades and festivals as the Zombie Hunter.",
      "A person of interest, detectives just needed a sample of Miller's DNA to make the case or eliminate him as a suspect.",
      "TWO YOUNG WOMEN VICIOUSLY MURDERED ALONG BIKE PATH",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: It's one of those cases that you just don't forget \u2026 you can't unsee what happened to those girls, you just can't.",
      "Long before the man known as the Zombie Hunter became the prime suspect in the canal murders, Clark Schwartzkopf was a detective with the Phoenix Police Department's cold case squad. His mission was simple but pointed: find the killer responsible for those vicious murders of two young women from the early 1990s.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: To this day, I'm still not exactly sure about what \u2026 happened on those \u2026 bike paths.",
      "The case began on Nov. 8, 1992. Angela Brosso, a tech worker who had recently moved to Phoenix, was taking advantage of beautiful weather to get in a little exercise, says Briana Whitney, the true crime reporter for the CBS affiliate KPHO in Phoenix.",
      "Briana Whitney: Each night, she would go out for her evening bike ride just at golden hour at sunset, the best time to be riding out here.",
      "Angela was only hours away from turning 22, and, like a lot of locals, she liked to bike on the paths that ran alongside the city's distinctive canals, says Schwartzkopf, a \"48 Hours\" consultant.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Are there places that are sort of natural ambush sites if somebody wants to attack someone?",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: Yeah, they are \u2026 there's a lot of tunnels that go underneath the interstate.",
      "That November evening in 1992, Angela left her apartment around 7 p.m., her boyfriend Joe later told police. He said he stayed home to bake Angela a birthday cake and didn't expect her to be gone long.",
      "Briana Whitney: Hours go by, and Joe grows concerned. Angela hasn't come home. And that's not like her.",
      "Joe told police he took his bike out three times that night, frantically searching for Angela on the canal paths. He spoke to her friends -- even her mother back in Pennsylvania. Finally, he reported Angela missing to police. The next morning, searchers came upon a horrific scene.",
      "Briana Whitney: Angela Brosso's torso was found in a field next to the trail that she had been riding her bike on.",
      "Angela had been stabbed to death.",
      "Approximately 10 days after Angela's headless body was discovered, a man fishing along this section of the canal, spotted her head stuck on a grate.",
      "Morgan Loew, an investigative reporter who also works at KPHO and is a \"48 Hours\" consultant, has been working on the canal killer case for more than a decade.",
      "Morgan Loew: And from what we have heard from witnesses \u2026 the head was in amazingly good condition, especially considering this was days after the murder. \u2026 We've heard that the head looked like it had been preserved \u2026 Like it was a memento for the killer.",
      "Angela's purple mountain bike was also missing. There were no solid leads, and the case went quiet until September 1993\u201410 months after Angela's murder\u2014when the mother of 17-year-old Melanie Bernas returned from a dinner date to find her daughter had broken her curfew and was not home. She then noticed that Melanie's bicycle was missing.",
      "Morgan Loew: Melanie decides to go on a bike ride \u2026 by around 10:30 when Melanie did not return, her mother \u2026 started calling her friends. \"Is Melanie there?\"",
      "Rachel Schepemaker: Well, my mom took the phone call \u2026 said that Melanie's mom was frantic and like nervous \u2026",
      "Rachel Schepemaker was one of Melanie's close friends in high school.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So initially when you hear \u2026 that her mother's looking for her \u2026 You're not thinking something terrible has happened to your friend?",
      "Rachel Schepemaker: Definitely not. I thought she was with a friend and just forgot to communicate with her mom where she was.",
      "Early the next morning Charlotte Pottle, a local resident, happened to be riding along the canal with her young daughter in a bicycle seat. Just as they came out of one of those tunnels that ran under the interstate, she spotted a puddle.",
      "Charlotte Pottle: There was just a big puddle of something. \u2026 Ended up riding right through it \u2026 and having it splash up over me.",
      "Pottle says something about the puddle bothered her, so a few minutes later she doubled back. That's when she made a horrible realization.",
      "Charlotte Pottle: I could tell that it was a puddle of red, that it was a puddle of blood.",
      "Charlotte Pottle (pointing to a tree): And all of a sudden, as I'm looking at it, I noticed that there are some drag marks that went along over here.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Toward that tree.",
      "Charlotte Pottle: Towards that tree. Yes. \u2026 And then went around the tree and was drugged back \u2026 you could see the drag marks right here to the canal.",
      "Pottle went home and called police. Later that night, the local news reported that a woman's body had been found in the canal, close to where Angela Brosso's head had been located.",
      "Rachel Schepemaker: They found the body in a teal bodysuit. I was told by some other friends that Melanie did not own that. It can't be her.",
      "Schepemaker went to sleep convinced the body in the canal was not Melanie. But the next day \u2014",
      "Rachel Schepemaker: I'm at school \u2026 my friends just come up to me crying and saying it was Melanie.",
      "Detectives strongly suspected Melanie had been targeted and stabbed in the back by the same person who had killed Angela.",
      "Morgan Loew: Police believe that somehow, the killer got her off of her bike, whether he knocked her off of her bike or whether he asked her a question.",
      "Schwartzkopf says the evidence indicates the killer approached the women from behind.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf :Both the knife wounds were the exact same position.",
      "Investigators say the killer dragged Melanie's body off the canal path removed her clothes and dressed her in that teal bodysuit.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Along with the stabbing and the dismemberment, there was another component to these murders, wasn't there?",
      "Briana Whitney: Yeah, both women were sexually assaulted.",
      "And that meant investigators had a crucial piece of evidence: DNA.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: when the DNA from Melanie's scene was finally tested later, it \u2026 matched to Angela's scene. So, we knew for sure that we were dealing with the same perpetrator.",
      "Investigators noted that the initial stab wounds to the backs of each woman were fatal and so precise that detectives suspected the killer might be a surgeon.",
      "Morgan Loew: The details about what happened \u2026 were the kinds of things that kept parents from letting their kids out when the sun went down.",
      "THE TRAIL LEADING TO THE \"CANAL KILLER\" BEGINS WITH DNA FROM THE CRIME SCENE",
      "The murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas in the early 1990s created fear in Phoenix that lasted for a generation.",
      "Morgan Loew: They watched the news and read the newspaper every day, hoping that police would make an arrest. And it just kept going on and \u2014 nothing and nothing and nothing.",
      "Investigators had collected matching male DNA from both the victims. But more than two decades passed and the canal murder cases went cold. Then, science finally caught up with the calendar.",
      "Briana Whitney: It's in 2014, Phoenix police detectives are at a DNA conference. \u2026 and a forensic genealogist from California is also at the conference.",
      "Colleen Fitzpatrick, founder of Identifinders International, was there to meet with law enforcement.",
      "Briana Whitney: And she goes up to these detectives, and says, hey, I can take Y chromosomes and create these DNA profiles and try to match \u2026 with genealogy to help solve criminal cases.",
      "Fitzpatrick's company had developed software that could mine public genealogy databases, searching for matches to crime scene DNA. The detectives heard her out.",
      "Colleen Fitzpatrick: And then several weeks later, they sent me the Y-DNA profile \u2026 from the crime scene for the Phoenix canal murders.",
      "Fitzpatrick's company started crunching the data, hoping to provide Phoenix detectives with a name.",
      "Colleen Fitzpatrick: We entered the numbers from the forensic profile into our software. \u2026 That's where I came up with six matches to the name Miller.",
      "While the genetic genealogy search produced the name Miller, it is also one of the most common last names. Detective Schwartzkopf started digging.",
      "Peter Van Sant: You check your files and what do you find?",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: I think there were a total of six Millers that were on what I called my master list. \u2026 And I went down through the list \u2026 got to Bryan Patrick Miller.",
      "But who was Bryan Patrick Miller? Records showed he was 42 years old with a Phoenix address. That name was just one of more than 600 persons of interest who had lived in those case files for years, placed there by a tip. Police at the time seemingly did not pursue Miller.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: We discovered his file downstairs.",
      "Police learned Bryan Miller had a record dating back to before the canal murders. In May 1989, when he was just 16 years old, Miller crossed paths with Celeste Bentley.",
      "Celeste Bentley: I was 24, and I was going to work. \u2026 I had \u2026 just noticed \u2026 a young boy on the bus.",
      "Bentley says she and the boy got off at the same stop. Moments later, she felt something in her     back.",
      "Celeste Bentley: He had ran by me, I thought he had just hit me. \u2026 I just yelled at him. I was like \u2026 \"why \u2014 why'd you do that,\" you know? And then, I reached back and touched my back and realized that it was blood \u2026 I had been stabbed.",
      "With a single knife wound to her upper back, Bentley screamed and managed to make it to the store where she worked. A coworker called for help. About 30 minutes later, when Bentley was in the back of an ambulance \u2014",
      "Celeste Bentley: The police came and said they found him, and they wanted to bring him to the ambulance to show him to me.",
      "Bentley identified her assailant. Bryan Miller was charged with aggravated assault.",
      "Celeste Bentley: They said that if he had held the blade the other way, he would've gone straight through my ribs, and I could have died.",
      "Miller pleaded guilty and was sentenced to juvenile detention until he turned 18. It was a far cry from where Miller's life had begun.",
      "Briana Whitney: He was living in Hawaii for a while as a kid with his mom and his dad. But his dad died early on in a motorcycle accident.",
      "Years later, Miller and his mother Ellen moved to Phoenix.",
      "Briana Whitney: So, for most of his life and early years, it was Bryan Miller and his mom.",
      "While Miller was in juvenile detention, his mother made a disturbing discovery.",
      "Morgan Loew: Bryan Miller's mom was looking through his stuff, and she found a note that he wrote.",
      "The pages detailed a sinister plan: kidnap the girl, tie her up in the truck and cut her clothes off.",
      "Morgan Loew: This note spelled out how he wanted to find, abduct, rape, murder and dismember a young woman. And Bryan's mom was so disturbed by this piece of paper that she took it to Phoenix police.",
      "It was Miller's 18th birthday and he had just been released as an adult.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: She flat out told police at the time that she was really scared for her safety. \u2026 And that she was not going to allow him to come home.",
      "So, after his release, Miller ended up at a Phoenix halfway house. When Schwartzkopf read that note in 2014, he was struck by something.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: There was a lot of things in there that were close or similar to what happened specifically to Angela.",
      "Including a description of decapitating a victim and preserving the head. Phoenix police wanted to locate Miller. Luckily, he was very easy to find.",
      "INVESTIGATORS MEET BRYAN MILLER BUT DISCOVER HE IS THE ZOMBIE HUNTER",
      "In December 2014, Phoenix police continued digging into potential suspect Bryan Miller who they discovered was actually a local celebrity.",
      "Briana Whitney: Everybody at the time in the Phoenix area knew Bryan Patrick Miller as this character called the Zombie Hunter.",
      "Peter Van Sant: The Zombie Hunter. \u2026 Like a comic book character?",
      "Briana Whitney: Yeah, like a comic book character. Like a \u2026 good guy fighting the bad guys.",
      "Miller's alter ego was a costumed figure who participated in parades and festivals around town.",
      "Briana Whitney: He wore this long trench coat with these goggles and helmet and had this large Gatling gun.",
      "And if you're going to hunt zombies, you need a way to get around.",
      "Briana Whitney: He bought \u2026 an old police car and tricked it out \u2026 wrote \"Zombie Hunter\" on it.",
      "Morgan Loew: And it had a full-size zombie mannequin in the back and blood on the side.",
      "Friend Eric Braverman says Miller's zombie hunter persona attracted a big fan base \u2014 including law enforcement officers who lined up to pose with him.",
      "Eric Braverman: Collected pictures of himself with the cops like trophies. \u2026 They're all smiling big with him leaning on the car.",
      "Braverman says Miller's superhero character was the opposite of what Miller was like when he wasn't in costume.",
      "Eric Braverman: He seemed like a harmless marshmallow that was immersed in this goofy lifestyle. \u2026 \u00a0He's just that unassuming guy.",
      "But could Miller be the canal killer? The only way to find out was to get his DNA. Investigators began to surveil Miller, who worked at an Amazon warehouse. Every day when he got there, Miller parked the zombie mobile in the same spot.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: He would come out for his 15-minute break, blast his music really loud. \u2026 Lunchtime came out to the car, same thing. \u2026 Blast this God-awful music.",
      "Schwartzkopf came up with an elaborate plan to get his DNA.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: I went up and introduced myself to Miller. He was in his car.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What did you introduce yourself as?",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: I introduced myself as a security consultant.",
      "Schwartzkopf told Miller that thieves had been stealing goods from a warehouse across the way.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: I said, \"would you be interested in working for me as a security officer watching the building while you're outside?\"",
      "Peter Van Sant: Did his eyes light up?",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: Yeah, because it was a good paying job. I said, look\u2014\"I'll pay you 20 bucks an hour.\"",
      "On Jan. 2, 2015, Schwartzkopf met Miller at a Chili's restaurant to fill out a job application. The cold case unit was behind the scenes ready to bag anything that had Miller's DNA on it, such as utensils or a glass.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: They set a table for me and Mr. Miller away from everybody else in a part of the restaurant where nobody else is at.",
      "Miller arrived with a surprise guest \u2014 his 15-year-old daughter, Sarah. Miller was a divorced, single dad.",
      "Eric Braverman: He was very gentle in caring about his daughter. He often brought his daughter \u2026 where he would be going.",
      "The trio sat down and ordered hamburgers. When the food arrived \u2014",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: He swallows his hamburger, in like, five bites. \u2026 Won't take a drink of his water. And I'm sitting there going, \"Are you sure you \u2026 don't want \u2026 something else to drink? You just got water.\" \"No, no, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.\"",
      "Schwartzkopf started to worry this operation would be a bust.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And what does he finally do that makes this mission accomplished?",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: He finally took a drink from the water glass \u2026 That's when I knew that, OK, now we've at least got his DNA.",
      "Despite knowing about Miller's juvenile record, as their meal ended, the veteran detective's gut told him Miller was not their man.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: Seeing him with his daughter. \u2026 I just don't see this guy as being the monster in 1992 and '93 that would do this to these women.",
      "Miller gave Schwartzkopf a quick tour of his Zombie Hunter mobile, and the two parted ways with the detective saying he'd be in touch. The cold case unit sent Miller's water glass off to the crime lab.",
      "Eleven days later, Schwartzkopf says there was a call from the lab.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: And we're sitting there and we're like, \"what is this all about?\"",
      "Briana Whitney: And in this meeting, these Phoenix detectives say, as a joke, \"Huh, they must have solved the canal murders.\"",
      "But Detective Schwartzkopf says it was no joke when the head of the lab arrived.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: She leans down to me, she goes, \"It's him.\" I go \"What?\" She goes, \"Bryan Miller, it's him.\" \u2026 Well, the blood rushed from my head. \u2026 I kind of sat back and I went, \"You've gotta be kidding.\"",
      "Bryan Miller's DNA from that water glass matched the DNA recovered from Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas more than 20 years before. Miller was arrested within hours. During a police interview shortly after, Miller was told why he'd been taken into custody in connection with the canal murders.",
      "DETECTIVE: We have DNA that links you to those two ladies.",
      "BRYAN MILLER: I don't see how that's possible.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: He just kind of \u2026 went through it in his dopey kind of, I don't know what you're kind of talking about.",
      "DETECTIVE: Would help you get it off your chest if you did something like that.",
      "BRYAN MILLER: I didn't kill anyone.",
      "DETECTIVE: You didn't kill anybody?",
      "BRYAN MILLER: No.",

      "Morgan Loew: Bryan Miller's house was like it came from the show \"Hoarders.\"",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: There was a little pass where you could get to a bathroom and the kitchen and where the TV was, and that's it. Everything else is just stacked to the roof with garbage.",

      "Clark Schwartzkopf: Not only madness, I go, \"This is a nightmare.\"",
      "Schwartzkopf and his investigators would have to sift through all of it looking for other possible evidence. Detective Schwartzkopf also focused on a new source \u2014 someone Miller himself had ominously singled out in his interview.",

      "In January 2015, more than 21 years after the canal murders, Bryan Miller was charged with first-degree murder in both Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas' deaths. Melanie's friend Rachel Schepemaker says she felt a wave of relief.",
      "Rachel Schepemaker: A very joyous moment of \"Oh my gosh, this is what we've been waiting for, for decades upon decades.\"",
      "Detective Schwartzkopf wanted to talk to the one person who probably knew Miller best, his ex-wife Amy.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: They had been married for eight years. There was a divorce.",
      "Amy told Schwartzkopf that she was just 19 when she met Bryan Miller in 1996. They married less than a year later and moved to Everett, Washington. Amy had a shocking revelation for the detective. She told Schwartzkopf Miller had revealed a gruesome secret to her: that he had killed a young girl in Phoenix years earlier, before he'd ever met Amy. Schwartzkopf says Amy never reported it to police before for a number of reasons; she didn't know if it was true, she was afraid of Miller and she said she wanted to be a good wife.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: You support your man no matter what.",
      "Detective Schwartzkopf says Amy told him what Miller had said.",
      "Clark Schwartzkopf: That a young girl had come to his door. \u2026 That he had grabbed this young female, pulled her in, killed her immediately.",
      "Amy said Miller told her he dismembered the girl and disposed of her remains in trash left on the curb. Although Amy claimed Miller never told her the child's name, investigators used the information Amy provided to piece together who Miller may have been talking about.",
      "Briana Whitney: Thirteen-year-old Brandy Myers was a little girl collecting money for a school book-a-thon in her north Phoenix neighborhood, going door to door.",

      "Kristin Dennis: She was last seen two doors down from Bryan's \u2026 walking in the direction of his house.",

      "Her sister believes that as well.",
      "Kristin Dennis: Brandy went to the landfill ... like something of no importance.",
      "Even with Amy's account, investigators did not have enough evidence to charge Miller in Brandy's disappearance.",

      "Ruiz-Ramirez said she escaped and contacted police. They picked up Miller shortly after. He didn't deny stabbing Ruiz-Ramirez, but claimed it was self-defense. He said he was at work when Ruiz-Ramirez walked in off the street and asked to make a call.",

      "Morgan Loew: They had to concede right off the bat that he is the actual killer, but that he was not guilty by reason of insanity.",
      "His defense attorneys say Miller was tortured by his mother Ellen as a child, and that led to his violent sexual behavior. She died in 2010.",
      "Morgan Loew: If you imagine the making of a monster, this is kind of the household \u2026 that story begins in.",
      "Miller told investigators after his arrest that the beatings began when he was just 5 years old.",
      "Morgan Loew: She was a detention officer. Discipline in their house was mental as well as physical.",
      "BRYAN MILLER (to detective): She used her security belt, and it was like a law enforcement belt, and usually I got hit by the buckle.",
      "The defense opted for a bench trial, which meant there would be no jury. His lawyers told Judge Suzanne Cohen that Miller's mother also exposed her young son to violent sexual content.",
      "Morgan Loew: He was exposed to her interests in pornography and extremely violent films.",
      "Miller's lawyers said his mother's abuse caused Miller to develop severe mental health problems.",
      "Bethany Brand: He feels like there are different TVs playing in his head.",
      "Psychologist Bethany Brand testified that Miller developed a condition known as dissociative amnesia \u2014 an inability to remember some traumatic events. Morgan Loew summed up the defense argument.",
      "Morgan Loew: There were two Bryans. There's the one you see over there at the defense table, who's a fairly normal person who has friends, who had a job, who was a dad, who was a husband. \u2026 And then there's the killer. There's bad Bryan.",
      "And Miller, claimed his attorneys, had no memory\u2014none\u2014of the two murders he was charged with.",
      "Prosecutors undermine the defense claim that Miller has no memory of the killings. They point out that he remembers details related to other stabbings.",
      "Remember, Miller admitted stabbing Celeste Bentley when he was 16 years old, and in 2002 he had also testified about the stabbing of Melissa Ruiz-Ramirez in Washington.",
      "To show Miller's deviant side, prosecutors called the only person in the world Miller said he despised: his ex-wife Amy. The judge did not allow cameras to record her face. Under questioning by prosecutor Elizabeth Reamer, Amy testified that later in their marriage, Miller grew increasingly violent during sex.",
      "ELIZABETH REAMER: Did you ever say anything to him about wanting it to stop because it was scary?",
      "AMY MILLER: No.",
      "ELIZABETH REAMER: Why not?",
      "AMY MILLER: I was avoiding any confrontation with him at all at that point and (sighs) wanted to be as compliant as possible so that I would say, will he love me enough not to kill me?",
      "ELIZABETH REAMER: Did he ask permission prior to using needles on you?",
      "AMY MILLER: No.",
      "ELIZABETH REAMER: Did he ask permission prior to tying you up?",
      "AMY MILLER: No.",
      "ELIZABETH REAMER: What percentage of your sex life after he got out of jail in Washington included bondage, the pins or other things that were not the normal sex you'd been having early in your marriage?",
      "AMY MILLER: Probably at least 95 percent.",
      "The trial continued and after 6 months and 36 witnesses, the judge delivered her verdict.",
      "JUDGE COHEN:\u00a0 As to count one, first-degree murder Angela Brosso is as follows: guilty. \u2026 As to count two, first-degree murder victim Melanie Bernas as follows: guilty.",
      "Peter Van Sant: How did Bryan Miller react to the guilty verdict?",
      "Morgan Loew: He didn't react. \u2026 He didn't give any real emotion.",
      "But Angela's mother, who addressed the court remotely, was emotional.",
      "LINDA BROSSO STROCK: The defendant broke my heart \u2026 took all hope and light from me and my family. The hole in my heart is so big and empty.",
      "Melanie's older sister Jill Bernas also spoke remotely about how painful it was that Melanie's life ended violently at the age of 17.",
      "JILL BERNAS CANETTA: For 30 years now, we've had to live without Melanie because the defendant murdered her \u2026 Words cannot even begin to describe the level of excruciating pain we experienced with the news of her horrific death.",
      "Miller\u2014who didn't take the stand during his trial\u2014was allowed to give a statement before he was sentenced.",
      "BRYAN MILLER: I am not looking for sympathy today. This time is for the family and friends of the victims. I cannot imagine what pain they have endured for all these years. \u2026 I know I am different. \u2026 I thought it had to do with what my mother did to me.",
      "Defense counsel RJ Parker urged Judge Cohen to show mercy before she delivered her judgement on Miller's sentence, life in prison or death.",
      "RJ PARKER: You do not have to kill Bryan in order to see justice done.",
      "Judge Cohen agreed with the centerpiece of the defense case.",
      "JUDGE COHEN: The defendant's abuse as a child was proven.",
      "But eight months after the trial began, Miller's abuse at the hands of his mother did not dissuade Judge Cohen from handing down the ultimate sentence.",
      "JUDGE COHEN: There is no question that what the defendant did deserves the death penalty.",
      "JUDGE COHEN: Mr. Miller, anything you wish to say to the court?",
      "BRYAN MILLER: I guess, thanks for, uh, listening to everything that was said and giving us at least the opportunity to try and convince you otherwise.",
      "Det. Clark Schwartzkopf: Justice was carried out in this case.",
      "Detective Schwartzkopf hopes family and friends of Angela and Melanie might finally find some peace \u2014 people like Melanie's friend Rachael Schepemaker.",
      "Rachel Schepemaker: Just knowing that justice was served \u2026 it doesn't make anything easier.",
      "Peter Van Sant: How do you want your good friend to be remembered?",
      "Rachel Schepemaker: Just that she's the all-American good kid.",
      "Rachel Schepemaker: I want her family to know that we haven't forgotten her \u2026 She changed us all for the better \u2026 She was a gift.",
      "Under Arizona law, Bryan Miller's death sentence will be automatically appealed.",

    "published": "Sat, 16 Aug 2025 09:39:06 -0400",
    "summary": "As less young people meet major economic milestones such as moving out and getting married, the concept of adulthood is changing.",
    "story": [
      "Fewer young adults are achieving economic and family milestones typically associated with adulthood, according to a recent working\u00a0paper\u00a0from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "The paper looked at nationally representative data from 2005 and 2023 to examine changes in young adults' experiences reaching major life events, such as moving out of their parents' house, getting married, and having a child. Researchers found a dramatic shift in the attainment of these milestones in recent decades.",
      "The reason for this, according to the paper, is that more young adults between the ages of 25 and 34 are facing economic barriers compared with previous generations. Changing societal attitudes around family formation are also contributing to the sharp decline in the share of young people reaching what the U.S. Census Bureau considers to be \"key milestones.\"",
      "According to the working paper, \"Changes in Milestones of Adulthood,\" almost half of all young adults in 1975 had reached four milestones associated with adulthood: moving out of one's parents' home, getting a job, getting married and having a child.",
      "Five decades on, that progression has changed dramatically. The share of young adults that have followed the traditional pathway to adulthood has dropped to less than a quarter, according to the paper.",
      "\"...Living arrangements, economic opportunities and attitudes toward family formation have not been experienced in the same fashion across generations of young adults,\" the working paper reads. \"Increases in job turbulence and economic downturns, for example, have resulted in some young adults navigating more volatile and uncertain economic environments.\"",
      "Economic conditions, combined with changing cultural norms, \"have implications for how young people develop their identity as adults,\" the paper states.",
      "This redefinition of young adulthood comes as the cost of everyday essentials, including housing, food, gas and daycare rises. As a result, more Americans are choosing to forego having a family, in some cases because they deem such choices unaffordable, the study finds.",
      "Researchers measured changes in the achievement of individual milestones, too. While one-quarter of young adults achieved all four milestones, 28% met two economic milestones \u2014 moving out of their parents' homes and finding jobs.",
      "Women in the workforce",
      "In the 1970s, getting married, having a child, and living independently, were the second-most common group of milestones young people achieved, next to the completion of all four.",
      "Women's gains in the workforce, along with changing cultural attitudes, however, have led this combination of milestones to become less popular, the report notes.",
      "The completion of education, another marker of adulthood, has overshadowed other milestones over the years as an increasing number of young adults enroll in college, according to the paper.",
      "\"These higher levels of educational attainment result in contemporary cohorts spending a longer portion of their young adult lives enrolled in higher education, potentially delaying other markers of adulthood such as entering the labor force or marriage,\" the working paper states.",
      "When it comes to perceptions of adulthood, having a job takes precedence over marriage, as young adults see economic achievements as more directly tied to adulthood than they do committing to a spouse.",
      "\"Marriage is increasingly viewed as a capstone of adulthood, something to pursue after achieving economic stability through completing formal education, establishing an independent household and becoming employed,\" the working paper states.",

    "story": [
      "Depending on the items you choose, your child's lunch sandwich could cost more this school year than it did in 2024.",
      "That's according to a new report from Deloitte that shows the overall cost of homemade lunches is on the rise. The average cost for a packed lunch is now $6.15, according to Deloitte, up nearly 3% from $5.99 last year. Just under half of the parents polled by the survey said they expect their child's lunch to cost more this September than it did in 2024.",
      "The reason for the price increase, as the Deloitte report points out, is because the cost of groceries has climbed in recent years. Parents are now paying more for staples like whole milk, which is up 7.8% from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data for July, as well as for bananas, which are up 7.2%.",
      "The Consumer Price Index report for July, released earlier this week by the BLS, shows\u00a0that overall grocery prices are up 2.2% compared with last year.",
      "Some foods are cheaper",
      "Not all food prices have gone up; in fact, some food items are cheaper this year. In terms of specific lunch items, CBS' price tracker shows that the cost of white bread is actually 6% lower than it was in 2024.",

      "In response to their anticipation of higher lunch prices, caregivers plan to switch from name brands to store brands, choose cheaper sandwich options, and cut down in other household expenses to free up more cash for groceries, according to Deloitte's survey, which polled 1,203 caregivers of school-aged children.",
      "Frugal food shopping in the U.S. has \"generally been on an upward trend since October 2024,\" the report found, though it is still lower today than its peak in 2023.",
      "Cafeteria lunch crunch",
      "It's not just brown bag lunches that could end up costing families more. Cafeteria lunches, which tend to be cheaper than brown bag lunches, could also see a price hike this year.",
      "According to Tuesday's CPI data, the price of food at elementary and secondary schools is up 3.3% since July of last year. To account for inflation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month that it would funnel more money into the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs \u2014 which provide healthy, low-cost or free meals to children.",
      "To be sure, not everyone will end up paying full price for cafeteria school lunches. In Deloitte's survey, more than half of respondents said their school offers free lunch, regardless of income.",
      "School meal prices range from $2.95 for elementary school to $3.20 for high school a\u00a0survey\u00a0conducted by School Nutrition Association found.",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 15:07:12 -0400",
    "summary": "Erin is the first hurricane to develop over the Atlantic this year, and meteorologists are closely tracking its path and forecast.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Erin further weakened to a Category 3 storm early Sunday morning as it churned over the Atlantic Ocean north of the Caribbean. Forecasters with the National Hurricane Center in Miami later said the storm is \"likely to strengthen again.\"",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, exploded to Category 5 on Saturday before weakening, with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph as of Sunday. The storm's center was about 235 miles north of San Juan, Puerto Rico and about 200 miles east of the Grand Turk Island, moving west-northwest at 13 mph.",
      "Still a major storm, a\u00a0Category 3 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds near 125 mph with higher gusts.",
      "Erin is expected to remain powerful for the next several days, forecasters said. The National Hurricane Center's latest update at 2 p.m. Sunday said the central Bahamas, the North Carolina Outer Banks and Bermuda should monitor the progress of Erin as the storm is likely to remain a dangerous major hurricane through the middle of this week.",
      "\"You're dealing with a major hurricane. The intensity is fluctuating. It's a dangerous hurricane in any event,\" said Richard Pasch of the National Hurricane Center.",
      "While Erin's maximum winds diminished, the storm's overall size grew. A tropical storm warning was issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands, as well as the southeastern region of the Bahamas, and winds and heavy rains are whipping the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.",
      "A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, and in this case, within 24 hours, the NHC said. Heavy rain is still expected across the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, with rainfall of 3 to 6 inches, with 8 inches in some isolated areas.",
      "Swells were also expected to affect portions of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and the Turks and Caicos Islands during the next couple of days, the NHC reported.",
      "The storm wasn't expected to directly impact the U.S. East Coast, but by doubling or tripling in size, it could bring rip currents all along the Southeast coast. Gusty winds and flooding tides could wash out parts of the highway that connects the North Carolina Outer Banks by midweek, the National Weather Service said.",
      "What is an eyewall replacement cycle?",
      "The hurricane center disclosed Saturday night that Erin was undergoing an \"eyewall replacement cycle,\" which, according to CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan, is when the storm has become so significantly powerful that its eyewall, its strongest part, reaches maximum strength.",
      "When this happens, Nolan said, the eyewall itself becomes so intense from intaking the available energy from its environment that a new eyewall will begin to build on the outside of the existing, inner eyewall. Once the new eyewall is created, it cuts off the fuel to the original eyewall.",
      "Furthermore, as the new eyewall gains strength to keep up with the power of the storm, the radius of the eye itself will become much larger than it originally was, Nolan said.",
      "This process may cause the storm to weaken temporarily, and its wind speeds may slow as it regains strength.",
      "According to Nolan, however, after this process, the storm could emerge even stronger than it was before.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "Erin's path continued to curve northward, with the center of the hurricane passing just to the north of the northern Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico.",
      "The northern Leewards stretch from the Virgin Islands to Guadeloupe and include St. Martin, St. Barts and other islands.",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of the forecast models shows the storm skirting the Caribbean islands and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it moves north.",
      "A high-pressure system in the Atlantic was expected to steer Erin away from the Eastern Seaboard while a cold front was also forecast to push the hurricane offshore, CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Jessica Burch reported.",

But \"there's no deal until there's a deal,\" he said, and no ceasefire was announced.",
      "Rubio, who attended the summit, was thin on details Sunday, saying that \"there are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs.\" He added that the details would be discussed with Zelenskyy and other European leaders on Monday as the administration works to \"narrow the gap between the two sides.\"",
      "\"We have to make enough progress so that we can sit down President Zelenskyy and President Putin in the same place, which is what President Zelenskyy has been asking for, and reach a final agreement that ends this war,\" Rubio said, noting that there were \"some concepts and ideas discussed\" with Putin that they expect the Ukrainians would support.",
      "When asked whether the U.S. would demand Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory as part of an agreement, the secretary of state acknowledged that both sides would have to make concessions in order to reach a deal to end the conflict.",

      "\"I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement,\" Rubio added. \"Enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"",
      "Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, appeared on \"Face the Nation\" after Rubio, and called the meeting with Putin a \"historic embarrassment\" while outlining what he says is needed to end the war.",
      "\"In any negotiation, when you're trying to end an armed conflict, there's nothing more important than understanding what motivates your adversary, what is making Vladimir Putin tick, in this instance,\" Crow said.",

The circumstances around each death are under investigation.",

Police said an initial report suggested the man lost consciousness while snorkeling at a beach, and a lifeguard pulled him from the water to administer CPR. The man, reported to be an American national, was ultimately pronounced dead by a doctor, according to police.",
      "Officers later found a 74-year-old woman unresponsive on board a separate commercial ship. The initial police report in that incident suggested that the woman, also reported to be American, lost consciousness while swimming in a pool. Similar to the first case, police said a lifeguard pulled her from the water and attempted CPR before she was also pronounced dead.",

      "\"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" He added that it \"was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that\" and called them \"game-changing.\"",
      "Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.",
      "Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.",

      "Witkoff defended Mr. Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which the president had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.",
      "\"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal,\" Witkoff said, without elaborating. \"We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal.\"",
      "Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.",
      "\"If he did this now, the moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks,\" Rubio said. \"We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again. That's the goal here.\"",
      "Rubio said that Kyiv \"is going to have to accept things, but they're going to have to get things too.\"",
      "\"For example, Ukraine is a sovereign country.

Today, we stop everything to remember the supreme value of the sanctity of life,\" said Anat Angrest, mother of hostage Matan Angrest. \"Today, we stop everything to join hands \u2014 right, left, center and everything in between.\"",
      "Protesters at highway intersections handed out yellow ribbons, the symbol that represents the hostages, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which organized the stoppage, said.",
      "Even though Israel's largest labor union, Histadrut, ultimately did not join Sunday's action, strikes of this magnitude are relatively rare in Israel. Many businesses and municipalities decided independently to strike.",
      "Still, an end to the conflict does not appear near. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded the immediate release of the hostages but is balancing competing pressures, haunted by the potential for mutiny within his coalition.",
      "Israeli leaders criticize demonstrations",
      "Netanyahu addressed the protests on Sunday at a cabinet meeting, saying they were benefiting Hamas.",
      "\"Those who are calling today for an end to the war without Hamas' elimination are not only hardening Hamas' position and delaying the release of our hostages, they are also ensuring that the horrors of October 7 will repeat themselves and that we will have to fight an endless war,\" the prime minister said.",
      "Far-right members of his cabinet insist they won't support any deal that allows Hamas to retain power. The last time Israel agreed to a ceasefire that released hostages, they threatened to topple Netanyahu's government.",
      "Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Sunday called the stoppage \"a bad and harmful campaign that plays into Hamas' hands, buries the hostages in the tunnels and attempts to get Israel to surrender to its enemies and jeopardize its security and future.\"",
      "National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, in a statement, accused protesters of trying to \"weaken Israel.\" Like Smotrich, he said the strike \"strengthens Hamas and delays the return of the hostages.\"",
      "Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry reported that 47 people were killed and at least 226 were wounded across the territory in the last 24 hours alone. Meanwhile, hospitals and eyewitnesses in Gaza reported at least 17 aid-seekers had been killed by Israeli forces on Sunday, including nine awaiting aid trucks close to the Morag corridor. The death toll among Palestinians waiting for food and other aid in Gaza has climbed this summer, sparking outcry around the world as\u00a0starvation and malnutrition run rampant in the enclave.",
      "Hamza Asfour said he was just north of the corridor, awaiting a convoy, when Israeli snipers fired, first to disperse the crowds, then from tanks hundreds of meters away.",
      "He saw two people with gunshot wounds \u2014 one in the chest and other in the shoulder.",
      "\"It's either to take this risk or wait and see my family die of starvation,\" he said. \"There is no other option.\"",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which runs the distribution points, said there was no gunfire Sunday \"at or near\" its sites, which sit at the end of aid truck routes.",
      "Israel's military did not immediately respond to questions about strikes in the three areas.",
      "Israel's air and ground war has already killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza and displaced most of the population. The United Nations is warning that levels of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at their highest since the war began.",
      "The Hamas-led attack in 2023 killed around 1,200 people in Israel. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed 61,897 people in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry, which does not specify how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children.",
      "2 more children die from malnutrition-related causes",
      "On Sunday, two children died of malnutrition-related causes in Gaza, bringing the death toll from such causes over the last 24 hours to seven, according to Gaza's health ministry. The total number of deaths related to starvation has risen to 251, including 110 children, said the health ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.",
      "While demonstrators in Israel demanded a ceasefire, Israel began preparing for an invasion of Gaza City and other populated parts of the besieged strip, aimed at destroying Hamas.",
      "The military body that coordinates its humanitarian aid to Gaza said Sunday that the supply of tents to the territory would resume. COGAT said it would allow the United Nations to resume importing tents and shelter equipment into Gaza ahead of plans to forcibly evacuate people from combat zones \"for their protection.\"",
      "The majority of assistance has been blocked from entering Gaza since Israel imposed a total blockade in March after a ceasefire collapsed when Israel restarted its offensive. Deliveries have since partially resumed, though aid organizations say the flow is far below what is needed. Some have accused Israel of \"weaponizing aid\" through blockades and rules they say turn humanitarian assistance into a tool of its political and military goals.",
      "Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen's capital on Sunday, escalating strikes on Iran-backed Houthis, who, since the war began, have fired missiles at Israel and targeted ships in the Red Sea.",
      "Both the IDF and a Houthi-run television station in Yemen announced the strikes. Al-Masirah Television said they targeted a power plant in the southern district of Sanhan, sparking a fire and knocking it out of service, the Yemeni station said. Israel's military said Sunday's strikes targeted energy infrastructure it claimed was being used by the Houthis, and were launched in response to missiles and drones aimed at Israel.",
      "While some projectiles have breached its missile defenses \u2014 notably during its 12-day war with Iran in June \u2014 Israel has intercepted the vast majority of missiles launched from Yemen.",

      "Some humanitarian groups have condemned the pause because those visas may be issued to people in need of medical treatment abroad, CBS News partner BBC News reported.",
      "The nonprofit organization Palestine Children's Relief Fund said in a statement to BBC News that the decision \"will have a devastating and irreversible impact on our ability to bring injured and critically ill children from Gaza to the United States for lifesaving medical treatment.\"",

      "Jing's death occurred several weeks after German mountaineer and two-time Olympic gold medalist Laura Dahlmeir died while attempting to summit Laila Peak in the Karakoram mountain range. Efforts to retrieve her body were abandoned when Dahlmeier's family informed authorities that she had stated that no one should risk their life to recover her body if she died in any accident.",

    "story": [
      "Air Canada\u00a0and its striking flight attendants were forced back to work and into arbitration Saturday by Canada's government after an early morning strike stranded more than 100,000 travelers around the world during the peak summer travel season.",
      "Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu said now is not the time to take risks with the economy while announcing the intervention. It means the 10,000 flight attendants will return to work soon.",
      "\"The talks broke down. It is clear that the parties are not any closer to resolving some of the key issues that remain and they will need help with the arbitrator,\" Hajdu said.",
      "Hajdu said the full resumption of services could take days, noting it is up to the Canada Industrial Relations Board.",
      "Earlier Saturday, the airline suspended all operations as more than 10,000 of the airline's flight attendants went on strike after a deadline to reach a deal passed. Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day.",
      "\"We are now officially on strike! Picket lines will be active at all bases,\" the Canadian Union of Public Employees said in a statement.",
      "It is the first strike by flight attendants since 1985.",
      "\"The Liberals have talked out of both sides of their mouths. They said the best place for this is at the bargaining table. They refused to correct this historic injustice through legislation,\" said Wesley Lesosky, President of the Air Canada Component of the Canadian Union of Public Employees.",
      "\"Now, when we're at the bargaining table with an obstinate employer, the Liberals are violating our Charter rights to take job action and give Air Canada exactly what they want \u2014 hours and hours of unpaid labour from underpaid flight attendants, while the company pulls in sky-high profits and extraordinary executive compensation,\" Lesosky said in a statement.",
      "A bitter contract fight between Canada's largest airline and the union representing 10,000 of its flight attendants escalated Friday as the union turned down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which would eliminate its right to strike and allow a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "Flight attendants walked off the job around 1 a.m. EDT on Saturday. Around the same time, Air Canada said it would begin locking flight attendants out of airports.",
      "Hugh Pouliot, the spokesman for the union, earlier said the union had a meeting with Hajdu and representatives from Air Canada earlier Friday evening.",
      "\"CUPE has engaged with the mediator to relay our willingness to continue bargaining \u2014 despite the fact that Air Canada has not countered our last two offers since Tuesday,\" he said in an email. \"We're here to bargain a deal, not to go on strike.\"",

      "\"It didn't go over well with the line. Nobody really seemed interested, everybody seemed a little bit amused almost at the suggestion, or exasperated, because it is a bit ridiculous to offer to take stranded passengers to a different country to strand them there,\" she said.",
      "Montreal resident Alex Laroche, 21, and his girlfriend had been saving for their European vacation since Christmas. Now their $8,000 trip with nonrefundable lodging is on the line as they wait to hear from Air Canada about the fate of their Saturday night flight to Nice, France.",
      "Laroche said he considered booking new flights with a different carrier, but he said most of them are nearly full and cost more than double the $3,000 they paid for their original tickets.",
      "\"At this point, it's just a waiting game,\" he said.",
      "Laroche said he was initially upset over the union's decision to go on strike, but that he had a change of heart after reading about the key issues at the center of the contract negotiations, including the issue of wages.",
      "\"Their wage is barely livable,\" Laroche said.",
      "The airline said it would also offer alternative travel options through other Canadian and foreign airlines when possible. But it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full \"due to the summer travel peak.\"",
      "\"Air Canada is strongly advising affected customers not to go to the airport unless they have a confirmed ticket on an airline other than Air Canada or Air Canada Rouge,\" the airline said in a statement. \"Air Canada deeply regrets the effect the strike is having on customers.\"",
      "Canada is the second-largest country in the world and flying is often the only viable way to travel around the nation. The government forced the country's two major railroads into arbitration with their labor union last year during a work stoppage. The union for the rail workers is suing, arguing the government is removing a union's leverage in negotiations.",
      "The Business Council of Canada has urged the government to impose binding arbitration in this case, too.",
      "In anticipation of the strike, the airline began cancelling flights on Thursday and Friday as flight attendants did not report to work.",

Mr. Trump said the meeting with Putin \"went very well.\" He also said the meeting was followed by a \"late night phone call\" with Zelenskyy and other European leaders, including Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO. The call took place around 2:40 a.m. ET.",
      "\"It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump did not share any details of the agreement. Diplomatic sources told CBS News that Mr. Trump said that Putin would make some concessions, but failed to specify what that might mean.",
      "In his first remarks since Friday's summit, Putin said the visit to Alaska was \"timely and very useful\" and that addressing the \"root causes\" of the war \"should be the basis of a settlement.\"",
      "\"We have not had direct negotiations of this kind at this level for a long time. I repeat: there was an opportunity calmly, in detail once again to express our position,\" Putin said, according to a transcript of a meeting with senior Russian officials released by Kremlin. \"We, of course, respect the position of the U.S. administration, which sees a need for an early cessation of hostilities. Well, we would also like to resolve all issues by peaceful means. The conversation was very frank, informative, and I think it brings us closer to the right decisions.\"",
      "European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, said in a statement that they had been debriefed on the meeting with Putin, and said Mr. Trump had supported security guarantees for Ukraine. The guarantees would allow Ukraine to \"effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" the statement said.",

      "Zelenskyy has previously supported a ceasefire agreement to meet and discuss a peace agreement, but Moscow has rejected the idea. He has also criticized any talks that take place without Ukraine.",
      "\"If it all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Potentially, millions of people's lives will be saved.\"",
      "First Lady Melania Trump on Friday also\u00a0wrote a letter to Putin, saying he can \"singlehandedly restore\" children's laughter. Attorney General Pam Bondi posted the letter on social media Saturday.",
      "\"In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone \u2014 you serve humanity itself,\" the letter said, in part. \"Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr. Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today. It is time.\"",
      "Zelenskyy previously joined Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance in the Oval Office in March, but the gathering quickly descended into insults and chaos.",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with Putin in Anchorage on Friday ended without a ceasefire or peace deal. In brief remarks after the leaders' nearly three-hour meeting, Putin alluded to \"unspecified agreements,\" but no further details were given. Mr. Trump said the meeting had been \"extremely productive.\" Neither leader mentioned an end to the fighting in Ukraine.",
      "The summit, which included a red carpet and military flyover, ended early without a planned luncheon between a broader group of officials. Mr. Trump returned to Washington, D.C. overnight.",
      "In a taped conversation with Fox News' Sean Hannity before he departed from Alaska, Mr. Trump said he believes Putin wants the war to end and that the nations are close to a deal, and added that it's \"really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done.\" He did not specify what an agreement might look like.",
      "Zelenskyy has said in the past that he will never agree to any formal Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory or abandon the country's bid for NATO membership. Meanwhile, Putin has been\u00a0unwavering in his demand to keep all Ukrainian territory that his forces occupy and prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, with the long-term goal of returning it to Moscow's sphere of influence.",
      "Diplomatic sources expressed concern to CBS that Mr. Trump had dropped his ceasefire demand and feared that the U.S. president and Putin may have come to an agreement on deal terms that they may try to force on Ukraine. The sources said that European leaders are trying to show unity with Zelenskyy to push back.",
      "Mr. Trump has called ending the war in Ukraine and Russia a top priority for his administration. He previously said he would end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office in January. He has criticized both Putin and Zelenskyy for failing to end the conflict. In recent months, he has appeared to become frustrated with Putin,\u00a0giving several ultimatums and criticizing the Russian leader for the violence against civilians in Ukraine amid ongoing conversations with the U.S.",
      "\"I always hang up, [and] say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call,'\" Mr. Trump said in July. \"And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city, and I say, 'That's strange.' And after that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything.\"",

      "\"I couldn't believe I'd found something so quickly into my first ever excavation,\" Souza said in a press release. \"After I'd had to miss Birdoswald last year, it was amazing to discover something that hasn't been seen for more than a thousand years, I was really geeking out over it.\"",

      "According to the university, the early medieval object \u2013 about 1.5 inches long with a decorative finial at one end \u2013 was buried close to the route of Dere Street, a major Roman road which ran between York, England and Edinburgh, Scotland. Dere Street was still used after the fall of the Roman Empire and went on to become part of the modern-day A68 highway.",
      "The archaeology students, alongside archaeologists from North East Museums, were investigating the location as it was the site of a chance discovery of a similar object in 2021.",
      "\"This is an exciting find of exceptional quality,\" said Newcastle University archaeology professor James Gerrard. \"We know that Dere Street continued to be a major thoroughfare long after the Romans and it's clear from this discovery that high status people were using it.\"",
      "According to the university, gold was considered high status and was only used by the elite. Experts involved in the excavation believe the object found by Souza and the one discovered in 2021 could have had a religious or ceremonial use.",
      "\"It is possible that this pair of objects may have been deliberately buried,\" Gerrad added.",

      "What is endometriosis?",
      "Endometriosis affects roughly 10 percent of reproductive-aged women worldwide; in the U.S. alone, it impacts about 9 million women.

      "BINDI IRWIN'S EMERGENCY SURGERY TOOK UNEXPECTED TURN FORCING HER TO MISS STEVE IRWIN GALA",
      "When treatment doesn\u2019t help symptoms, the next step is often laparoscopic surgery, which uses small incisions to remove or ablate lesions.",
      "This surgery often means a faster recovery and fewer complications compared to more invasive open surgery, called a laparotomy, which involves one long incision across the abdomen.",
      "Surgeries to remove lesions may help improve fertility in some women. (iStock)",
      "Recovery typically takes two to four weeks, though healing may take longer depending on the extent of surgery and individual health.",

      "Fox News Digital spoke to Just Facts President James Agresti about misleading narratives about crime in the nation\u2019s capital",
      "Democrats across the country have been pushing back on President Trump\u2019s D.C. crime crackdown, citing statistics purportedly showing that crime in the nation\u2019s capital is down or even at historic lows, but an expert who spoke to Fox News Digital is pushing back on that narrative.",
      "\"These Democrats are citing statistics from the FBI, from its uniform crime report. And the problem with that is that they're portraying it as if it's a record of violent crime,\" Jim Agresti, president of the nonprofit research institute Just Facts, told Fox News Digital shortly after Trump announced he was sending federal resources to the nation\u2019s capital to confront crime in the city.",
      "\"But really what it is is a record of crimes that are reported to the police and then those of those crimes that get reported to the FBI. It's not a full record of all violent crimes, and this is a problem. And the FBI is very explicit about this when they present the data in their formal report every year, where they say, \u2018Do not directly compare the data from year to year because there are differences in how frequently people report crimes and how frequently the FBI gets that data from the local police agencies.\u2019\"",
      "While many prominent Democrats, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, have insisted violent crime is at a 30-year low in the city, Agresti told Fox News Digital the \"best way to understand the state of violent crime\" in any jurisdiction is to look at the number of murders because it is a violent crime that is difficult to \"sweep under the rug\" because it \"produces a dead body.\"",

      "Fox News Digital spoke to Just Facts President Jim Agresti about the crime situation in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 (Getty)",
      "\"When we look at the murder data for DC, we see that it is not a situation that is lower now than it's been in the last 30 years. Quite the opposite,\" Agresti explained. \"It is currently 83% higher than it was at its low point a dozen years ago. So, there is a serious problem with serious crime, violent crime in D.C., and the city now, the nation's capital, has a murder rate that is five times the U.S. average.\"",
      "The chances of a person facing a violent crime in\u00a0Washington, D.C., have dropped in recent years, but the possibility of dying during such a crime has skyrocketed, data shows, Fox News Digital\u00a0reported on Wednesday.",
      "Lethality in D.C. jumped by a whopping 341% when compared to 2012 data, the study found, reporting that there were 13 homicides per 1,000 serious violent crimes in 2012 and 57 homicides per 1,000 serious violent crimes in 2024.",
      "Agresti explained that while many people operate with the belief that crime spiked across the country during and because of COVID, the issue actually began getting worse specifically when the Black Lives Matter rioting erupted.",

      "\"That makes a lot of sense,\" Agresti said. \"Police were vilified. They pulled back out of fear of being hurt. People were talking about defunding the police, and there was overall mayhem in this country. So, that rise, by the way, that people blame on COVID actually didn't start with COVID, and it didn't appear in other countries. It happened here where we had these BLM riots.\"",
      "Agresti told Fox News Digital there is a \"clear connection\" between crime in the United States and the \"Defund the Police\" movement and that most people don\u2019t grasp the \"full extent\" of the crime problem in this country.",
      "\"We had roughly 17,000 murders last year,\" Agresti explained. \"Imagine if all of them made national news. At the current rate of murders in this county, roughly one in every 230 people in the United States will have their lives cut short by being murdered. That statistic is so unbelievable.\"",
      "In addition to the \"staggering\"\u00a0facts about murder, Agresti said\u00a0data compiled by Just Facts shows one in 10 women in the United States are raped in the course of their lives.",
      "\"Think about the horror of that, and beyond all this pain, suffering, death, there's also a financial cost to crime,\" Agresti said. \"It's been quantified in a 2021 academic paper, and, bottom line, crime in all of its forms, pain, death, suffering, financial loss, activities we take to prevent crime, they amount to a cost on our US economy of roughly $40,000 per U.S. household.\"",
      "Questions have also been raised about local crime stats from D.C. showing crime is down so far this year, with many pointing to news reports that a D.C. police commander was recently suspended for allegedly altering crime data.",
      "Agresti said anyone can \"cherry-pick\" crime statistics to promote a specific agenda but that it is important to also realize that many crimes also go unreported due to various factors, including animosity toward police or the belief that calling the police won\u2019t yield results.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"The vast majority of crime goes unreported, and another phenomenon that's really, really disturbing is the amount of crimes that are solved,\" Agresti said. \"It used to be in this country, in 1960, that 92% of all murders are solved. In 2023, that figure was down to 58%, meaning that 40-plus percent of people who committed murders got away with it, and they're out there to commit them again.\"",

      "Trump's move to crack down on crime in the capital, which the White House says is happening at levels that dwarf capitals in other far more impoverished countries across the world, has sparked protests led by liberal activists and outrage from some elected Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "\"When politicians are saying, 'We don't have to worry about this, it's the lowest crime rate in 30 years,' they are abdicating their responsibility,\" Agresti told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The Declaration of Independence said that governments are instituted to protect the rights of people, including their life, their liberty and the pursuit of happiness. What we have right now is many politicians and governments who are doing an extremely poor job of that, and the pain and suffering is unbelievable. It's just so broad and so horrible.\"",

      "Why cigarette butts make a good asphalt additive",
      "Modern road construction often relies on additives to improve the strength and flexibility of asphalt. Some road-building materials already use cellulose fibers like those found in cigarette filters. That sparked the idea to take used butts, clean them up and put them to work.",

      "1. Collecting and sorting: Filters from traditional and e-cigarettes go through a collection and cleaning process. Ash and residue are removed, leaving behind usable fiber material.",
      "2. Shredding and mixing: Machines shred the cleaned fibers and combine them with synthetic hydrocarbon wax, which serves as a binder.",
      "3. Pellet formation: The blended material is pressed, heated and cut into small pellets that can be easily stored and transported.",
      "4. Asphalt integration: These pellets are added to reclaimed asphalt and bitumen. During heating, the pellets melt and release reinforcing fibers that strengthen the final asphalt mix.",
      "Up to 40% of the final road material can come from these recycled components.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Stronger roads and a cleaner planet thanks to cigarette butt recycling",
      "Recycled cigarette butts make asphalt stronger, more flexible and longer-lasting. The fibers released during mixing act as micro reinforcement, improving fatigue resistance and helping roads withstand heavy traffic and temperature changes. The wax in the pellets lowers the temperature needed to mix asphalt, reducing both energy use and emissions during production. Beyond performance, this method gives cigarette waste a second life. By repurposing billions of discarded filters, cities can reduce litter and pollution while building more sustainable infrastructure.",
      "Illustration of a traditional roadway surface (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What cities are doing next with recycled cigarette butts",
      "This technique is still emerging, but interest is growing worldwide. In Bratislava, Slovakia, city officials have already started collecting cigarette butts specifically for road construction. One road built with this recycled asphalt is already in use, setting an example for other cities to follow.",
      "As more pilot projects roll out and awareness spreads, cigarette butts could shift from toxic litter to a valuable resource in sustainable infrastructure.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Recycling cigarette butts into asphalt solves two problems at once. It clears toxic waste from public spaces and makes roads that last longer.

As more cities explore cleaner, smarter infrastructure, this kind of solution could play a big role in the future of street design.",

      "Researchers at Mozilla's 0Din have discovered a vulnerability in Google's Gemini for Workspace that allows attackers to inject hidden instructions into email summaries. The issue, demonstrated by Marco Figueroa, shows how generative AI tools can be misled through indirect prompt injection. This technique embeds invisible commands inside the body of an email. When Gemini summarizes the message, it interprets and acts on those hidden prompts.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The attack does not rely on suspicious links or attachments. Instead, it uses a combination of HTML and CSS to conceal the prompt by setting the font size to zero and the color to white. These commands remain invisible in Gmail's standard view but are still accessible to Gemini. Once you request a summary, the AI can be tricked into presenting fake security alerts or urgent instructions that appear to come from Google.",

      "So, how can you protect yourself from phishing scams that exploit AI tools like Gemini? Here are six essential steps you can take right now to stay safe:",
      "Just because a summary appears in Gmail or Docs does not mean it is automatically safe. Treat AI-generated suggestions, alerts or links with the same caution you would any unsolicited message. Always verify critical information, such as security alerts or phone numbers, through official sources.",
      "If an email seems unusual, especially if it is unexpected or from someone you do not recognize, avoid using the AI summary feature. Instead, read the full email as it was originally written. This lowers the chance of falling for misleading summaries.",
      "Watch for emails or messages that create a sense of urgency, ask you to verify account details or provide unexpected links or contact information, even if they appear trustworthy or come from familiar sources. Attackers can use AI to craft realistic-looking alerts or requests for sensitive information, sometimes concealed within automatically generated summaries. So, always pause and scrutinize suspicious prompts before responding.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Ensure that Google Workspace and your browser are always running the latest version. Google regularly releases security updates that help prevent newer types of attacks. Also, avoid using unofficial extensions that have access to your Gmail or Docs.",
      "AI-driven scams like the Gemini summary attack don't happen in a vacuum. They often begin with stolen personal information. That data might come from past breaches, public records or details you've unknowingly shared online. A data removal service can help by continuously scanning and requesting the removal of your information from data broker sites. While no service can wipe everything, reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for attackers to personalize phishing attempts or link you to known breach data. Think of it as one more layer of protection in a world where AI makes targeted scams even easier.",

      "For over 150 years, Steves & Sons has delivered high-quality millwork to builders and homeowners. Now, it's making history again, this time by modernizing the supply chain. The pilot will use Bot Auto's driverless trucks to carry freight between manufacturing plants and customers. These are not fantasy test runs. These are real orders, real deliveries and real stakes. J.B. Hunt, which already manages logistics for Steves & Sons, will oversee how autonomous freight fits into their broader transportation system.",

      "Why autonomous trucking in Texas could reshape freight",
      "More than 70% of U.S. freight moves by truck. Rising costs, driver shortages and tight delivery windows all add pressure. Bot Auto claims its technology can do more than keep up; it can outperform. Its Level 4 autonomy doesn't need a driver in the cab. That means longer hauls, fewer delays and potentially lower costs. The big takeaway? Autonomy is moving from hype to hardware.",

They're putting automation to work in a high-volume, real-world setting that could serve as a model nationwide. Autonomous trucking still has hurdles to clear, including regulation, safety and public trust. But this Texas pilot could be one of the first true benchmarks of commercial viability.",

Once inside, the AirTag becomes invisible and unnoticeable to the child wearing the shoes. From there, all tracking happens through Apple's Find My app, which works on any iPhone.

Each pair includes a Skechers Air-Cooled Goga Mat insole with high-rebound cushioning, giving growing feet the support they need throughout the day. Plus, they're machine washable, which saves parents time and effort. The standout feature is the hidden AirTag-compatible compartment tucked beneath the heel of the insole. It comes with a screw-tight cover that keeps the tracker secure and discreet. There's no external AirTag branding, so the shoes look like any regular pair of Skechers. With a breathable mesh and synthetic upper, durable rubber outsole, and 1 1/4-inch heel height, the design delivers both style and function. They're available in sizes for boys and girls, and even without an AirTag, they work perfectly as everyday sneakers.",

It's less intrusive than giving them a phone and more flexible than a built-in GPS system. You control the tracker, you install the battery, and you decide who gets access.

Also, use a strong antivirus software and keep it updated.\u00a0 The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "A new remittance tax set to begin in the new year has one university student reeling from the implications it will have for her family in Nigeria.",
      "Edidiong Chrys, a second-generation Nigerian American, said she thinks the 1% tax passed as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d would directly affect the financial lifeline she sends overseas. This tax will be applied to anyone in the U.S. who sends money abroad.",
      "\u201cWe regularly send money home to support loved ones, including our elders, children in school, newborns and others in need,\u201d she said.",
      "Chrys, 38, said some of the funds sent home have gone to new parents in her family, helping ease the cost of food and traveling to doctors\u2019 appointments. The funds also help her uncle, who has a job but also must pay for his five daughters, who are all in school. He and his wife work, but it\u2019s still not enough \u201cto accommodate all the things that need to hold the household down,\u201d Chrys said.",
      "And then there\u2019s Chrys\u2019 80-year-old grandmother, who was weathering back pain when Chrys visited in January.",
      "\u201cWe are paying for the live-in nurse to help her during the week,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s an additional expense that we need to have for her so that she\u2019s not bending over.\u201d",
      "The tax applies to anyone in the U.S. who sends remittances to their home countries. In 2023, remittances from the U.S. totaled $98 billion, according to the World Bank. Chrys contributes to the $56 billion in remittances sub-Saharan Africa received from people around the world last year. In fact, she said she regularly remits cash \u2014 more than 50 times a year \u2014 to family and friends.",
      "The Center for Global Development, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on reducing global poverty through economic research, published an analysis last month that listed the tax as yet another financial setback for many nations, given the recent reduction in American aid.",
      "Liberia is highly dependent on foreign aid as well as remittances. In 2023, the U.S. accounted for a quarter of the country\u2019s foreign aid, and remittances surpassed Liberia\u2019s bilateral foreign aid by three times, according to the report.",
      "The African Union\u2019s outgoing ambassador to the United States, Hilda Suka-Mafudze, said hindering such funding \u201cthreatens to reverse gains in financial inclusion and development across the continent of Africa.\u201d",
      "Witney Schneidman, a nonresident senior fellow with the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Global Economy and Development program, said, \u201cTo put this tax on is just a further constraint on the U.S. effort to work with our partners on the continent.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not transformational. ... It\u2019s just another obstacle to partnership, and it\u2019s another obstacle to development,\u201d he said.",
      "Schneidman, who also served as deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs in the Clinton administration, condemned the Trump administration for building barriers and not bridges.",
      "\u201cWhen you add it up with the visa blockages, with the end of the [African Growth and Opportunity Act] AGOA, with the end of USAID, it\u2019s just building a wall,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. is building a wall between itself and the world and certainly between itself and Africa.\u201d",
      "Suka-Mafudze, whose focus will turn toward the Southern African Development Community region, said that beyond hurting diplomatic ties, blocking remittances is also \u201ca human issue, because diaspora remittances are lifelines for millions of African families and these remittances often cover essentials, which are food, school fees, medical care and a lot of things. And to impose a tax on that is deeply unjust.\u201d",
      "Chrys said the financial burden of sending money home is already heavy, with some stretching limited resources to make ends meet.",
      "\u201cSome people are not making as much to be able to try to support their family back home,\u201d Chrys said. \u201cWhen I do get a chance to send money home, sometimes I\u2019m spending it from my refund check.\u201d",
      "Democratic Reps. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida and Jonathan L. Jackson of Illinois introduced new legislation called the African Diaspora Investment and Development Act, or AIDA, aimed at reversing the tax\u2019s impact. It would also create more transparency in money transfers, among other things.",

      "Cherfilus-McCormick, the only Haitian American member of Congress right now, warns that a remittance tax would unfairly burden families already struggling to support their loved ones overseas.",
      "\u201cI strongly oppose any effort to tax remittances and will continue fighting for policies that protect immigrant and diaspora communities,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cH.R.4586 \u2014 AIDA intends to reverse course and instead focus on incentivizing and leveraging on the nearly 100 billion of dollars that Haitian, African and Caribbean Americans send home each year to build sustainable partnerships and strengthen economic development.\u201d",
      "Schneidman said the tax has the potential to impact education, health care and families because the bulk of the remittances are family-to-family.",
      "That reality is felt most by those sending the money, who see firsthand how even small amounts can make a big difference.",
      "\u201cIn the U.S., it might feel like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s nothing.\u2019\u201d Chrys said. But in Nigeria, \u201cIt\u2019s everything because every little money counts.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LAS VEGAS \u2014 If at one time it was thought mosquitoes couldn\u2019t survive in desert climates, this city is a case study in how wrong that is.",
      "Mosquitoes typically prefer more tropical, humid conditions, but these biting machines have exploded in number throughout the Las Vegas Valley in recent years because of a host of changes.",
      "A mix of urban development, climate change, insecticide resistance and genetic adaptations are creating a more hospitable environment for the insects in southern Nevada.",
      "Las Vegas is hardly alone in its battle against the pesky insects. Warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns are expanding the geographic range in which mosquitoes live and breed. In many ways, what\u2019s happening here is playing out across the desert Southwest, and beyond.",
      "The mosquitoes have brought with them not only the nuisance of bug bites, but also the major threat of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and West Nile virus to Las Vegas and the rest of Clark County.",
      "It's also caught people off guard.",
      "\u201cPeople aren\u2019t wrong that mosquitoes shouldn\u2019t really thrive in desert conditions, but it\u2019s clear that the particular set of species that we do have in Clark County has adapted to the local ecology,\u201d said Louisa Messenger, an assistant professor in the department of environmental and global health at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.",
      "'A ticking time bomb'",
      "The species that have taken hold in Clark County include Culex mosquitoes, which can carry West Nile virus, and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary spreaders of dengue. What\u2019s more, Messenger and her colleagues at UNLV have found that mosquitoes in Las Vegas are becoming resistant to insecticides, a major public health risk in a city built on tourism.",
      "\u201cIt is a little bit of a ticking time bomb,\u201d Messenger said.",
      "She has for some time been concerned about how vulnerable Las Vegas is to mosquito-borne diseases. In particular, dengue has been surging in North America and South America, with more than 13 million cases recorded across the continents in 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\u201cIn Vegas, we have more than 48 million visitors coming through our doors every year from all over the planet,\u201d Messenger said. \u201cIt just takes a couple of mosquito bites to start local transmission.\u201d",
      "Last year, there were 26 reported cases of West Nile virus in humans in Las Vegas, according to the Southern Nevada Health District, trailing the city\u2019s largest outbreak of 43 cases in 2019. Yet, in 2024, scientists still found a record number of mosquitoes that tested positive for the virus in and around the city, which suggests the risk of exposure was very concerning.",
      "This year, the public health department hasn\u2019t identified any human cases so far, even as mosquitoes have tested positive for the virus in certain ZIP codes. Messenger said it\u2019s not well understood what specific factors fuel outbreaks in some years and not in others.",
      "\u201cWe see these overlapping factors but they are quite difficult to tease it apart,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we can say for certain is that we have these bumper years and these zero years, and they are hard to predict.\u201d",
      "The Southern Nevada Health District has been conducting mosquito surveillance in the region since 2004. Its meticulous records show which mosquito species are present across the Las Vegas Valley year after year and where these flying insects have tested positive for diseases.",
      "One of the most astonishing trends in the data was the explosive growth of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which were first identified in Las Vegas in 2017, said Vivek Raman, environmental health supervisor for the Southern Nevada Health District.",
      "The 'relentless biters' are spreading",
      "\u201cIn 2017, this mosquito was found in just a few ZIP codes,\u201d said Raman, who oversees the health district\u2019s mosquito surveillance program. \u201cA few years later, it was six ZIP codes. Then 12 ZIP codes, then maybe 20, and now it\u2019s in 48 different ZIP codes across the valley.\u201d",
      "In addition to being able to spread dengue, these insects are a major nuisance.",
      "\u201cAedes aegypti are very aggressive daytime-biting mosquitoes,\u201d Raman said. \u201cThey are just relentless biters.\u201d",
      "Unlike Culex mosquitoes, which prefer breeding near larger sources of water such as untended swimming pools, culverts or  detention basins, Aedes aegypti tend to breed in much shallower standing water.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons they are spreading so quickly is the mosquito can lay its eggs in small containers, like if rain fills a child\u2019s toy or tires or a wheelbarrow,\u201d Raman said. \u201cAll it takes is a couple inches of water.\u201d",
      "Urban development in Las Vegas has also inadvertently spurred the spread of mosquitoes in the city. Golf courses, human-made lakes and other forms of artificial irrigation have all made this outpost in the Nevada desert a welcome home for mosquitoes, according to Messenger.",
      "Climate change is likely also a factor, and it\u2019s an active area of research for Messenger and other scientists. Warmer temperatures are expanding the range of geographies for  mosquitoes around the world. A warmer atmosphere can also hold more moisture, which increases humidity and rain, both mosquito-friendly conditions.",
      "In Las Vegas, how the interplay between local environmental factors and changing climate trends is affecting mosquito populations is less well understood, but the implications are paramount.",
      "\u201cLas Vegas is kind of a case study for what climate change is going to look like in other parts of the world,\u201d Messenger said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing record-breaking temperatures, we\u2019re becoming much more arid, precipitation is becoming much more aberrant and unpredictable. That\u2019s what large parts of the world are going to look like over the next 15 to 25 years.\u201d",
      "What that means for mosquitoes in the city remains to be seen, but the problem so far shows no sign of slowing.",
      "The Southern Nevada Health District conducts public outreach on  how to identify and protect against mosquito breeding sites in and around homes, and how to prevent mosquito bites. But, controlling the number of mosquitoes in the city \u2014 and thus controlling the public health risk \u2014 will require a coordinated effort from the local government, Messenger said. Currently, there isn\u2019t one in Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got private pest companies that people can call for severe infestations, you have some work going on around wetlands, but what we don\u2019t have, which many other jurisdictions have, is a centralized, coordinated abatement,\u201d Messenger said.",
      "That lack of coordination has resulted in mosquito populations building up resistance to insecticides, she added. A centralized effort could assess which chemicals are safe to use \u2014 particularly around humans \u2014 and monitor the performance of insecticides and pesticides to prevent mosquitoes from building up immunity.",
      "In the years ahead, Messenger said, prevention and control will be key to protecting the residents of Las Vegas and its many visitors from around the world.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is that this is entirely preventable,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody in southern Nevada, in Clark County, should be getting bit by mosquitoes and contracting any kind of virus.\u201d"

      "\u201cIt was agreed to by all that the best way to end this conflict is through a full peace deal,\u201d Rubio told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about that. I mean, who would be against the fact that tomorrow we came to you and said, \u2018We have a full peace deal, and it\u2019s done.\u2019 I think that\u2019s the best way to end the war.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow, whether there needs to be a ceasefire on the way there, well, we\u2019ve advocated for that,\u201d Rubio added. \u201cUnfortunately, the Russians, as of now, have not agreed to that.\u201d",
      "Rubio\u2019s comments come days after President Donald Trump returned from Alaska, where he met for several hours with Russian President Vladimir Putin and a delegation of Russian leaders.",
      "The fact that neither Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy nor any representative from Ukraine were present for the discussions did not dim hopes among U.S. officials that they could push Putin toward a ceasefire agreement or a peace deal.",
      "After the Alaska meeting, however, the U.S. president told reporters, \u201cThere\u2019s no deal until there\u2019s a deal.\u201d",
      "Later in the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview, Rubio placed blame on Putin for not moving toward a ceasefire, responding to questions about Russia\u2019s continued strikes in Ukraine over the last few days.",
      "\u201cWe think usually it\u2019s very hard to negotiate when you\u2019re in the middle of hostilities. But that said, the only way to have a ceasefire is for both sides to agree to stop firing at one another ... and the Russians just haven\u2019t agreed to that,\u201d he said.",
      "Zelenskyy is headed to the White House on Monday to meet with Trump and other European leaders, including Finland\u2019s President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "In Brussels on Sunday, during a joint press conference with von der Leyen, Zelenskyy emphasized the importance of a ceasefire for peace deal negotiations to continue.",
      "\u201cPutin has many demands, but we do not know all of them, and if there are really as many as we have heard about, then it will take a lot of time to go through all of them, and it is impossible to do this under the pressure of weapons,\" Zelenskyy told reporters. \"So, it is necessary to stop the fire and work quickly on a final agreement. We will talk about this in Washington. Putin does not want to stop the killings, but he must do it.\u201d",
      "Rubio on Sunday spoke more about the Trump administration\u2019s decision not to impose new sanctions on Russia, despite Putin\u2019s reluctance to move toward a peace deal, saying, \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do right now is end the war.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re not going to be able to reach an agreement here at any point, then there are going to be consequences, not only the consequences of the war continuing, but the consequences of all those sanctions continuing, and potentially new sanctions on top of it as well. But what we\u2019re trying to do right now is end the war,\u201d Rubio told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think new sanctions on Russia are going to force them to accept ceasefire. They\u2019re already under very severe sanctions,\u201d he added later in the interview.",
      "The secretary of state also said that the decision to impose new sanctions is incompatible with the fight for a lasting peace deal.",
      "\u201cThose options [for sanctions] remain to the president,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThe minute he takes those steps, all talks stop. The minute we take those steps, there is no one left in the world to go talk to the Russians and try to get them to the table to reach a peace agreement. So that moment may come. I hope not, because I hope we get a peace deal.\u201d",
      "Though Rubio declined to provide insight into negotiations among Ukraine, Russia, the U.S. and European allies, two points that have arisen publicly in recent weeks appear to be about territorial swaps and security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThere has to be talk about what the territories are going to look like and what the border lines are going to look like at the end of this conflict. There has to be talk about Ukraine\u2019s legitimate desire for security in the long term to make sure they don\u2019t get invaded again,\u201d Rubio said Sunday. \u201cThere has to be talk about how Ukraine is rebuilt, and how do you rebuild a country that\u2019s been attacked as often as it has over the last three and a half years.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese are all key elements of any agreement. We understand that. And ... if there\u2019s going to be a deal, each side is going to have to give up on something,\u201d he added.",
      "Looking at a map of the territory in Ukraine that Russia has occupied, Rubio added, \u201cUltimately, if the Ukrainians are not willing to give that up, and no one\u2019s pushing Ukraine to give that up \u2014 and so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what \u2014 there\u2019s going to be a peace deal. It\u2019s not going to look like that.\u201d",
      "The secretary of state added that Putin is \u201ccertainly asking for things that the Ukrainians and others are not willing to be supportive of and that we\u2019re not going to push them to give, and the Ukrainians are asking for things that the Russians are not going to give up on.\u201d",
      "Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, further detailed the discussions about territorial lines on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d saying that there are five crucial regions under discussion in peace deal negotiations.",
      "\u201cThere are five regions here that it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s always in, in our view, been the crux of the deal,\u201d Witkoff told CNN without specifying what the five regions are beyond Donetsk.",
      "\u201cThe Russians made some concessions at the table with regard to all five of those regions,\u201d Witkoff added, saying that the discussion will continue \u201con Monday, when President Zelenskyy arrives with his delegation and some of the other European leaders.\u201d",
      "Rubio also wouldn\u2019t comment on what the United States\u2019 role could look like in potential security guarantees, though Trump has maintained that a potential peace deal would not include a pathway for Ukraine to join NATO.",
      "NBC News previously reported that Trump spoke with Zelenskyy and European leaders over the phone early Saturday morning about a potential NATO-like security guarantee for Ukraine that includes the U.S. as part of a deal struck with Russia.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019ll have to be some security guarantees for Ukraine, right?\u201d Rubio said Sunday. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s one of their fundamental demands \u2014 is that if this war were to end, they have to make sure this never happens again.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn order for there [to] be a peace, the Russian side is going to have to accept that Ukraine is a sovereign country that has a right to defend itself and has a right to enter into alliances with other countries to defend itself. How that\u2019s constructed, what we call it, how it\u2019s built, what guarantees are built in there that are enforceable, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be talking about over the next few days,\u201d the secretary of state added.",
      "On \"Fox News Sunday,\" Witkoff said that security guarantees could potentially be modeled off of NATO's Article Five.",
      "\"It means that the United States is potentially prepared to be able to give Article Five security guarantees, but not from NATO, directly from the United States and other European countries,\" Witkoff said, adding that this was another point of discussion for Monday's meetings with Zelenskyy and other European leaders.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., on Sunday slammed Rubio\u2019s comments and Trump\u2019s decision to meet with Putin in the first place, also appearing on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat meeting was a disaster. It was an embarrassment for the United States. It was a failure. Putin got everything he wanted,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "\u201cTrump said, \u2018If I don\u2019t get a ceasefire, Putin is going to pay a price.\u2019 And then he walked out of that meeting saying, \u2018I didn\u2019t get a ceasefire. I didn\u2019t get a peace deal, and I\u2019m not even considering sanctions,\u2019\u201d Murphy added. \u201cYou heard Secretary Rubio downplay sanctions. And so Putin walks away with his photo op with zero commitments made and zero consequences. What a great day for Russia.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LAS VEGAS \u2014 If at one time it was thought mosquitoes couldn\u2019t survive in desert climates, this city is a case study in how wrong that is.",
      "Mosquitoes typically prefer more tropical, humid conditions, but these biting machines have exploded in number throughout the Las Vegas Valley in recent years because of a host of changes.",
      "A mix of urban development, climate change, insecticide resistance and genetic adaptations are creating a more hospitable environment for the insects in southern Nevada.",
      "Las Vegas is hardly alone in its battle against the pesky insects. Warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns are expanding the geographic range in which mosquitoes live and breed. In many ways, what\u2019s happening here is playing out across the desert Southwest, and beyond.",
      "The mosquitoes have brought with them not only the nuisance of bug bites, but also the major threat of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and West Nile virus to Las Vegas and the rest of Clark County.",
      "It's also caught people off guard.",
      "\u201cPeople aren\u2019t wrong that mosquitoes shouldn\u2019t really thrive in desert conditions, but it\u2019s clear that the particular set of species that we do have in Clark County has adapted to the local ecology,\u201d said Louisa Messenger, an assistant professor in the department of environmental and global health at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.",
      "'A ticking time bomb'",
      "The species that have taken hold in Clark County include Culex mosquitoes, which can carry West Nile virus, and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary spreaders of dengue. What\u2019s more, Messenger and her colleagues at UNLV have found that mosquitoes in Las Vegas are becoming resistant to insecticides, a major public health risk in a city built on tourism.",
      "\u201cIt is a little bit of a ticking time bomb,\u201d Messenger said.",
      "She has for some time been concerned about how vulnerable Las Vegas is to mosquito-borne diseases. In particular, dengue has been surging in North America and South America, with more than 13 million cases recorded across the continents in 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\u201cIn Vegas, we have more than 48 million visitors coming through our doors every year from all over the planet,\u201d Messenger said. \u201cIt just takes a couple of mosquito bites to start local transmission.\u201d",
      "Last year, there were 26 reported cases of West Nile virus in humans in Las Vegas, according to the Southern Nevada Health District, trailing the city\u2019s largest outbreak of 43 cases in 2019. Yet, in 2024, scientists still found a record number of mosquitoes that tested positive for the virus in and around the city, which suggests the risk of exposure was very concerning.",
      "This year, the public health department hasn\u2019t identified any human cases so far, even as mosquitoes have tested positive for the virus in certain ZIP codes. Messenger said it\u2019s not well understood what specific factors fuel outbreaks in some years and not in others.",
      "\u201cWe see these overlapping factors but they are quite difficult to tease it apart,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we can say for certain is that we have these bumper years and these zero years, and they are hard to predict.\u201d",
      "The Southern Nevada Health District has been conducting mosquito surveillance in the region since 2004. Its meticulous records show which mosquito species are present across the Las Vegas Valley year after year and where these flying insects have tested positive for diseases.",
      "One of the most astonishing trends in the data was the explosive growth of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which were first identified in Las Vegas in 2017, said Vivek Raman, environmental health supervisor for the Southern Nevada Health District.",
      "The 'relentless biters' are spreading",
      "\u201cIn 2017, this mosquito was found in just a few ZIP codes,\u201d said Raman, who oversees the health district\u2019s mosquito surveillance program. \u201cA few years later, it was six ZIP codes. Then 12 ZIP codes, then maybe 20, and now it\u2019s in 48 different ZIP codes across the valley.\u201d",
      "In addition to being able to spread dengue, these insects are a major nuisance.",
      "\u201cAedes aegypti are very aggressive daytime-biting mosquitoes,\u201d Raman said. \u201cThey are just relentless biters.\u201d",
      "Unlike Culex mosquitoes, which prefer breeding near larger sources of water such as untended swimming pools, culverts or  detention basins, Aedes aegypti tend to breed in much shallower standing water.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons they are spreading so quickly is the mosquito can lay its eggs in small containers, like if rain fills a child\u2019s toy or tires or a wheelbarrow,\u201d Raman said. \u201cAll it takes is a couple inches of water.\u201d",
      "Urban development in Las Vegas has also inadvertently spurred the spread of mosquitoes in the city. Golf courses, human-made lakes and other forms of artificial irrigation have all made this outpost in the Nevada desert a welcome home for mosquitoes, according to Messenger.",
      "Climate change is likely also a factor, and it\u2019s an active area of research for Messenger and other scientists. Warmer temperatures are expanding the range of geographies for  mosquitoes around the world. A warmer atmosphere can also hold more moisture, which increases humidity and rain, both mosquito-friendly conditions.",
      "In Las Vegas, how the interplay between local environmental factors and changing climate trends is affecting mosquito populations is less well understood, but the implications are paramount.",
      "\u201cLas Vegas is kind of a case study for what climate change is going to look like in other parts of the world,\u201d Messenger said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing record-breaking temperatures, we\u2019re becoming much more arid, precipitation is becoming much more aberrant and unpredictable. That\u2019s what large parts of the world are going to look like over the next 15 to 25 years.\u201d",
      "What that means for mosquitoes in the city remains to be seen, but the problem so far shows no sign of slowing.",
      "The Southern Nevada Health District conducts public outreach on  how to identify and protect against mosquito breeding sites in and around homes, and how to prevent mosquito bites. But, controlling the number of mosquitoes in the city \u2014 and thus controlling the public health risk \u2014 will require a coordinated effort from the local government, Messenger said. Currently, there isn\u2019t one in Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got private pest companies that people can call for severe infestations, you have some work going on around wetlands, but what we don\u2019t have, which many other jurisdictions have, is a centralized, coordinated abatement,\u201d Messenger said.",
      "That lack of coordination has resulted in mosquito populations building up resistance to insecticides, she added. A centralized effort could assess which chemicals are safe to use \u2014 particularly around humans \u2014 and monitor the performance of insecticides and pesticides to prevent mosquitoes from building up immunity.",
      "In the years ahead, Messenger said, prevention and control will be key to protecting the residents of Las Vegas and its many visitors from around the world.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is that this is entirely preventable,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody in southern Nevada, in Clark County, should be getting bit by mosquitoes and contracting any kind of virus.\u201d"

      "Liberia is highly dependent on foreign aid as well as remittances. In 2023, the U.S. accounted for a quarter of the country\u2019s foreign aid, and remittances surpassed Liberia\u2019s bilateral foreign aid by three times, according to the report.",
      "The African Union\u2019s outgoing ambassador to the United States, Hilda Suka-Mafudze, said hindering such funding \u201cthreatens to reverse gains in financial inclusion and development across the continent of Africa.\u201d",
      "Witney Schneidman, a nonresident senior fellow with the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Global Economy and Development program, said, \u201cTo put this tax on is just a further constraint on the U.S. effort to work with our partners on the continent.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not transformational. ... It\u2019s just another obstacle to partnership, and it\u2019s another obstacle to development,\u201d he said.",
      "Schneidman, who also served as deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs in the Clinton administration, condemned the Trump administration for building barriers and not bridges.",
      "\u201cWhen you add it up with the visa blockages, with the end of the [African Growth and Opportunity Act] AGOA, with the end of USAID, it\u2019s just building a wall,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. is building a wall between itself and the world and certainly between itself and Africa.\u201d",
      "Suka-Mafudze, whose focus will turn toward the Southern African Development Community region, said that beyond hurting diplomatic ties, blocking remittances is also \u201ca human issue, because diaspora remittances are lifelines for millions of African families and these remittances often cover essentials, which are food, school fees, medical care and a lot of things. And to impose a tax on that is deeply unjust.\u201d",
      "Chrys said the financial burden of sending money home is already heavy, with some stretching limited resources to make ends meet.",
      "\u201cSome people are not making as much to be able to try to support their family back home,\u201d Chrys said. \u201cWhen I do get a chance to send money home, sometimes I\u2019m spending it from my refund check.\u201d",
      "Democratic Reps. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida and Jonathan L. Jackson of Illinois introduced new legislation called the African Diaspora Investment and Development Act, or AIDA, aimed at reversing the tax\u2019s impact. It would also create more transparency in money transfers, among other things.",
      "Suka-Mafudze backs the legislation, warning the new tax \u201ccould push people toward informal or unregulated channels, making transactions riskier and less transparent.\u201d",
      "Cherfilus-McCormick, the only Haitian American member of Congress right now, warns that a remittance tax would unfairly burden families already struggling to support their loved ones overseas.",
      "\u201cI strongly oppose any effort to tax remittances and will continue fighting for policies that protect immigrant and diaspora communities,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cH.R.4586 \u2014 AIDA intends to reverse course and instead focus on incentivizing and leveraging on the nearly 100 billion of dollars that Haitian, African and Caribbean Americans send home each year to build sustainable partnerships and strengthen economic development.\u201d",
      "Schneidman said the tax has the potential to impact education, health care and families because the bulk of the remittances are family-to-family.",
      "That reality is felt most by those sending the money, who see firsthand how even small amounts can make a big difference.",
      "\u201cIn the U.S., it might feel like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s nothing.\u2019\u201d Chrys said. But in Nigeria, \u201cIt\u2019s everything because every little money counts.\u201d"

      "HONG KONG \u2014 As U.S. television series produce longer and fewer episodes, a new genre from China is gaining American fans by going in the opposite direction.",
      "Known as minidramas, micro dramas or vertical dramas, they are soap operas condensed into a minute or two per episode.",
      "Each show, reminiscent of a telenovela, is split into dozens of chapters, each about two minutes long and with all the soapy elements: cheesy romance, over-the-top drama and abundant cliff-hangers.",
      "\u201cThe revenge ones, oh, my God, they\u2019re so good,\u201d California-based retail business owner Jacarius Murphy told NBC News in a video interview.",
      "Murphy is a fan of the minidramas, known as duanju in Chinese, which focus heavily on romance, revenge and fantasy. The stories tend to involve wealthy characters such as a chief executive who\u2019s secretly a vampire or a billionaire living a double life \u2014 characters often played by American actors.",
      "\u201cPeople want this fast dopamine hit, and they can snack on it while they\u2019re waiting,\u201d said Anina Net, an American actress based in Los Angeles who has worked on minidramas for the past four years.",
      "The genre originated in China, where production companies have tapped into the popularity of short-form, vertical-produced, TikTok-style video content. About half of China\u2019s 1.4 billion people consume dramas in this style, according to a report released in March by the state-owned China Netcasting Services Association.",
      "The industry made $6.9 billion in revenue last year, more than China\u2019s total box office sales.",
      "The shows are \u201cstill quite limited in genre, mostly romance-focused, with sweet, domineering CEO tropes and modern settings,\u201d said Kaidi Dai, a Shanghai-based minidrama producer.",
      "Now, having figured out the Chinese market, the same companies are expanding into the U.S., where minidramas are finding success just a few years after the failure of Quibi, a short-lived, short-form mobile streaming service. The shows are available on platforms such as ReelShort, DramaBox and GoodShort, which offers free episodes and in-app purchases as well as subscriptions.",
      "Minidramas cost far less to make than standard TV shows and can make millions of dollars in revenue through a combination of user purchases and advertising. But adapting them to the U.S. market takes some tweaking, said Chinese filmmaker Gao Feng, also known as Frank Tian, who has a minidrama production company based in New York.",
      "Rather than remaking Chinese shows, his company hired longtime U.S. residents to craft stories that would appeal to American audiences.",
      "\u201cI believe that scripts determine 65-70% of a project\u2019s success,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cApart from werewolves, CEO romances and hidden identities, we should explore new genres.\u201d",
      "While many short dramas have been based on successful Chinese stories, \u201cif a platform cannot innovate continuously, it will face significant challenges,\u201d he added.",
      "Among the most popular shows is \u201cThe Double Life of My Billionaire Husband,\u201d which tells the story of a woman whose husband is better off financially than he appears. All 60 episodes can be viewed in less than 70 minutes on ReelShort, the California-based, Chinese-backed minidrama platform that released it in 2023.",

      "\u201cThe short videos on TikTok have laid a solid foundation for the popularity of short dramas,\u201d Yan Min, who helped organize an industry conference in China last year, said in an interview.",
      "Min said ReelShort and other companies were advertising on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok to attract new users, catering to the \u201cevolving viewing habits of younger generations, who have grown up with platforms like TikTok and are accustomed to short, engaging content.\u201d",
      "U.S. entertainment companies have taken notice of the trend. Netflix said in May that it was testing a vertical feed made up of clips from its shows and movies, while Disney said last month that it was investing in DramaBox through its accelerator program.",
      "Though minidramas seeking U.S. audiences are increasingly using actors with American backgrounds, they often shoot in scenic Chinese locations like the coastal city of Qingdao, with its Western-style villas and architecture, for greater authenticity.",
      "\u201cWe seek actors and screenwriters who grew up in the U.S. and naturally embody an American style. Then we incorporate some Chinese elements,\u201d said Ann An, a Beijing-based freelance producer for several minidramas made for foreign audiences.",
      "Turnarounds are incredibly fast in the industry as producers strive to keep costs low. An said a show can finish filming in 10 days, with a budget of under $70,000.",
      "The biggest key to the success of minidramas, though, is the cliff-hangers, which push viewers to keep paying for the next episode.",
      "\u201cThe scriptwriters know exactly where to place these cliff-hangers, and they execute them very well,\u201d said Apple Yang, a minidrama director based in London.",
      "That helps explain the appeal of minidramas even if their overall quality is sometimes \u201cunderwhelming,\u201d said Ying Zhu, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film.",

    "summary": "Hackers and cybersecurity companies have entered an AI arms race.",
    "story": [
      "This summer, Russia\u2019s hackers put a new twist on the barrage of phishing emails sent to Ukrainians.",
      "The hackers included an attachment containing an artificial intelligence program. If installed, it would automatically search the victims\u2019 computers for sensitive files to send back to Moscow.",
      "That campaign, detailed in July in technical reports from the Ukrainian government and several cybersecurity companies, is the first known instance of Russian intelligence being caught building malicious code with large language models (LLMs), the type of AI chatbots that have become ubiquitous in corporate culture.",
      "Those Russian spies are not alone. In recent months, hackers of seemingly every stripe \u2014 cybercriminals, spies, researchers and corporate defenders alike \u2014 have started including AI tools into their work.",
      "LLMs, like ChatGPT, are still error-prone. But they have become remarkably adept at processing language instructions and at translating plain language into computer code, or identifying and summarizing documents.",
      "The technology has so far not revolutionized hacking by turning complete novices into experts, nor has it allowed would-be cyberterrorists to shut down the electric grid. But it\u2019s making skilled hackers better and faster. Cybersecurity firms and researchers are using AI now, too \u2014 feeding into an escalating cat-and-mouse game between offensive hackers who find and exploit software flaws and the defenders who try to fix them first.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of the beginning. Maybe moving towards the middle of the beginning,\u201d said Heather Adkins, Google\u2019s vice president of security engineering.",
      "In 2024, Adkins\u2019 team started on a project to use Google\u2019s LLM, Gemini, to hunt for important software vulnerabilities, or bugs, before criminal hackers could find them. Earlier this month, Adkins announced that her team had so far discovered at least 20 important overlooked bugs in commonly used software and alerted companies so they can fix them. That process is ongoing.",
      "None of the vulnerabilities have been shocking or something only a machine could have discovered, she said. But the process is simply faster with an AI. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anybody find something novel,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of doing what we already know how to do. But that will advance.\u201d",
      "Adam Meyers, a senior vice president at the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, said that not only is his company using AI to help people who think they\u2019ve been hacked, he sees increasing evidence of its use from the Chinese, Russian, Iranian and criminal hackers that his company tracks.",
      "\u201cThe more advanced adversaries are using it to their advantage,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more of it every single day,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "The shift is only starting to catch up with hype that has permeated the cybersecurity and AI industries for years, especially since ChatGPT was introduced to the public in 2022. Those tools haven\u2019t always proved effective, and some cybersecurity researchers have complained about would-be hackers falling for fake vulnerability findings generated with AI.",
      "Scammers and social engineers \u2014 the people in hacking operations who pretend to be someone else, or who write convincing phishing emails \u2014 have been using LLMs to seem more convincing since at least 2024.",
      "But using AI to directly hack targets is only just starting to actually take off, said Will Pearce, the CEO of DreadNode, one of a handful of new security companies that specialize in hacking using LLMs.",
      "The reason, he said, is simple: The technology has finally started to catch up to expectations.",
      "\u201cThe technology and the models are all really good at this point,\u201d he said.",
      "Less than two years ago, automated AI hacking tools would need significant tinkering to do their job properly, but they are now far more adept, Pearce told NBC News.",
      "Another startup built to hack using AI, Xbow, made history in June by becoming the first AI to climb to the top of the HackerOne U.S. leaderboard, a live scoreboard of hackers around the world that since 2016 has kept tabs on the hackers identifying the most important vulnerabilities and giving them bragging rights. Last week, HackerOne added a new category for groups automating AI hacking tools to distinguish them from individual human researchers. Xbow still leads that.",
      "Hackers and cybersecurity professionals have not settled whether AI will ultimately help attackers or defenders more. But at the moment, defense appears to be winning.",
      "Alexei Bulazel, the senior cyber director at the White House National Security Council, said at a panel at the Def Con hacker conference in Las Vegas last week that the trend will hold, at least as long as the U.S. holds most of the world\u2019s most advanced tech companies.",
      "\u201cI very strongly believe that AI will be more advantageous for defenders than offense,\u201d Bulazel said.",
      "He noted that hackers finding extremely disruptive flaws in a major U.S. tech company is rare, and that criminals often break into computers by finding small, overlooked flaws in smaller companies that don\u2019t have elite cybersecurity teams. AI is particularly helpful in discovering those bugs before criminals do, he said.",
      "\u201cThe types of things that AI is better at \u2014 identifying vulnerabilities in a low cost, easy way \u2014 really democratizes access to vulnerability information,\u201d Bulazel said.",
      "That trend may not hold as the technology evolves, however. One reason is that there is so far no free-to-use automatic hacking tool, or penetration tester, that incorporates AI. Such tools are already widely available online, nominally as programs that test for flaws in practices used by criminal hackers.",
      "If one incorporates an advanced LLM and it becomes freely available, it likely will mean open season on smaller companies\u2019 programs, Google\u2019s Adkins said.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s also reasonable to assume that at some point someone will release [such a tool],\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the point at which I think it becomes a little dangerous.\u201d",
      "Meyers, of CrowdStrike, said that the rise of agentic AI \u2014 tools that conduct more complex tasks, like both writing and sending emails or executing code that programs \u2014 could prove a major cybersecurity risk.",
      "\u201cAgentic AI is really AI that can take action on your behalf, right? That will become the next insider threat, because, as organizations have these agentic AI deployed, they don\u2019t have built-in guardrails to stop somebody from abusing it,\u201d he said."

Style: We made sure to include shoe storage options that are made of different materials like wood and metal, and ones that are mostly made up of shelving without any type of door. We also included options that have a cabinet style to them, meaning they often have doors to keep shoes out of sight while also doubling as decor or furniture.",

The bookcase has adjustable shelves so you can move them around according to the height of your shoes \u2014 boots, for example, will need more space than a pair of sandals. But each shelf is only about 11 inches deep (about a size 11 in men\u2019s shoes or a women\u2019s 12), so make sure that works for your shoe collection. There are six shelves, and assuming you can place around three pairs of shoes per shelf, it should fit 18 pairs of shoes.

ClosetMaid specifically singles out any that measure smaller than 5.75 inches tall by 4.5 inches wide by 11 inches deep. The organizer comes in three colors: white, espresso and dark cherry.",
      "How to decide what shoe storage solution to buy",
      "Organize your shoesBefore buying any kind of shoe storage, McGreevy encourages a shoe cleanse: Categorize all of your shoes first and then place them side-by-side and decide whether to hold on to them, donate them or throw them away. \u201cGoing through this step is important so that you don\u2019t end up organizing extra pairs of shoes or buying more storage than you need,\u201d she said. \u201cCount how many pairs \u2014 and how many of each type \u2014 you have after decluttering. Purchase storage based on those numbers.\u201d",
      "Factor in shoe sizeAfter you assess which shoes need to go in the shoe case, look at your space as a whole. The type of shoe organizer you buy should also depend on the size of your space and how often you wear each pair, McGreevy said.",
      "Wear frequencySolomon agreed and added that the frequency at which you wear your favorite pairs is especially important when searching for shoe storage, since you won\u2019t want to tuck away shoes into individual storage bins if you plan on wearing them frequently. Instead, opt for open storage like a shoe cubby or shoe rack that allows for easy access, Solomon suggested. An over-the-door shoe bag could work for someone who doesn\u2019t need their collection in plain sight, she said. Plus, it frees up floor space.",
      "How to properly store shoes",
      "Generally, you should make sure you\u2019re storing shoes somewhere that isn\u2019t directly hit by sunlight but is well-ventilated and cleaned regularly, according to Meck. This can help prevent shoes from becoming damaged or collecting dust.",
      "For shoes that you want to pack away, Meck explained that wrapping them in tissue paper (and even old clothes) can keep them from scraping or scuffing together.",
      "For those shoes you reach for regularly, Solomon recommended leaving them around an entryway to prevent dirt from traveling further into your house or apartment.",
      "Here are a few other expert-recommended tips to consider when arranging your shoe storage:",
      "Boots: Both McGreevy and Solomon suggested using shapers in order to help maintain their shape and keep them standing straight. The two recommended this affordable option from The Container Store. For seasonal shoes like winter and rain boots, Solomon recommends the best place for storage is in an entryway closet or mudroom, especially if you don\u2019t want to drag in dirt from outside.Sneakers: Avoid sealed storage like storage bins for sneakers since these shoes need to breathe to look fresh and new, Solomon said. She\u2019s a fan of stocking sneakers in shoe cubbies, especially for someone who has a larger collection that they want to show off.Heels: Those who have a bigger selection of high heels should look between the shelves of a shoe shelf. Solomon recommended avoiding shoe racks with slats, as they \u201calways lead to heels getting stuck in between the rungs,\u201d or slanted shelves, as shoes tend to fall off the racks more easily.\u201d",

      "ESPN\u2019s new documentary about the Kansas City Chiefs showed Travis Kelce's teammates' initial reactions to his relationship with Taylor Swift.",
      "The third episode of \u201cThe Kingdom,\u201d a the six-part documentary about the Super Bowl-winning NFL team, looked back at Swift\u2019s first appearance at a game in September 2023 during the matchup between the Chiefs and Chicago Bears at Arrowhead Stadium.",
      "Her surprise attendance came after weeks of speculation that the couple were dating. The rumors were further fueled by comments made by Travis' older brother, Jason Kelce, months after Chief's tight end tried to give Swift his number via a friendship bracelet at a stop on her \u201cEras Tour.\u201d",
      "Swift\u2019s attendance at the game sparked a media flurry, as well as excitement within the entire Chiefs organization, including Travis Kelce's teammates.",
      "Chris Jones, defensive tackle for the Chiefs, said, \u201cYou know the locker room was like, \u2018Taylor Swift\u2019s here. Taylor Swift\u2019s here. For real? With Travis? Oh my god.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my god, Travis pulled Taylor Swift,\u2019\u201d Jones added.",
      "Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes had a bit more of a heads up than the rest of the team and the world, sharing during the documentary, \u201cHe told me during the week. I was one of those like, \u2018I got to see it, you know? I got to see it until I believe it.\u2019\u201d",
      "In game footage included in the series, Mahomes was filmed talking to Travis Kelce on the sidelines about Swift in the box, telling the tight end, \u201cThat\u2019s the first person I noticed. I didn\u2019t see anybody else.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou definitely felt the buzz and you could see people in the stadium gravitating toward where she was at there,\u201d Mahomes said during the documentary. \u201cBut at the same time, we had business to handle.\u201d",
      "In a post-game interview, Mahomes addressed questions about his teammate\u2019s relationship status, sharing at the time that he had not met the singer. He added, \u201cIf she ends up being with Travis, then I\u2019ll probably get to meet her at some point.\u201d",
      "Chiefs head coach Andy Reid also gave his two cents on the romance between Travis Kelce and Swift, sharing at a press conference that he had already met Swift before and that he \u201cset them up.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy that time, I knew they were going out. I knew her before him,\u201d he explained. \u201cHer dad was a big Eagles fan. She was doing a concert in Philadelphia, so we did the meet and greet thing. She told Travis, \u2018You know, I know your coach.\u2019 And he went, \u2018Oh no.\u2019\u201d",
      "As for the widespread reaction to Swift\u2019s attendance at the game, Chiefs cornerback Trent McDuffie put it best \u2014 \u201cThe Swifties are a real thing. Everybody can feel it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fan base is just going insane,\u201d Chiefs safety Justin Reid explained. \u201cThe sport has just grown tremendously with her being a part of it. The NFL is loving this, I know it. You couldn\u2019t have painted a better picture than to have this happen.\u201d",
      "The documentary also included a moment with Swift after the Chiefs defeated the Buffalo Bills in the AFC championship game in January 2025. The cameras followed Swift on the field, where she stood with quarterback Patrick Mahomes\u2019 wife, Brittany Mahomes, and Travis Kelce\u2019s mom, Donna Kelce.",
      "In the scene, Swift shared her gratitude for the support of Brittany Mahomes during the postseason, alongside Donna Kelce.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve kept me so calm the last couple weeks,\u201d Swift said. \u201cI did not know what to do and I\u2019d just text Brittany and just be like, \u2018Tell me it\u2019s going to be OK. Tell me it\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Bob Odenkirk reprises his role as Hutch Mansell, an off-the-books government assassin, in \u201cNobody 2.\u201d",
      "The new film, now out in theaters, is a follow up to Odenkirk's 2021 film \u201cNobody,\u201d which introduced the actor as a middle-class working suburban dad with a lethal past.",
      "In the first film, Hutch\u2019s seemingly domestic life unravels after two intruders break into his home. His decision not to fight back strains his marriage and leaves him questioning whom he has become. When a bus fight puts him up against Russian mobster Yulian Kuznetsov, Hutch enlists help from his father, David (Christopher Lloyd), and brother Harry (RZA) to take down Kuznetsov's crew. The film ends with Hutch and his family moving into a new home \u2014 but their return to normal appears to be short-lived when Hutch receives a phone call that suggests his assassin days aren\u2019t quite over yet.",
      "Now, four years later in \u201cNobody 2,\u201d Hutch is still trying to keep his two worlds apart. \u201cIt\u2019s basically about work-life balance but with an assassin as the worker,\u201d Odenkirk tells TODAY.com in an exclusive interview.",
      "Read on to learn more about \u201cNobody 2\u201d and what Odenkirk has to say about the possibility of a \u201cNobody 3\u201d and other sequels.",
      "(Warning: Spoilers from \u201cNobody 2\u201d below\u2026)",
      "What Happens in 'Nobody 2'?",
      "\u201cNobody 2\u201d opens with Hutch going through the motions of being a contract killer for the government while balancing being an involved dad and devoted husband. Though he feels he's found a way to manage both, Odenkirk tells TODAY.com Hutch knows that's far from the truth.",
      "\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s got a balance in his life, but he knows he\u2019s wrong ... (though) he wishes he did,\u201d Odenkirk says. \u201cHe has his actions, his missions that he\u2019s doing, and he enjoys those. And then he\u2019s got his family, which he is kind of ignoring, and he starts to become very aware of the fact that he\u2019s not staying connected with his family because he\u2019s just too preoccupied.\u201d",
      "In an effort to reconnect with his family, Hutch takes his wife, kids and dad on a summer vacation to a run-down theme park in Plummerville, where his dad once took him and his brother to when they were kids. But his promising family plans quickly unravel when Hutch gets into a dust-up with the local sheriff.",
      "\u201cThe vacation is filled, as most vacations can be, with annoyances and problems and shortcomings, and then that all builds up inside him, and he explodes,\u201d Odenkirk tells TODAY.com.",
      "As tensions mount, Hutch\u2019s instincts take over, and the trip turns into something much more dangerous when he discovers that Plummerville is a base for a massive bootlegging operation. What begins as a chance to bond with his family soon becomes another mission.",
      "In the official trailer, Hutch is seen in brutal physical fights, while his wife Becca (Connie Nielsen) urges him to \u201cfix it\u201d \u2014 a clear sign he\u2019s right back in the kind of high-stakes conflict he can\u2019t seem to avoid.",
      "Though the comedy action film leans more towards \"John Wick\" than \"National Lampoon's Vacation,\" Odenkirk says the film offers relatable moments.",
      "\u201cGetting the garbage out on garbage day and not making it to your son\u2019s basketball games because you are working and trying to plan a vacation,\" Odenkirk explains. \"These are all things I think people can relate to.\u201d",
      "How Does 'Nobody 2' End?",
      "\u201cNobody 2\u201d ends with a blow out fight between Hutch and his crew and the local police force and mobsters who work for Lendina (Sharon Stone) \u2014 the ruthless crime boss who runs the bootlegging operation through Plummerville. Hutch becomes Lendina's target after he meddles in her operation by saving the theme park operator's son, whom she had kidnapped, and burning down her massive fortune.",
      "Odenkirk calls the \u201clast third of the film ... a James Bond film, but with a family involved.\u201d It includes explosions, large-scale action sequences and an ending that circles back to Hutch\u2019s core conflict: protecting his family while accepting who he really is.",
      "In the end, Lendina and her crew are eliminated after a fiery and  intense battle that ultimately brings the family together following their harrowing experience.",
      "Does 'Nobody 2' Have a Post-Credits Scene?",
      "\u201cNobody 2\u201d does not have a post-credits scene, but it does have a scene that plays at the beginning of the end-credits.",
      "While most end-credits and post-credits scenes help to wrap up any loose ends from the film or tease the next chapter in a franchise, the final scene in \u201cNobody 2\u201d only offers snapshots of what happened during the family's action-packed vacation in Plummerville. It includes pictures taken by Hutch's daughter that show various moments from their vacation and epic battle at the amusement park.",
      "Will There Be a 'Nobody 3'?",
      "In an exclusive interview with TODAY.com, Odenkirk says he would be down to do another \u201cNobody\u201d sequel, officially reprising his role of Hutch.",
      "\u201cI want a 'Nobody 3' and a 'Nobody 4,'\u201d he says. But, according to Odenkirk, there has yet to be an official conversation to get the ball rolling on it.",
      "\u201cIf the audience likes it \u2026 they decide, not us,\u201d he explains.",
      "On the date of publication, \u201cNobody 2\u201d has already scored a 77% score on Rotten Tomatoes from critics and a 91% audience score.",
      "What Does Bob Odenkirk Say About 'Nobody 3'?",
      "Whether or not a third \u201cNobody\u201d film gets green-lit, Odenkirk already has a specific direction in mind. Just as \u201cNobody 2\u201d is set four years after the first film, he sees the next installment reflecting another time jump, four years after \u201cNobody 2.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow those kids are older, Hutch really needs to reconnect before they split apart,\u201d he says of his on-screen children, Sammy (Paisley Cadorath) and Brady (Gage Munroe). In a potential third film, Odenkirk says his son would now be a 22-year-old adult, which could bring \u201canother level of trying to stay connected and a different set of tensions and challenges.\u201d",
      "Aside from all the action, Odenkirk says the balance of relatable family dynamics is at the heart of the series. \u201cThese films are meant to ... connect with our audience and connect this character on a common shared sense of family tension, and then let them become part of an action movie.\u201d",
      "He also says there could be space for Becca's backstory, which he revealed they filmed for \"Nobody 2.\"",
      "\"We know that backstory. In fact, we wrote it into \u2018Nobody 2,\u2019 but we didn\u2019t shoot it because we didn\u2019t have room in the story,\" Odenkirk tells TODAY.com. \"But we do know who Hutch and Becca are. We do know how they met, and we do know that they both know, if they cast their minds back to how they met, they both know that they are with a kick a-- spouse, and sometimes they forget that.\"",
      "\u201cNobody 2\" is a Universal Pictures film, which shares TODAY.com's parent company, NBCUniversal."

      "(Warning: Spoilers from \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d below\u2026)",
      "Nearly 20 years after their last collaboration, Denzel Washington and Spike Lee are teaming up again for a crime thriller that shows the two-time-Oscar-winning actor going to great lengths to protect his family and his music empire.",
      "Lee\u2019s \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d a modern re-imagining of the 1963 film \u201cHigh and Low\u201d by Japanese auteur Akira Kurosawa (which was a loosely based on Ed McBain's 1959 novel \u201cKing\u2019s Ransom\u201d), introduces audiences to Washington\u2019s character, David King, a music mogul at a New York City music label called Stackin\u2019 Hits Records. David intends to thwart a merger at the company so he can buy the label and have complete control of the company he helped build. But on the day of his planned business deal, David receives a call from a mysterious man who says he has abducted him son, Trey (Aubrey Joseph), and will not return him safely until he receives $17.5 million.",
      "David tells the police he will pay the ransom but changes his mind once he learns that the kidnapper accidentally took the son of his driver, Paul, played by Jeffrey Wright. Despite the mix up, the abductor calls again and says he still wants David to fork over the money or Paul\u2019s son, Kyle (Elijah Wright), will die.",
      "The ruthless unknown figure making demands at the other end of the line is played by rapper A$AP Rocky. During the movie\u2019s final act, Washington and A$AP Rocky\u2019s characters come face-to-face for the first time in two intense scenes, exchanging bars and jabs. There\u2019s an effortlessness to the back-and-forth between them, a groove that is also felt in the way Washington carries himself the entire film.",
      "Washington tells TODAY.com that reuniting with Lee and making \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d their sixth film together and first since 2006\u2019s \u201cInside Man,\u201d felt familiar.",
      "\u201cIt was just like (an) old hat, you know, like putting the glove back on,\u201d he says about their reunion. \u201cBang, here we go. There\u2019s a rhythm to it.\u201d",
      "Below, Washington and Wright break down pivotal scenes in \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d and discuss working with each other and A$AP Rocky. Read on to find out what the two co-stars shared and how the \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d ends.",
      "Jeffrey Wright Unpacks Heart-Wrenching Scene With Denzel Washington",
      "After learning that his son is safe, David is reluctant to pay the ransom, knowing that if he does then he won\u2019t have enough money to buy back ownership of Stackin\u2019 Hits Records. During one of the most emotional moments in the movie, Paul goes to his boss and pleads with him to help bring his son home. Wright opens up about shooting the taxing scene to TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the critical question (at the center of the film): \u2018What would you do?\u2019 But in this case, I am in the middle of it,\u201d says Wright. The Academy Award nominee adds that having his son Elijah portray Kyle \u2014 in his feature film debut \u2014 made the scene feel more real.",
      "\u201cAs a father, with my son Elijah playing the role, that helped kind of intensify the stakes for me,\u201d Wright shares. \u201cIt\u2019s also a little bit of this edge in there, this challenge in there, because you\u2019re coming with your hand out in a place of almost helplessness.\u201d",
      "He continues, \u201cSo, I wanted to make sure that that was done, but he was able to maintain his sense of dignity at the same time, being completely exposed to the hard facts of the danger that his son was in.\u201d",
      "Wright explains that the conversation is portrayed differently in Kurosawa\u2019s film \u2014 which follows a wealthy shoe executive named Kingo (Toshiro Mifune) whose family becomes the target of a ruthless kidnapper \u2014 because it represents the differences in social classes specific to Japanese culture.",
      "He says his character\u2019s \u201cHigh and Low\u201d counterpart (Aoki, played by Yutaka Sada) is \u201ccompletely submissive, almost to the point of he\u2019s completely powerless. I wanted to see if I could kind of right the balance there a little bit.\u201d",
      "But David remains unconvinced he should pay the hefty ransom following Paul\u2019s emotional plea and rejects him. It isn\u2019t until the music titan has a harsh heart-to-heart with his own son that he changes his mind.",
      "David agrees to meet A$AP Rocky\u2019s character, later revealed to be aspiring rapper Yung Felon, while working with authorities to set a trap. He rides the subway to the Yankee Stadium stop in the Bronx and accidentally drops the backpack containing the $17.5 million and a tracking device. Through a series of diversions, Yung Felon evades the police and gets away with the cash. He honors his word and sets Kyle free, leaving the teen bloodied and bruised in a park.",
      "What Happens at the End of \u2018Highest 2 Lowest\u2019?",
      "Although David is seen as a local hero, his fellow music executives realize that he used their money for the ransom and threaten to sue him for breach of contract. He leaves his office and decides to stroll the Brooklyn Bridge and listen to songs from artists who sent demos to the label in hopes of receiving a record deal. David, with the self-described \u201cbest ears in the business,\u201d notices that one of the tracks features an artist with the same voice as the kidnapper.",
      "When the police aren\u2019t quick to investigate his theory, David and Paul follow a tip that leads them to Yung Felon\u2019s apartment and later to a studio where he is recording a song. David, armed, goes into the studio alone and confronts Yung Felon. The young artist calls out David for not recognizing his talents sooner, blaming the exec for his lack of success in life.",
      "Washington praises A$AP Rocky\u2019s performance in their scenes together, telling TODAY.com, \u201cHe came in ready, and so did I, and we just hit the ball back and forth across the net. It was simple. It was easy because he was prepared, and so was I.\u201d",
      "The 70-year-old actor adds, \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful young artist. He\u2019s a wonderful young actor, and the sky\u2019s the limit for him.\u201d",
      "Yung Felon fires a gunshot at David before running away and boarding a train. But David is right behind him, and the two fight before the mogul gains the upper hand. Yung Felon is arrested and publicly claims he is innocent as he arrives at a courthouse surrounded by supporters. Privately, he accepts a plea deal to go to prison for a couple decades. He also has a final request: to speak to David one more time.",
      "The two sit down, separated by a glass partition, for another sparring of words. Yung Felon says his popularity has caused his song to skyrocket on charts around the world. He says multiple labels are interested in him, but he wants David to sign him. David rebuffs his offer, revealing that he no longer works for Stackin\u2019 Hits Records and is starting a smaller, independent label. Yung Felon becomes enraged as he is dragged away by guards.",
      "In the final scene, David meets with a new artist named Sula (Aiyana-Lee), discovered by his son, who wants to be a star. She sings an original song for him, titled \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d before David promises to make her dream come true.",
      "At the end of the film it's revealed the David's new label will be a family managed business."

      "Odenkirk\u2019s character, who was first introduced in the Bryan Cranston-led crime drama \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d received a spinoff series in 2015 that served as an origin story for Saul Goodman. It followed the Albuquerque, New Mexico criminal defense attorney, born Jimmy McGill, and his transformation from aspiring lawyer to the ambitious, and at times morally ambiguous, lawyer with ties to the criminal underworld.",
      "Created and executive produced by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, the same team behind \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d ended with Odenkirk\u2019s character serving an 86-year prison sentence after confessing to his crimes, which included supporting Walter White (Cranston)\u2019s drug operation and acknowledging the role he played in his brother Howard\u2019s death.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re guys who, for different reasons, have pretty big chips on their shoulders, and that\u2019s hard to play after a while,\u201d Odenkirk told the outlet. \u201cYou can\u2019t just carry that guy around all the time.\u201d",
      "But, Odenkirk reveals to TODAY.com, a \"Better Call Saul\" revival is not out of the question. The actor exclusively tells us what it would take for him to reprise his \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d character and jump back into that universe.",

      "Marty Singer, Priscilla Presley's attorney, called the lawsuit \"a sad and vicious attempt to falsely tarnish the reputation of an eighty-year-old woman\" in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\u201cAccusing a grieving mother of contributing to her daughter\u2019s death is not savvy advocacy; it is malicious character assassination, and should be broadly condemned,\u201d Singer said. \u201cThese fabricated claims have absolutely no validity and we are confident this case will be dismissed.\u201d",
      "Riley Keough, the daughter of Lisa Marie Presley and granddaughter of Priscilla Presley, \"stands behind her grandmother 100% and is equally disgusted with this latest, vicious attempt ... to ruin her grandmother's life,\" Singer said.",

      "But once they improved her financial standing, she \u201cabruptly cut ties\u201d with them and denied them brand opportunities related to the movie \u201cPriscilla\u201d and other projects, Kruse and Fialko allege.",
      "Kruse and Fialko also make an explosive allegation regarding the death of Priscilla Presley's daughter in 2023.",
      "Lisa Marie Presley died of a small bowel obstruction on Jan. 12, 2023, in Los Angeles, according to an autopsy report from the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner obtained by NBC News.",
      "According to the complaint, Lisa Marie Presley was \"noticeably ill, complaining to Priscilla about her health\" when they attended the 2023 Golden Globes, just two days before her death.",
      "Instead of caring for her daughter or taking her to a nearby hospital, the lawsuit alleges Priscilla Presley \u201cclasped to the spotlight, going out to the Chateau Marmont for drinks with Lisa, and then sent Lisa on a long drive to her Calabasas home.\u201d",
      "Just over 24 hours later, Lisa Marie Presley was rushed to the hospital after she suffered cardiac arrest, the complaint states.",
      "Priscilla Presley went to the hospital, and \"despite Lisa\u2019s clear directive to \u2018prolong her life\u2019, Priscilla pulled the plug within hours of Lisa being admitted, and before her granddaughter, Riley, was able to get to the hospital,\u201d the complaint alleges.",
      "About a week after her daughter's death, Priscilla Presley allegedly said, \"I'm the queen. I'm in charge of Graceland,\" according to the complaint.",
      "In recent years both parties have filed other lawsuits against each other, including one in which Priscilla Presley accused her former business partners of financial elder abuse.",
      "An attorney for one of the former business partners called that lawsuit \u201cretaliatory\u201d due to another lawsuit they had filed against her the year before. Both lawsuits are still ongoing.",
      "Priscilla Presley was married to Elvis Presley for six years before they divorced in 1973. Elvis Presley died four years later, in 1977."

      "But sometimes, you learn it\u2019s time to fight for yourself. And Netflix\u2019s new movie, \u201cNight Always Comes,\u201d starring Oscar nominees Vanessa Kirby (\"Pieces of a Woman\") and Jennifer Jason Leigh (\"The Hateful Eight\"), asks exactly that question.",
      "In it, Kirby\u2019s desperate character Lynette has to scrounge up a down payment on a house overnight or risk her whole family being unhoused. But there are secrets that only emerge in the last moments that upend everything.",
      "So what happens in \u201cNight Always Comes,\u201d and what about that quiet shocker of an ending?",
      "What Is \u2018Night Aways Comes\u2019 About?",
      "Lynette is a grown woman living with mom Doreen (Leigh) and older, mentally disabled brother Kenny (Zack Gottsagen).",
      "In order to save the house they\u2019ve lived in for decades, they have to come up with a $25,000 down payment \u2014 or end up on the streets. But Doreen uses that money to buy a new car, which risks not only the loss of the house but also Kenny taken away to live in special care. Lynette now has to find that enormous sum by the next morning.",
      "Her assets? Her own beat-up old car, a sketchy history with a lot of less-than-honorable folks, and a long night ahead.",
      "What Does Lynette Do to Get the Money?",
      "Lynette pulls on as many strings as she can to avoid being unhoused, but each goes wrong in spectacularly different ways. Along the way we learn about Lynette\u2019s difficult history, from living with a man who pimped her out when she was 16, to seeing how she loses it when things become difficult.",
      "During the night, she runs someone down, steals a car and a safe, and faces down every possible low-life you can imagine. There\u2019s no sympathy in the city for her, it seems. Kenny tags along with her for part of the adventure, pointing out regularly that he\u2019s the man of the house, her big brother, and he will always take care of her. Their tight, warm relationship is the one bright spot in Lynette\u2019s extremely challenging life.",
      "Is Lynette Successful in Getting the Down Payment?",
      "After all of that, she does succeed \u2014 but then the story takes a turn. She returns home with Kenny at dawn, bleeding and beaten up, but successful. But as Doreen picks shards of glass out of her back, the truth comes out: Doreen hates the house. Doesn\u2019t want to live there. Never planned to sign the loan to make it their own.",
      "It gets worse: Doreen tells Lynette, \u201cYou\u2019re like that thing at the bottom of a toilet bowl. You just suck everything down.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a moment of clarity for Lynette, who goes upstairs to sleep and gets a voice mail from the landlord who was going to sell them the house \u2014 he\u2019s changed his mind. Suddenly, the $25,000 she\u2019s now begged, borrowed and stolen takes on a new meaning: It\u2019s freedom.",
      "But only for her. Kenny will have to stay with their mother, who refuses to let him go.",
      "How Does \u2018Night Always Comes\u2019 End?",
      "Lynette tells Kenny she has to go away, but will come back to visit. After packing, she slips into her car (we\u2019d kind of hoped she\u2019d take her mom\u2019s brand-new vehicle, but that might get her into serious trouble).",
      "She leaves some money for Kenny and a note for her mother which reads in part, \u201cYou asked me what I did last night. I fought. I fought for this family. The only way I know how. But I guess you said what I needed to hear, so thank you. And now I need to fight for me.\u201d",
      "With that, Lynette drives off into the morning, into an uncertain \u2014 but somehow more hopeful \u2014 future."

      "After 33 episodes (preceded by 94 episodes of \u201cSex and the City\u201d), Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and their assorted pals and fashions closed the wardrobe doors on Aug. 14 with a lot of loose threads tying up, many still left open and so much pie being eaten.",
      "The announcement of \u201cAJLT\u2019s\u201d exit came only a few weeks ago, when renewal buzz was still in the air. As showrunner Michael Patrick King (who developed the follow-up series with \u201cSATC\u201d creator Darren Starr) wrote on Instagram Aug. 1, \u201cWhile I was writing the last episode of \u2018And Just Like That\u2019 season three, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop.\u201d He noted that the last two episodes of the series were structured as more of a two-part finale (focusing around Miranda\u2019s challenging Thanksgiving party), but held off on calling it a finale.",
      "So how did things ultimately wrap up? Where do our leading ladies and men leave us? And just how did we go from Cosmos in clubs in the 1990s to pie in the kitchen in 2025? Let\u2019s examine the final episode, appropriately called \u201cParty of One.\u201d",
      "Are Carrie and Aidan Broken Up Forever?",
      "Considering that \u201cCadian\u201d broke up several episodes ago, that the first of the two-part finale was called \u201cForgot About the Boy,\u201d and the episode directly post-breakup skipped ahead to the fall without a reunion \u2014 yeah, it\u2019s safe to say that Aidan (John Corbett) sealed his fate when he declared he still couldn\u2019t trust Carrie.",
      "Who\u2019s next for Carrie, then?",
      "Maybe no one.",
      "The final episode of \u201cAJLT\u201d focuses on Carrie coming up with a new perspective on what it means to be not just out of a relationship, not just with none on the horizon, but what it might mean to not necessarily want one.",
      "\u201cSeriously though, who will I be alone?\u201d she asks Charlotte. \u201cI\u2019ve never lived alone without the thought that I wouldn\u2019t be alone for long.\u201d She confesses that after Big\u2019s death, she thought that Aidan might be her natural next step. Then she\u2019d considered Duncan as a possibility \u2014 but he left New York City, and it\u2019s hard to imagine Carrie picking up and following him.",
      "Then Carrie had her big revelation: \u201cI have to quit thinking, \u2018Maybe a man?\u2019 and start accepting maybe just me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a tragedy, it\u2019s a fact, and I just have to start accepting it full stop.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a throwback to her new novel, whose original ending of a woman being happy being alone triggered her editor, leading to Carrie writing an epilogue in which love is a possibility for the single woman in the future. But in the end, post-Thanksgiving, Carrie returns to her apartment with leftover pie and rewrites the epilogue to read, \u201cThe woman realized she was not alone \u2014 she was on her own.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a solid period on the end of a sentence. The fact is, after many years of the story of Carrie, her friends and lovers, our heroine\u2019s longest-lasting relationship has not been with men. Or fashion. Or even her friends. Carrie\u2019s real love affair has been with herself, and her writing. It is the thing that gives her purpose and sets her apart from nearly everyone else she knows.",
      "What Happens to All the Other Characters?",
      "So where does that leave everyone else?",
      "With their loved ones, actually. As ever, the \u201cSex\u201d-iverse leaves everyone else as ancillary satellites circling Carrie\u2019s world, but we do get some insights as to where everyone else\u2019s mostly-happily-ever-after lives are heading next.",
      "Lisa (Nicole Ari Parker) avoids her affair with her editor and comes home to a still-mourning Herbert (Christopher Jackson) and they promise to get through his political defeat together.",
      "Miranda and Joy (Dolly Wells) undergo a dog surgery and a particularly disgusting post-Thanksgiving bathroom disaster and end up embracing.",
      "Seema (Sarita Choudhury) and Adam (Logan Marshall-Green) work around their differences in tradition and gluten, and have a pie-eating Thursday instead of a traditional Thanksgiving. But not before Carrie determines that the free spirit is in for the long haul with Seema.",
      "Brady (Niall Cunningham) and baby mama-to-be Mia (Ella Stiller, daughter of Ben) are far from reconciled, but Mia and her friends do make Miranda\u2019s Thanksgiving interesting, and Mia decides that Miranda is kind of cool after all.",
      "Charlotte and Harry (Evan Handler) discover there is life after prostate cancer surgery, and celebrate Thanksgiving with their children.",
      "Anthony (Mario Cantone) and Giuseppe (Sebastiano Pigazzi) discuss Giuseppe\u2019s real intentions with Anthony. Guess they really are going to get married.",
      "Aidan is nowhere in sight.",
      "Is 'And Just Like That' Really Over?",
      "Was this a true finale \u2014 or will we see more of Carrie & Co. in the future?",
      "Too soon to tell. There are enough loose threads to create another spin-off. There\u2019s always a scenario where Carrie abandons her newfound sense of self and races off to the UK to chase Duncan. But let\u2019s face it, the end credits roll with a replay of the theme music to \u201cSex and the City.\u201d We think this is probably the end \u2014 for now.",
      "After all, Carrie has reached a point of acceptance of being alone, but not lonely. She has her friends and their offspring. She likes her home, even if it is a little too big. It\u2019s kind of nice to leave her in her beautiful red frock, dancing to Barry White\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re the First, the Last, My Everything,\u201d eating pie direct from the pan with a spoon.",
      "It\u2019s as if the show is saying: This is not a tragedy. This is a victory.",

      "The term refers to the persistent notion that celebrity deaths come in threes. The \u201c30 Rock\u201d episode \u201cStone Mountain\u201d riffs on the idea by making Tracy Jordan fear for his life after he learns two other celebrities have died.",

Religious imagery of the father, the son and the holy spirit. The three states of matter: Solid, liquid and gas. The list goes on (and on).",
      "Eck, who studies how the brain creates memory, says three holds significance for pattern-making. For example, with a string of digits, a person would assume understand that the digits one, two and three would keep going ad infinitum. The pattern of only one and two would be less clear.",
      "\u201cThree is the place where the pattern reveals itself. You can understand the pattern, but it\u2019s not it\u2019s not excessive,\u201d he says. \u201cThree is a perfect upper limit to absorb things.\u201d",
      "When applied to celebrity deaths, Eck says, we reach for three to create a sense of \u201ccompletion\u201d of a cycle.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 As U.S. television series produce longer and fewer episodes, a new genre from China is gaining American fans by going in the opposite direction.",
      "Known as minidramas, micro dramas or vertical dramas, they are soap operas condensed into a minute or two per episode.",
      "Each show, reminiscent of a telenovela, is split into dozens of chapters, each about two minutes long and with all the soapy elements: cheesy romance, over-the-top drama and abundant cliff-hangers.",
      "\u201cThe revenge ones, oh, my God, they\u2019re so good,\u201d California-based retail business owner Jacarius Murphy told NBC News in a video interview.",
      "Murphy is a fan of the minidramas, known as duanju in Chinese, which focus heavily on romance, revenge and fantasy. The stories tend to involve wealthy characters such as a chief executive who\u2019s secretly a vampire or a billionaire living a double life \u2014 characters often played by American actors.",
      "\u201cPeople want this fast dopamine hit, and they can snack on it while they\u2019re waiting,\u201d said Anina Net, an American actress based in Los Angeles who has worked on minidramas for the past four years.",
      "The genre originated in China, where production companies have tapped into the popularity of short-form, vertical-produced, TikTok-style video content. About half of China\u2019s 1.4 billion people consume dramas in this style, according to a report released in March by the state-owned China Netcasting Services Association.",
      "The industry made $6.9 billion in revenue last year, more than China\u2019s total box office sales.",
      "The shows are \u201cstill quite limited in genre, mostly romance-focused, with sweet, domineering CEO tropes and modern settings,\u201d said Kaidi Dai, a Shanghai-based minidrama producer.",
      "Now, having figured out the Chinese market, the same companies are expanding into the U.S., where minidramas are finding success just a few years after the failure of Quibi, a short-lived, short-form mobile streaming service. The shows are available on platforms such as ReelShort, DramaBox and GoodShort, which offers free episodes and in-app purchases as well as subscriptions.",
      "Minidramas cost far less to make than standard TV shows and can make millions of dollars in revenue through a combination of user purchases and advertising. But adapting them to the U.S. market takes some tweaking, said Chinese filmmaker Gao Feng, also known as Frank Tian, who has a minidrama production company based in New York.",
      "Rather than remaking Chinese shows, his company hired longtime U.S. residents to craft stories that would appeal to American audiences.",
      "\u201cI believe that scripts determine 65-70% of a project\u2019s success,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cApart from werewolves, CEO romances and hidden identities, we should explore new genres.\u201d",
      "While many short dramas have been based on successful Chinese stories, \u201cif a platform cannot innovate continuously, it will face significant challenges,\u201d he added.",
      "Among the most popular shows is \u201cThe Double Life of My Billionaire Husband,\u201d which tells the story of a woman whose husband is better off financially than he appears. All 60 episodes can be viewed in less than 70 minutes on ReelShort, the California-based, Chinese-backed minidrama platform that released it in 2023.",
      "\u201cHilariously bad, oddly addictive,\u201d reads one IMDb review of the show, which had more than 485 million views on ReelShort as of Friday.",
      "The Chinese-backed short-video app has vied with TikTok as the most popular product in the entertainment section of Apple\u2019s U.S. app store.",
      "\u201cThe short videos on TikTok have laid a solid foundation for the popularity of short dramas,\u201d Yan Min, who helped organize an industry conference in China last year, said in an interview.",
      "Min said ReelShort and other companies were advertising on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok to attract new users, catering to the \u201cevolving viewing habits of younger generations, who have grown up with platforms like TikTok and are accustomed to short, engaging content.\u201d",
      "U.S. entertainment companies have taken notice of the trend. Netflix said in May that it was testing a vertical feed made up of clips from its shows and movies, while Disney said last month that it was investing in DramaBox through its accelerator program.",
      "Though minidramas seeking U.S. audiences are increasingly using actors with American backgrounds, they often shoot in scenic Chinese locations like the coastal city of Qingdao, with its Western-style villas and architecture, for greater authenticity.",
      "\u201cWe seek actors and screenwriters who grew up in the U.S. and naturally embody an American style. Then we incorporate some Chinese elements,\u201d said Ann An, a Beijing-based freelance producer for several minidramas made for foreign audiences.",
      "Turnarounds are incredibly fast in the industry as producers strive to keep costs low. An said a show can finish filming in 10 days, with a budget of under $70,000.",
      "The biggest key to the success of minidramas, though, is the cliff-hangers, which push viewers to keep paying for the next episode.",
      "\u201cThe scriptwriters know exactly where to place these cliff-hangers, and they execute them very well,\u201d said Apple Yang, a minidrama director based in London.",
      "That helps explain the appeal of minidramas even if their overall quality is sometimes \u201cunderwhelming,\u201d said Ying Zhu, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film.",
      "\u201cMake the dialogue real and less mechanic. Make it funny when possible and biting when needed,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cOne minute can pack in a lot of info if done well.\u201d"

      "The unauthorized biography, \"Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York\" by Andrew Lownie, was published Thursday.",
      "It centers on Andrew\u2019s relationship with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, and covers his finances and dealings with foreign governments, as well as the timeline of his ties with Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 the late financier and convicted sex offender who has been the subject of fervent attention in both Britain and the United States in recent weeks.",
      "NBC royal contributor Daisy McAndrew said Thursday that the good news for Andrew and the royal family may be that the impact of this renewed focus will be blunted by the reality that his reputation is already at \u201crock bottom.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible other people might well be taking some of the heat off Andrew,\u201d she said, referring to politicians in the U.S.",
      "Publisher HarperCollins says Lownie, a historian, drew on four years of research and interviews with more than 100 people who haven\u2019t spoken before in writing the 448-page book. The majority spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Excerpts have been splashed across Britain's Daily Mail newspaper, and a poll released this week found that two-thirds of Britons want the disgraced younger brother of King Charles III to be stripped of his remaining royal titles.",
      "An earlier YouGov survey found Andrew remains by far the most unpopular royal, with just 5% of respondents saying they held a positive view of him.",
      "Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, formerly known as Meghan Markle, was one place above Andrew, at 20%, with heir to the throne Prince William topping the rankings on 74%.",
      "A representative for Andrew and Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment about both the book and the polling.",
      "Andrew returned his military affiliations and royal patronages in January 2022 after his lawyers failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse.",
      "He later paid a substantial sum to Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew sexually abused her when she was 17. Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegation.",
      "Giuffre died by suicide in April this year, with her family saying in a statement that \u201cthe toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight.\u201d",
      "In December 2024, Andrew was caught up in an alleged spying case after cultivating an \u201cunusual degree of trust\u201d with a Chinese man who was barred from the U.K. on national security grounds.",
      "Britain\u2019s High Court ruled that Andrew had been \u201cprepared to enter into business activities\u201d with Yang Tengbo as it lifted an anonymity order protecting Tengbo's identity. Tengbo had been subjected to the highest levels of national security investigation in the U.K.",
      "Other royals have rarely appeared in public with Andrew since his fall from grace.",
      "His public standing has remained little changed since a disastrous interview about his ties to Epstein on the BBC\u2019s \u201cNewsnight\u201d program in November 2019.",
      "Despite this simmering anger and growing pressure, McAndrew said she doesn't think the king will take the drastic step of removing Andrew's royal titles. But, she said, William might act differently when he ascends the throne.",
      "\"He\u2019s much less sentimental as a personality. And the royal family (and future monarch peculiarly) ultimately must exist to protect the monarchy,\" she said.",
      "The royal family will have to consider whether taking new action against Andrew could run the risk of him retaliating publicly. They may feel it is better, McAndrew said, \"to let sleeping dogs lie.\""

    "story": [
      "Arab governments that for decades have been fierce advocates for the Palestinian cause are now facing criticism for their timid response to the extreme suffering in Gaza caused by Israel's war, risking a dangerous rift with their increasingly restive citizens.",
      "As deaths from starvation and Israeli bombardment have mounted, Palestinians, their supporters and some analysts have directed their anger toward Arab rulers in the region whom they perceive as being too passive and quiet. They point to countries outside the Middle East who have publicly criticized Israel and tried to stop it from expanding its military operations in Gaza.",
      "\u201cWhere are the Arabs? The Arabs are napping. The Arabs are nowhere to be seen. The Arabs, and I\u2019m talking about the Arab rulers, have buried their heads in the sand,\u201d said Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.",
      "The situation in Gaza has become even more dire as Palestinians risk their lives to get food. An aid distribution system implemented by the U.S. and the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has led to hundreds more Palestinians being killed, often by Israeli soldiers.",
      "Wafaa Eeed, a Palestinian woman in Gaza, told NBC News last month that she had walked several miles to a GHF aid distribution site on July 24, a day set aside only for women. She and two other witnesses said they were shot at, pepper-sprayed and tear-gassed.",
      "\u201cArab states, why don\u2019t you help us? We don\u2019t want the Americans,\u201d Eeed said.",
      "Two women were killed on their way to the site, a Gaza health official said. The GHF said at the time that there were \u201cno incidents\u201d at the site itself.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said that \"troops operating in the Rafah area identified suspects who approached them, posing a threat to the troops\" and fired warning shots.",
      "It was not aware of casualties, and the shots were fired \"hundreds of meters away\" from the GHF site before its opening hours, it said.",
      "Israel also denies there is starvation in Gaza, contradicting medics in the Palestinian enclave, global aid groups and even a close ally, President Donald Trump.",
      "Some Arab leaders dependent on American aid and security guarantees are wary of angering the U.S. and Israel and see little strategic advantage in helping Palestinians, whom they may even see as a threat, experts say.",
      "Arab states have participated in airdrops of aid and food convoys into Gaza, but Palestinians and aid groups say it\u2019s nowhere near enough to ward off a looming famine. Egypt and Qatar have also mediated talks among Israel, the U.S. and Hamas, but they have not led to an end to the conflict.",
      "Several Latin American states, along with Spain, Ireland and Norway, have blasted Israel for its conduct in Gaza and threatened sanctions or a downgrade of diplomatic ties.",
      "And in recent weeks, longtime Israeli allies like France and Australia have pledged to officially recognize Palestine \u2014 a move decried by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government. In late 2023, South Africa filed a case with the United Nations\u2019 top court alleging that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.",
      "Arab states have been much less vocal, with Egypt and Jordan even cracking down on pro-Palestinian protests and activism, fearing they could turn against the country\u2019s leaders, experts say.",
      "\u201cPalestine resonates deeply in the Arab imagination,\" Gerges said. \"Palestine reminds Arabs of the subservience of their governments. Palestine reminds Arabs of the hegemony and domination and the continuing colonialism and imperialism of the West.\"",
      "He added, \u201cI would say that Gaza, the tragedy of Gaza, the destruction of Gaza, could really serve as a time bomb that implodes the Arab political order from within.\u201d",
      "Polling before Oct. 7, 2023, showed that most Arab citizens rejected normalizing ties with Israel, a sentiment subsequent surveys show has only deepened since.",
      "A survey published in June by pollster Arab Barometer found that support for such a move has collapsed, not exceeding 13 percent in the seven countries surveyed.",
      "The Egyptian and Jordanian embassies in the U.S., along with the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this story.",
      "Egypt and Jordan, even with the crackdown, have allowed limited protests, though hundreds of activists have also been arrested, according to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.",
      "The Gulf states rarely allow protests, but they have largely maintained diplomatic and trade links with Israel throughout its devastating offensive in the Gaza strip that began after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, in which some 1,200 were killed and 250 taken hostage.",
      "Health officials in Gaza say that more than 61,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in the ensuing war.",
      "Many academics, including Israeli scholars, have in recent months joined rights groups in condemning Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza as genocide, a charge Israel vehemently denies.",
      "\u201cDespite the genocide, in the middle of the genocide, this extraordinary depravity that we see in Gaza, not a single Arab state that has relations with Israel has cut relations with Israel, although other states in other parts of the world have,\u201d said Ussama Makdisi, professor of history and chancellor\u2019s chair at the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were among the Arab states that signed the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020, paving the way for economic and diplomatic ties with Israel. Saudi Arabia had been set to follow, but the Gaza conflict put those plans on hold.",
      "For Gulf Arab states, better ties with Israel have little to do with public attitudes and more to do with realpolitik, experts say. The Gulf states host several U.S. military bases that analysts say help shield them from regional rival Iran and also help maintain Western access to the region\u2019s vast energy supplies.",
      "Access to Israel\u2019s vibrant tech sector has also been a draw for some Arab states, who have used its surveillance technology to stifle dissent, experts and rights groups say.",
      "\u201cThose regimes in the Arab world that depend on the U.S. for their security, they don\u2019t depend on their legitimacy vis a vis their own people. They depend on U.S. protection, U.S. military bases,\u201d Makdisi said.",
      "Houthi rebels, who control large parts of Yemen, have fired missiles and drones at Israel and ships in the region in what they say is an attempt to end Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, but Yemen is alone among Arab states in pressuring Israel militarily. Arab countries could apply economic pressure through oil embargoes or restricting access to the Suez Canal and Arab airspace, but experts say such moves are unlikely.",
      "Arab countries once supplied Palestinian militant groups with weapons, funding and bases from which to attack Israel, but such solidarity proved costly and dangerous.",
      "In Jordan, tensions between Palestinian militant groups and the ruling monarchy exploded into the \u201cBlack September\u201d civil war in 1970, leading to the militants\u2019 eventual expulsion and relocation to Lebanon.",
      "The presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon in the 1970s exacerbated the country\u2019s civil war and triggered an Israeli invasion in 1982 to target \u201cPalestinian terrorists.\u201d",
      "More recently, Israel invaded Lebanon last year, heavily bombing southern Beirut in an offensive against the Hezbollah militant group, which had been firing rockets at Israel in solidarity with Hamas.",
      "Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, which has led some Arab states to distance themselves from both groups.",
      "For Ryan Crocker, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Lebanon and Kuwait, lukewarm Arab support for the Palestinian cause is less about U.S. and Israeli pressure and more about self-preservation.",
      "\u201cThe Palestinians, both the cause, the PLO and the population, in the Jordanian and Lebanese examples, have both been seen as a threat to the rule of these Arab regimes,\u201d Crocker told NBC News.",
      "The U.S. and Israel had floated plans for Arab countries to accept tens of thousands of Gaza refugees, but the idea was flatly rejected, with those Arab countries fearing both renewed Palestinian militancy and accusations of aiding ethnic cleansing, experts say.",
      "Crocker compared Palestinians to the Kurds, another stateless group in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a saying among the Kurds, who are scattered between Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, that they have no friends but the mountains,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, the Palestinians don\u2019t even have the mountains.\u201d"

      "\"This decision will help make sure that hundreds of thousands of Canadians and visitors to our country are not impacted because of canceled flights,\" Hajdu said.",

      "It\u2019s unclear when a deal might be reached. Air Canada Chief Operating Officer Mark Nasr cautioned that even after coming to an agreement, it could take up to a week to fully restart operations.",
      "All Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flights remain canceled until at least Sunday afternoon, the airline said in a statement.",
      "Hajdu\u2019s invocation of Section 107 of the Canadian labor code effectively orders workers to continue their regular duties until an agreement is reached. However, CUPE's Air Canada Component said in a Facebook post early Sunday that the strike was still on.",

Zelenskyy may be invited to the next round of talks, but for many watching this meeting between Trump and Putin, it may seem clear who has the upper hand.",
      "Friday\u2019s meeting wasn\u2019t the first time a Russian and American president rode together in the presidential limo. In 2010, President Barack Obama and President Dmitry Medvedev both rode in the Beast to have lunch at Ray\u2019s Hell Burger in Arlington, Virginia.",
      "But Medvedev, unlike Trump, had not been accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court, nor was he involved in a conflict that critics have called a blatant land grab."

      "Those demands have previously included Ukraine ceding all the land that Putin claims to have annexed and accepting permanent neutrality, with a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO. Putin claims four Ukrainian regions \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014, although Russian forces do not fully control all of the territory in each region.",

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2014 Toward the end of Donald Trump\u2019s first term, his national security adviser turned to him in the Oval Office and said he should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his work normalizing relations between Israel and some Arab states.",
      "Another aide chimed in, saying the last president, Barack Obama, had won the award \u201cfor nothing.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s attitude was, \u2018Whatever,\u2019\u201d recalled the adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, in an interview. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t concerned about the recognition.\u201d",
      "Any whiff of indifference is now gone. Back in office, Trump and his aides are intensifying a public campaign to snag the award, citing a string of peace deals while making a case that snubbing him again would be an injustice.",
      "Day by day, the White House is amplifying Trump's role in curbing hostilities and putting out the message that this most combative of presidents is at heart a \"peacemaker.\"",
      "Aides have highlighted his role in settling disputes between Israel and Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Cambodia and Thailand, and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, promoting \"worldwide calls\" from the heads of several of those nations for Trump to win the peace prize.",
      "Trump is also touting his efforts to end a worrying conflict between two nuclear-armed combatants, India and Pakistan. He suggested he used trade as an inducement to stop the fighting, though an Indian official has denied that Trump's mediation made any difference.",
      "Speaking last month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the president has \u201cbrokered, on average, about one peace deal or ceasefire per month during his six months in office. It\u2019s well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d she added.",
      "A difference between this term and the last is that now, \u201che actually wants it,\" a senior official in Trump\u2019s first term said about the Nobel Peace Prize, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t just want to talk about it.\u201d",
      "Now comes his best shot. On Friday, Trump will fly to Alaska for a sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin aimed at ending a war with Ukraine that has produced close to 1.5 million casualties on both sides.",
      "The odds of a breakthrough are tough, but if Trump brokers a truce on terms that are fair to Ukraine, that would be a diplomatic triumph that eluded both Obama and President Joe Biden.",
      "In the run-up to the summit, the Nobel prize has appeared to be top of mind in Trump's circle. Without prompting, Leavitt  portrayed Trump as deserving of the prize in three out of her four press briefings in July. In prior months, she hadn\u2019t brought up the award.",
      "Trump has posted about the prize a total of seven times on his social media site since his second term began, six of them in June and July. A theme of his is that while he\u2019s earned the accolade, he won\u2019t win it.",
      "\u201cThe president feels that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, but does not think he will get it,\u201d a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe has remarked that it will go to someone who writes a book about how Donald Trump thinks rather than Donald Trump himself.\u201d",
      "In a visit to the White House in April, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re was asked about Trump\u2019s prospects of winning the award, announced annually in Oslo.",
      "He didn\u2019t bite.",
      "\u201cOn that prize, that is a committee taking care of that which is completely working on its own terms and I cannot comment on that,\u201d St\u00f8re said.",
      "Trump smiled and looked across the Cabinet Room table at the prime minister: \u201cI like that question,\u201d he said.",
      "The award is solely in the hands of the Nobel selection committee; politicians don\u2019t pick the winner. But Trump has reportedly raised the issue with Norway before. Last month, he called the country\u2019s finance minister, former NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, to talk tariffs and brought up the peace prize, a Norwegian news outlet wrote Thursday.",
      "The White House official said that the president and Stoltenberg did speak, but could not say that the conversation was focused on the prize. Stoltenberg confirmed in a statement that he spoke to Trump about tariffs but would not go into further details of the call.",
      "Trump is surrounded by reminders of past presidents who\u2019ve won what is arguably humanity\u2019s most prestigious award.

      "Just a few paces from the Oval Office, Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Nobel Prize is on display, signifying both the challenge and opportunity that Trump faces. Roosevelt won in 1906 for bringing an end to another Russian conflict: a war with Japan.",
      "As much as he aligns himself politically with working Americans, Trump has long been attuned to elite opinion. He takes pride in recounting that his late uncle, John Trump, taught at the acclaimed Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has described his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, as \u201cthe hardest school to get into, the best school in the world.\u201d",
      "In announcing the Kennedy Center honorees on Wednesday, Trump said that he had long wanted one for himself. The president now plans to host the Kennedy Center Honors this year, teasing to reporters, \"maybe ... next year we\u2019ll honor Trump.\"",
      "A Nobel Peace Prize would be the ultimate validation.",
      "\"If the Israel-Hamas/Iran and Russia-Ukraine conflicts get resolved, there\u2019s no way that they can\u2019t give President Trump the Nobel Peace Prize,\" O'Brien said.",
      "\u201cThe Nobel committee may not like Trump,\" he added. \"They may not like his personality. They may not like his populism, but if the award has any meaning, they have to give it to him.\u201d",
      "Of course, the Nobel selection committee has its own ideas about what it takes to win. The five-member body appointed by the Norwegian parliament may be weighing other criteria apart from the peace deals the White House has tallied.",
      "In his will, Alfred Nobel stated that the prize should go to those \u201cwho shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations.\u201d",
      "Since Trump took office, some longtime U.S. allies have seen fraternal bonds fray. Trump has rolled out stiff tariffs in pursuit of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda meant to create more jobs at home. He stunned various world capitals with his calls for acquiring Greenland, Canada and the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize has become something of a joke in foreign capitals,\u201d a former British diplomat said. \u201cHis claims to Canada, Panama, Greenland, etc., as well as tariff wars and the assaults on America\u2019s democratic institutions, incline governments in the opposite direction.\u201d",
      "What happens in the Nobel committee\u2019s closed-door deliberations is a closely guarded secret. The panel accepts nominations through the end of January and announces the winner in October. It waits 50 years before revealing even a list of nominees.",
      "Handicapping possible winners of the 2025 prize, a Norwegian think tank didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s name. The handful of front-runners the group cited included \u201cSudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms,\u201d the prime minister of Qatar, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, and the Women\u2019s International League for Peace & Freedom.",
      "It\u2019s far from clear that the Nobel committee is susceptible to persuasion. Pressure, publicity and coalition-building work in politics, the arena Trump knows well. But the Nobel committee is insulated from that world.",
      "The prize \u201cis not something you campaign for,\u201d a Western diplomat said. \u201cThis is a decision made by people who are independent and have their own point of view. You can\u2019t buy it. Norway doesn\u2019t need the money.\u201d",
      "Last week, Trump held a meeting at the White House with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to mark a rapprochement between the two countries. Questioned by a reporter, both leaders plumped for Trump\u2019s Nobel candidacy.",
      "Nikol Pashinyan, prime minister of Armenia, said, \u201cWe will promote for that.\u201d",
      "Turning to Trump, he said, \u201cHopefully you will invite us\u201d to the award ceremony.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 The marathon national security trial of pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai is nearing conclusion in Hong Kong as President Donald Trump vowed to \u201cdo everything I can to save\u201d the media tycoon from what critics say is political persecution by Chinese authorities.",
      "Closing arguments in the landmark trial, which began in December 2023, were set to begin this week after a five-month break following the end of Lai\u2019s testimony in March. But they were postponed twice on Thursday and Friday, first due to a severe thunderstorm that closed courts and then to allow time for Lai, who has complained of heart palpitations, to receive medication and a portable heart monitor.",
      "They are expected to resume Monday and last about 10 days, with a verdict by the three handpicked judges coming in October at the earliest.",
      "Lai, a 77-year-old British citizen who is one of the Chinese territory\u2019s most prominent democrats, was arrested in August 2020 under a Beijing-imposed national security law over his role in mass anti-government protests in 2019 that sometimes turned violent. He has since spent almost 1,700 days in solitary confinement, during which time his son says his health has declined significantly.",
      "Lai has pleaded not guilty to two national security charges of conspiring to collude with foreign forces and a third count under colonial-era legislation of publishing seditious materials in Apple Daily, his now-defunct pro-democracy tabloid. If convicted, he could face life in prison.",
      "The U.S. and other governments have criticized the case as politically motivated and called for Lai\u2019s immediate release. Trump said Thursday that he would \u201cdo everything I can to save him\u201d in talks with Chinese officials, even if Chinese President Xi Jinping \u201cwould not be exactly thrilled\u201d to let him go.",
      "Trump appeared to be softening a claim he made about Lai last year, when he said on a podcast that \u201c100%, I\u2019ll get him out\u201d of China and that it would be \u201cso easy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t say 100% I\u2019d save him. I said 100% I\u2019m going to be bringing it up. And I\u2019ve already brought it up,\u201d Trump said Thursday in an interview with Fox News Radio, without giving details.",
      "The government of Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, said Wednesday that Lai was receiving a fair trial and accused \u201cexternal forces\u201d of trying to interfere in Hong Kong courts. Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials say the national security law and related local legislation were necessary to restore stability in the international financial hub after the protests.",
      "With a verdict still weeks away, the hearing on Friday drew fewer people than rulings and sentencings in recent cases such as the sedition trial against two Stand News journalists or the subversion trial against 47 pro-democracy politicians and activists.",
      "But members of the public still lined up hours before the hearing amid heavy police presence to secure seats in the main courtroom and catch a glimpse of Lai.",
      "First in line was local activist Lui Yuk-lin, who arrived before 1 a.m. and said she was concerned about Lai\u2019s health.",
      "\u201cHe used to have a big belly. But after many years in jail, it\u2019s now gone,\u201d said Lui, who wore a T-shirt bearing the American flag and the words \u201cLand of the Free.\u201d",
      "Members of the public gallery waved at Lai, wearing a white windbreaker and thick-rimmed black glasses, as he appeared in the courtroom Friday in a glassed-in area surrounded by four guards. Lai smiled and waved back at supporters.",
      "Western diplomats were also in attendance.",
      "During his 52 days of testimony, Lai denied allegations that he lobbied the U.S. to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China. He said that while Apple Daily held anti-communist views, he did not use the media outlet to promote Hong Kong independence.",
      "Lai also referred to himself as a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d at least twice during questioning, drawing fierce rebukes from the bench.",
      "Lai has already been convicted in three separate cases related to unauthorized assembly and is serving five years and nine months in prison over a 2022 fraud conviction, cases that have also been criticized as politically motivated.",
      "Spectators waved again as Lai exited the courtroom on Friday.",
      "\u201cI hope his family can stay strong and bold,\u201d Lui said. \u201cWe support him.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Russia's Vladimir Putin sounded positive Thursday on the eve of  his talks with President Donald Trump in Alaska, saying he believed the American leader was making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts\" toward peace in Ukraine.",
      "A day ahead of their summit, Putin convened a meeting of advisers to inform them \"about how the negotiation process on the Ukrainian crisis is going,\" the Kremlin said in a readout translated by NBC News.",
      "The Russian leader said the Trump administration is making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict.\"",
      "Those efforts are intended \"to create long-term conditions of peace between our countries and in Europe, and in the world as a whole,\" he added, particularly if the negotiations are extended to cover strategic offensive weapons treaties.",
      "This suggests that a deal on nuclear arms control could be part of the talks. Russia suspended its participation in the New START \"reduction in strategic offensive arms\" agreement in 2023.",
      "Earlier Thursday, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said the summit would start with head-to-head talks between Trump, Putin and their translators at 11:30 a.m. local time (3:30 p.m. ET) and would be followed by a joint news conference. The White House later confirmed this.",
      "Trump \"wants to exhaust all options to try to bring this war to a peaceful resolution,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.",
      "The top-level Russian delegation will include Putin, Ushakov, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Putin's longtime friend and investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev, Ushakov said on a call with journalists in Moscow.",
      "The primary topic of the meeting will be Ukraine, he said, but he added that he expected the \"huge, and unfortunately hitherto untapped, potential\" of economic ties between the U.S. and Russia would also be discussed.",
      "As well as Putin's openly stated goal of subjugating Ukraine, he also wants to end Russia's exile from the Western financial system following economic sanctions imposed by Washington, the European Union and others. Trump has not yet lifted these punishments but has expressed a desire to end Russia's economic pariah status.",
      "NBC News asked Trump in a press gaggle on Thursday whether he would offer Putin access to rare earth minerals as an incentive to end the war with Ukraine.",
      "\"We\u2019re going to see what happens with our meeting. We have a big meeting. It\u2019s going to be, I think, very important for Russia, and it\u2019s going to be very important for us,\" Trump said, without offering additional details. He later added that the earth minerals are \u201cvery unimportant\u201d compared to \u201ctrying to save lives.\u201d",
      "The talks come as Ukraine marked a grim new record with 286 civilians killed and 1,388 injured in July, according to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cFor the second month in a row, the number of civilian casualties in Ukraine hits a new three-year high,\u201d Danielle Bell, the head of the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cOnly the first three months after the Russian Federation launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine saw more killed and injured than in this past month.\u201d",
      "The Trump-Putin summit has prompted howls of dismay and anxiety across Ukraine and Europe, which have not been invited to the talks and fear what the American president may agree to with his Russian counterpart about the conflict raging on their continent.",
      "They have been confined to their own diplomatic scrambling, including dozens of calls between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other leaders, culminating in a video call between these parties and Trump himself Wednesday.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Putin \u201cis bluffing\u201d in saying he wants peace.",
      "On Thursday, the Ukrainian leader flew to London and met his British counterpart, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, for what both called a \"productive meeting.\" As well as the prospect of Britain financing the small drones that have become central to Ukraine's battlefield defense, the pair discussed the Alaska talks, \"which present a viable chance to make progress as long as Putin takes action to prove he is serious about peace,\" a spokesperson from Starmer's office, No. 10 Downing St., said in a statement.",
      "After Wednesday's call with Zelenskyy, Starmer and others, Trump said he had assured them that there would be \"very severe consequences\" \u2014 without elaborating what those might be \u2014 if Putin did not agree to end the war during their sit-down discussion.",
      "Two European officials and three other people briefed on the call told NBC News that he told them he would not discuss possible divisions of territory with the man flying in from the Kremlin."

      "Trump and European leaders agreed that a ceasefire in Ukraine has to be implemented before peace negotiations can begin, the European officials and two other people briefed on the call said. Some of the European leaders were left with the impression from the call that Trump is not optimistic about the results of his meeting with Putin, they added.",
      "The call on Wednesday took place just days ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin, which is planned for Friday. European and Ukrainian officials have been nervous about the president\u2019s meeting with the Russian leader since he announced it last week. Among their concerns is that Trump and Putin might agree to the parameters of a peace deal, including territorial divisions, and then try to pressure Ukraine to agree to it. Trump\u2019s comments last week that there would \"be some land swapping\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, in particular, put Zelenskyy and European leaders on edge.",
      "But the two European officials and three other people briefed on Wednesday\u2019s call said all the leaders agreed that Ukraine must be included in negotiations and should be the one to decide what territorial concessions it might be willing to make. They also said the leaders were united in their belief that if Putin does not agree to a ceasefire, Trump will likely levy new sanctions on Russia.",
      "Two additional people familiar with Wednesday\u2019s call said European leaders left feeling positive about Trump\u2019s plans for his meeting with Putin. One of them said achieving a ceasefire is expected to be the priority for Trump in the meeting. The other person expressed confidence that Ukrainian territory would not be negotiated without Ukraine.",
      "A European official said there was still concern that the president could shift his position yet again once he is in the room with Putin, especially as he has so far proven reluctant to put concrete pressure on Russia and follow through on threats of additional sanctions.",
      "\u201cSometimes these positions change and get revised in a matter of hours,\u201d one European official said.",
      "European governments and Ukraine are also anxious about how the aftermath of the meeting would be handled, that European official said, and whether the details of what was discussed or agreed would be clearly explained or addressed in a joint statement.",
      "In response to a request for comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"The White House does not discuss details of the President\u2019s private diplomatic conversations. However, President Trump has been clear that he wants to end this war and stop the killing, and Friday\u2019s meeting with President Putin will serve as an important moment in this process.\u201d",
      "Trump said Wednesday after the call that it was \u201cvery good\u201d and suggested that another meeting involving Zelenskyy could quickly follow his sit-down with Putin.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a very good chance that we\u2019re going to have a second meeting, which will be more productive than the first, because the first is I\u2019m going to find out where we are and what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI would like to do it almost immediately, and we\u2019ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself, if they\u2019d like to have me there.\u201d",
      "The president also said Russia will face \u201csevere consequences\u201d if Putin doesn\u2019t agree to end the war.",
      "Vice President JD Vance assured Zelenskyy and European allies on the call that the U.S. would not negotiate with Russia about a solution for the war in Ukraine without Ukraine or without Europe, according to two German government officials involved.",
      "Vance said afterward during remarks to U.S. troops at RAF Fairford in the U.K. that \u201cone of our most important shared security goals in Europe\u201d is ending the war in Ukraine."

      "At trial, the victim testified that Alahverdian quickly became controlling and mean after she bought their rings and lent him money for rent. When she removed the ring and told him their relationship was over, they fought and he eventually assaulted her, she testified.",

      "Alahverdian pleaded no contest to misdemeanor domestic assault and was sentenced to probation.",
      "In Ohio in 2008, a woman whom Alahverdian met on MySpace accused him of sexually assaulting her while walking to class at a local community college. He denied the allegation and was charged with public indecency and sexual imposition, a misdemeanor crime indicating sexual contact against a person\u2019s will.",
      "After a trial, Alahverdian was fined and ordered to register as a sex offender.",
      "The second Utah case, also from 2008, involves a woman who said they\u2019d started dating after they met on MySpace. An affidavit in support of an arrest warrant shows that she told authorities that she broke it off after he became increasingly aggressive and borrowed money without paying her back.",
      "On Sept. 13 of that year, she said she went to his home after he said he\u2019d pay her back, according to the affidavit. He instead raped her, according to the document.",
      "A sexual assault kit was completed the next day, authorities have said, but a backlog in testing meant that Alahverdian was not identified as a suspect until a decade later. Alahverdian has pleaded not guilty in that case."

    "summary": "The IDF said it killed a man in Gaza posing as an Al Jazeera journalist, but the network said Anas al-Sharif was a journalist and that he and four other staff members were killed in a targeted Israeli airstrike.",
    "story": [
      "One of Gaza's most prominent journalists was killed along with four others in a targeted Israeli airstrike on Sunday, the network said.",
      "Anas al-Sharif's death has been condemned by the United Nations, rights organizations and journalism advocacy groups, one of which warned last month that he was being targeted with a smear campaign by the Israeli military after he cried on air over starvation in Gaza.",
      "Qatari-owned pan-Arab Al Jazeera reported that al-Sharif; another journalist, Mohammed Qreiqeh; and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa were killed \u201cin a targeted Israeli strike on a tent housing journalists in Gaza City.\u201d",
      "In a separate statement, the Al Jazeera Media Network said al-Sharif and his colleagues were stationed opposite the Al-Shifa Hospital complex.",
      "Calling it \u201canother blatant and premeditated attack on press freedom\u201d by Israel, the statement said it was \u201ca desperate attempt to silence the voices exposing the impending seizure and occupation of Gaza.\u201d It added that it held both Israel\u2019s military and government \u201cresponsible for deliberately targeting and assassinating its journalists.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that al-Sharif was \u201cthe head of a terrorist cell in the Hamas terrorist organization and was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops.\u201d",
      "It added that it had \u201cpreviously disclosed intelligence information and many documents found in the Gaza Strip\u201d that it said confirm that al-Sharif was a member of Hamas.",
      "On Monday, the Israeli military did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for evidence that he was a terrorist.",
      "Both al-Sharif and Al Jazeera have previously denied accusations that he was a terrorist.",
      "In October 2024, the IDF shared a photo on X of al-Sharif and five other Al Jazeera journalists it claimed were \u201cHamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists.\u201d The Al Jazeera Media Network called the claims \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cfabricated accusations.\u201d",
      "\u201cAl Jazeera fear these allegations may serve as a pretext for further violence against the journalists, mirroring the tragic fates of other media professionals targeted and killed by Israeli occupation forces,\u201d the media network said at the time.",
      "In a July 24 video, Israel\u2019s army spokesperson Avichay Adraee attacked Al Jazeera and accused al-Sharif of being part of Hamas\u2019 military wing, The Associated Press reported.",
      "This prompted the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists to warn that it was \u201cgravely worried\u201d about al-Sharif. In a statement it said he was \u201cbeing targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign, which he believes is a precursor to his assassination.\u201d",
      "Condemning the death of al-Sharif and his colleagues on Monday, CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah, accused Israel of \"murdering the messengers,\" adding that it \"made no claims that any of the other journalists were terrorists. That\u2019s murder. Plain and simple.\u201d",
      "The Committee to Protect Journalists says that at least 186 journalists have been killed in the conflict since the start of the war.",
      "In a separate statement the Foreign Press Association also said it was \"outraged.\"",
      "The U.N. human rights office also called a \"grave breach of international humanitarian law,\u201d while Philippe Lazzarini of the United Nations refugees agency said he was \"horrified\" by their deaths.",
      "Al Jazeera, a network funded by Qatar\u2019s government, said that 10 of its staff have been killed by Israel since Israel launched the war in Gaza in 2023.",
      "Among the dead was 27-year-old correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, who were killed last summer. Freelancer Hossam Shabat was killed in an Israeli airstrike in March.",
      "Like al-Sharif, Shabat was among the six that Israel accused of being members of militant groups last October.",
      "Blocked in Israel, the country's forces raided Al Jazeera's offices in the occupied West Bank last year, ordering them closed.",
      "And in May 2024, Israel\u2019s government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voted to shut down the channel\u2019s local offices. Netanyahu at the time called it an incitement channel.",
      "Al Jazeera has repeatedly denied the allegations of incitement made by Israel.",
      "Israel launched the offensive in Gaza, targeting Hamas, after the Hamas-led terror attacks against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 251 people were taken hostage. Many of the targets of those attacks were civilians, including people attending a music festival.",
      "Over 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the offensive began, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave."

    "summary": "Alternative for Germany has joined France's National Rally and Reform U.K. in becoming the most popular party in its country, according to polls.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 For the first time in modern history, far-right and populist parties are simultaneously topping the polls in Europe\u2019s three main economies of Germany, France and Britain.",
      "A poll Tuesday showed Alternative for Germany \u2014 which is under surveillance by the country\u2019s intelligence services over suspected extremism \u2014 is now the most favored by voters. The survey by broadcaster RTL put the AfD at 26%, ahead of the ruling Christian Democrats at 24%.",
      "This is a high watermark for the European far right, a once fringe movement whose virulently anti-immigration, anti-Islam and culture-war politics were shunned by the mainstream just a decade ago. Today, these parties have developed deep ties with President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, who openly cite nationalists such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n as inspirations on policy and tactics.",
      "For years, France\u2019s National Rally has consistently led polls ahead of the country\u2019s next presidential election in 2027. And Britain\u2019s Reform U.K., led by Trump ally and friend Nigel Farage, has since April topped most polls there.",
      "Far-right parties have been elected over the past few years into the governments of Italy, Hungary and elsewhere. The center right and the center left have hemorrhaged votes amid high inflation, fears over immigration and collapsing faith in institutions \u2014 all familiar issues in America, too.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s polling milestone is \u201ca sign of the power of populism, disinformation and the failure of established parties to understand what is happening,\u201d said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy and international development at England\u2019s University of Birmingham.",
      "Though the far right has been making gains for the past decade, Cheeseman believes the polls showing the far right leading Europe\u2019s top three economies is \u201ca first \u2014 at least in modern times.\u201d",
      "There is no guarantee that London, Berlin and Paris will be ruled by far-right parties; these countries\u2019 next elections are not until 2029, 2029 and 2027 respectively. These groups are all polling in the 20s and 30s percentage-wise, enough to lead polls in Europe\u2019s multiparty systems but not enough to govern alone outside of a coalition.",
      "Most of Europe\u2019s politicians on this former fringe reject the \u201cfar right\u201d label, with its historical connotations of the Nazism that marauded the continent 80 years ago. Many scholars say these parties nevertheless fit the academic model, defined by nativism \u2014 the idea that perceived \u201cnon-native\u201d groups threaten their social fabric \u2014 and harsh punishments for criminality.",
      "The roots of the far-right surge lie in the world financial crisis of 2008, which prompted government to cut budgets for public services and lowered living standards, some experts say, compounded by the Arab Spring of 2011 that birthed civil war in Syria and a mass refugee crisis in Europe four years later.",
      "More recent societal stressors such as the coronavirus pandemic and war in Ukraine have further increased the allure of populism, according to Hans-Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit international group. But populist parties in Europe have also harnessed social media more powerfully than their more centrist opponents, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are masters of using social media much better than any of the more established parties,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have easy solutions to complex problems\u201d \u2014 as he says populist parties do \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s easier to communicate than complex political issues that the actual parties, who do politics rather than just doing populism, will have to deal with.\u201d"

      "U.N.-backed investigators say they have found significant evidence of \u201csystematic torture\u201d at Myanmar detention centers, where the military government is holding children as young as 2 years old as proxies for their parents.",
      "The Southeast Asian nation of about 54 million people has been mired in turmoil since 2021, when democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi was overthrown by the military. The coup set off mass protests across the country that were violently suppressed, followed by a nationwide armed resistance movement that has displaced millions of people.",
      "Investigators said Tuesday there was evidence of \u201ca continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities\u201d across Myanmar, with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by government security forces and affiliated militias as well as armed opposition groups.",
      "That includes an increase in crimes committed against those in detention, many of whom are being held without due process, said Nicholas Koumjian, head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve documented torture against those in detention, including beatings and electric shocks, strangulations, pulling out fingernails, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,\u201d he told reporters in Geneva as his team released its annual report.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had seen evidence that children as young as 2 years old were being detained, often in place of their parents if they are accused of being associated with the opposition and cannot be found.",
      "\u201cSome of the detained children have been subjected to torture, ill-treatment or sexual and gender-based crimes,\u201d the report says.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s military government has detained about 30,000 people in the past four years, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group that tracks arrests in the country.",
      "The Myanmar military could not be reached for comment. It has denied any atrocities are taking place and blamed \u201cterrorists\u201d for unrest.",
      "The 16-page report, which covers a one-year period up to June 30, draws on more than 1,300 sources, including nearly 600 eyewitness testimonies, photographs, videos, documents, maps and forensic evidence.",
      "Koumjian said the Myanmar military appeared to be increasing its use of airstrikes as it loses control of more territory. They continued even after a devastating earthquake in March, he said, often against \u201cblatantly civilian targets\u201d such as schools, hospitals and places of worship.",
      "\u201cOften there\u2019s no military target that we can identify anywhere in the area that could have been the intent of the airstrike,\u201d he said.",
      "Koumjian said investigators were working to determine how the airstrikes were ordered, who was in the chain of command and who flew the planes.",
      "In addition, he said, there is growing evidence of crimes committed by opposition forces, including summary executions of captured fighters from other armed groups.",
      "The team is also still investigating the 2017 Rohingya refugee crisis, during which more than 700,000 people from the mostly Muslim ethnic minority fled a military crackdown in Buddhist-majority Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh. Along with other ethnic groups, the remaining Rohingya population is again in danger as they are persecuted by the Arakan Army rebel group that now has effective control of Rakhine state, their ancestral home.",
      "Koumjian said investigators had made progress in identifying some of the people responsible for crimes in Myanmar, including commanders overseeing detention facilities, and that \u201cwe stand ready to support any jurisdictions willing and able to prosecute these crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law,\u201d he said in a news release.",
      "The work of Myanmar investigators is already being used in cases before the International Criminal Court (ICC), the International Court of Justice and in Argentina. In November, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar\u2019s military government, for crimes committed against the Rohingya.",
      "Min Aung Hlaing tightened his grip on power last month in an administrative restructuring as the junta said it was ending the state of emergency it declared in 2021. A general election is planned for December but faces a widespread boycott by critics who say it will be neither free nor fair."
