      "NEW YORK -- Ten emerging writers, from an author of speculative fiction to a poet rooted in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, have received $50,000 grants from the Whiting Foundation.",
      "Since 1985, the foundation has had a mission to nurture \u201cnew creations\u201d by supporting poets, playwrights and authors of fiction and nonfiction. Past winners have included Tony Kushner, Andr\u00e9 Aciman and Tracy K. Smith.",
      "This week, the foundation announced its class of 2025. Elwin Cofman writes speculative fiction that Whiting judges say offers \u201cilluminating sites of bawdy humor and horror,\u201d while Karisma Price crafts post-Katrina poems that are \u201csongs, howls, portraits, critiques.\u201d Judges praised the essays of Aisha Sabatini Sloan for their \u201cstartling connections between the personal and the collective.\u201d",
      "The other winners were dramatist Liza Birkenmeier, fiction writers Samuel K\u1ecd\u0301l\u00e1w\u1ecdl\u00e9, Shubha Sunder and Claire Luchette, graphic fiction writer Emil Ferris, poet Annie Wenstrup and nonfiction writer Sofi Thanhauser.",
      "\u201cThese writers demonstrate astounding range; each has invented the tools they needed to carve out their narratives and worlds,\u201d Courtney Hodell, Whiting\u2019s director of literary programs, said in a statement. \u201cTaken as a whole, their work shows a sharply honed sensitivity to our history, both individual and collective, and a passionate curiosity as to where a deeper understanding of that history can take us.\u201d",

      "Before she kicks off her upcoming world tour, Katy Perry is reaching for the stars",
      "ONTARIO, Calif. -- After a long day of rehearsing for her upcoming world tour, Katy Perry decided to peruse a few books to help her unwind before bed.",
      "\u201cI was listening to \u2018Cosmos\u2019 by Carl Sagan and reading a book on string theory,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in astrophysics and interested in astronomy and astrology and the stars. We are all made of stardust and we all come from the stars.\u201d",
      "But the pop superstar was motivated by more than just curiosity. On Monday, she will join Jeff Bezos\u2019 fiancee Lauren Sanchez, journalist Gayle King and three other women on an all-female Blue Origin spaceflight. Perry spoke with The Associated Press at her Southern California rehearsal space on Wednesday, days before she was set to leave for training in Texas.",
      "\u201cI am talking to myself every day and going, \u2018You\u2019re brave, you\u2019re bold, you are doing this for the next generation to inspire so many different people but especially young girls to go, \u201cI\u2019ll go to space in the future.\u201d No limitations,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Perry said she has been \u201cpsychologically\u201d preparing for the spaceflight by reading work from the late Sagan and other scientists.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really excited about the engineering of it all. I\u2019m excited to learn more about STEM and just the math about what it takes to accomplish this type of thing,\u201d she said.",
      "An all-female spaceflight seems an apt endeavor for the 40-year-old Perry, whose collection of hits include songs about extraterrestrials (\u201cE.T.\u201d) and fireworks shooting across the sky (\u201cFirework\u201d), as well as feminist anthems like her 2013 hit, \u201cRoar,\u201d and \u201cWOMAN\u2019S WORLD,\u201d off her most recent album.",
      "Perry said that whenever she is doing something new or daunting, she looks inward for strength and confidence.",
      "\u201cUsing that feminine divine that I was born with and definitely unlocked when I had my daughter even more. It leveled up for sure. Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,\u201d she said. Her daughter, Daisy, 4, joined Perry before her rehearsal.",
      "Bezos\u2019 rocket company Blue Origin announced the crew in February. Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV journalist, picked the women who will join her on a 10-minute spaceflight from West Texas aboard a New Shepard rocket. Perry, Sanchez and King will be joined by Aisha Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist who now heads an engineering firm, research scientist Amanda Nguyen and movie producer Kerianne Flynn.",
      "\u201cI am feeling so grateful and grounded and honored to be invited and included with this incredible group of women,\u201d Perry said. Whenever she gets nervous about the trip, she reminds herself how important it is.",
      "Blue Origin has flown tourists on short hops to space since 2021, after Bezos climbed aboard with his brother for the inaugural trip; the upcoming trip will be the company's 11th human spaceflight. Some passengers have received free rides, while others have paid a hefty sum to experience weightlessness. The company declined to comment on who is footing the bill for Monday's flight.",
      "The news of the upcoming trip has not been without critiques, most recently from actor Olivia Munn, who bemoaned the mission's cost and publicity. But Perry believes an all-women crew \u2014 the first since Valentina Tereshkova\u2019s solo spaceflight in 1963 \u2014 has historic ramifications.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an important moment for the future of commercial space travel and for humanity in general and for women all around,\u201d she said, citing the fact that only about 11% of the people who have gone to space have been women. \u201cI\u2019m excited for that number to be even more equal after this flight. And I just feel like, \u2018Put us in coach.\u2019\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Jillian Lauren, author and wife of Weezer bassist Scott Shriner, was shot and injured by Los Angeles police and arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after pointing a gun at officers from her front yard, authorities said Wednesday.",
      "The 51-year-old Lauren, identified by police as Jillian Shriner and listed as Jillian Lauren Shriner in jail records, had injuries that were not life threatening after the shooting in the northeast Los Angeles neighborhood of Eagle Rock on Thursday, the LAPD said in a statement.",
      "Her representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment and there is no indication Scott Shriner was involved in the incident. Weezer is scheduled to play the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on Saturday.",
      "Police said they were assisting California Highway Patrol officers in their search for three suspects from a misdemeanor hit-and-run. Lauren was not among the suspects. But while pursuing one of them who had reportedly been running through a backyard, police came upon Lauren in the front yard of her neighboring residence, holding a handgun.",
      "They ordered her several times to drop the gun, but she refused, and pointed it at them, police allege. They did not say whether she fired the gun, but said she was hit by police gunfire and fled into her home, where they took her into custody then took her to a hospital.",
      "A 9-millimeter handgun was recovered from Shriner\u2019s home, the police statement said.",
      "She was later booked and was being held on $1 million bail, LA County jail records showed.",
      "Lauren has not made a court appearance, and it was not immediately clear whether she has hired a lawyer. There were no immediate responses to an email to her manager and a message left on her author website. There was also no response to an email seeking comment from a representative for Weezer.",
      "Lauren is the author of two bestselling memoirs, 2010's \u201cSome Girls: My Life in a Harem\u201d and 2015's \u201cEverything You Ever Wanted.\u201d",

      "Lawyers for 40 women who accused writer and director James Toback of sexual abuse over a 35-year span say they have been awarded $1.68 billion from a New York jury",
      "A New York jury on Wednesday awarded $1.68 billion in damages to 40 women who accused writer and director James Toback of sexual abuse and other crimes over a span of 35 years, according to lawyers representing the plaintiffs.",
      "The decision stems from a lawsuit filed in Manhattan in 2022 after New York state instituted a one-year window for people to file lawsuits over sexual assault claims even if they took place decades ago.",
      "It marks one of the largest jury awards since the advent of the #MeToo movement, as well as in New York state history, said attorney Brad Beckworth, of the law firm Nix Patterson LLP, in an interview. The plaintiffs, he said, believe such a large verdict will send a message to powerful individuals \u201cwho don't treat women appropriately.\u201d",
      "The court had not yet released documentation of the verdict as of Wednesday night. Beckworth said the verdict included $280 million in compensatory damages and $1.4 billion for punitive damages to the plaintiffs.",
      "\u201cThis verdict is about justice,\u201d Beckworth said in a statement. \u201cBut more importantly, It\u2019s about taking power back from the abusers \u2014 and their and enablers \u2014 and returning it to those he tried to control and silence.\u201d",
      "Beckworth said the abuse took place between 1979 and 2014.",
      "Toback was nominated for an Oscar for writing 1991\u2032s \u201cBugsy,\u201d and his career in Hollywood has spanned more than 40 years. Accusations that he engaged in years of sexual abuse surfaced in late 2017 as the #MeToo movement gained attention. They were first reported by the Los Angeles Times.",
      "In 2018, Los Angeles prosecutors said the statutes of limitations had expired in five cases they reviewed, and declined to bring criminal charges against Toback.",
      "The plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit in New York a few days after the state's Adult Survivors Act went into effect. The lawyers said they discovered a pattern of Toback attempting to lure young women on the streets of New York into meeting him by falsely promising roles in his films and then subjecting them to sexual acts, threats and psychological coercion.",
      "Mary Monahan, a lead plaintiff in the case, called the jury award \u201cvalidation\u201d for her and the other women.",
      "\u201cFor decades, I carried this trauma in silence, and today, a jury believed me. Believed us. That changes everything,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis verdict is more than a number \u2014 it\u2019s a declaration. We are not disposable. We are not liars. We are not collateral damage in someone else\u2019s power trip. The world knows now what we\u2019ve always known: what he did was real.\u201d",
      "Toback, 80, who most recently had represented himself, denied numerous times in court documents that he \u201ccommitted any sexual offense\u201d and that \u201cany sexual encounter or contact between Plaintiffs and Defendant was consensual.\u201d",
      "He also argued that New York's law extending the statute of limitations on sexual abuse cases violated his constitutional rights.",
      "A message sent to an email address listed for him seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "In January, the judge in the case entered a default judgment against Toback, who had failed to appear in court when ordered to do so. The judge then scheduled a trial for only damages last month to determine how much Toback had to pay the women.",

      "Smart phones have largely been a bit of a buzzkill for horror films, leading filmmakers to find all kinds of reasons \u2014 dead batteries, no service \u2014 to strand potential prey. But at least since 1949\u2019s \u201cSorry, Wrong Number,\u201d phones have also been a reliable conduit for terror capable of reaching into the home, or your pocket. \u201cDrop,\u201d a silly but suspenseful new thriller, carries on the tradition of \u201cWhen a Stranger Calls\" and \u201cPhone Booth\u201d by situating its tension around mysterious, threatening phone messages.",
      "Violet ( Meghann Fahy ), a widow with a young child, is on her first date in years. After three months of texting, she has hesitantly agreed to finally meet Henry (Brandon Sklenar) for dinner. When they sit down in a fancy restaurant high up a sleek Chicago high-rise, he\u2019s charming and relaxed. But Violet, like countless dates before her, can\u2019t stay off her phone.",
      "In Violet\u2019s case, though, the distraction is legitimate. She keeps getting messages dropped to her phone threatening her son, who\u2019s at home with Violet\u2019s sister (Violett Beane), unless she does what he says, including killing her date. In her home security cameras she can see a man with his face covered brandishing a gun.",
      "\u201cDrop,\u201d directed by Christopher Landon (\u201cHappy Death Day\u201d), doesn\u2019t differ greatly from the large swath of high-concept, low-budget thrillers that regularly flood theaters. But it\u2019s a taut little movie, almost totally set in the restaurant, with a just keen enough sense of plausible and preposterous. It knows to keep the pressure-cooker plot moving while not overstaying its welcome. At a nifty 95 minutes, \u201cDrop\u201d knows when to hang up.",
      "As if adding a digital twist to the old line \u201cThe call is coming from inside the house,\u201d Violet is getting message from an app called DigiDrop that can only be sent from a person within 50 feet. That means everyone in the restaurant \u2014 the bro who bumps into her, the cheesy waiter, the kind bartender \u2014 is a suspect. With her terrorizer watching her every move and prohibiting her from breathing a word to anyone, Violet is stuck rooted to her table when every fiber of her being wants to rescue her son.",
      "A considerable help to the film are the grounded screen presences of Fahy (\u201cThe White Lotus\u201d) and Sklenar (\u201c1923\u201d), both small-screen breakouts who here show movie-star poise. As the plot unspools, there are, naturally, quibbles one could make. Would a mother, with a masked gunman outside her toddler\u2019s door be able to feign interest in a duck salad? Does the highly orchestrated trap laid for her match the motives of the criminal mastermind? And while we're asking questions, could we not someday get a phone-themed thriller titled \u201cButt Dial\u201d?",
      "But if \u201cDrop\u201d is invariably quite a bit less than realistic, it has a whiff of metaphor. Violet isn\u2019t just stepping back into the dating pool as a single mom, she\u2019s trying to shake the past trauma of spousal abuse. Going on a date with Henry, whom she met on an app, is a kind of crap shoot. Will going out with a stranger met online end in love or violence?",
      "You could also read \u201cDrop\u201d as an extreme version of a more ubiquitous scourge. This is a movie where the bad guy, for nearly the duration of the movie, is nothing but text messages. (They are typically flashed large across the screen.) As Violet grows increasingly preoccupied and frantic, she could be just about anyone \u2014 a workaholic after hours, a teenager, a desperate Knicks fan watching the score \u2014 whose attention is held prisoner by her phone. How much of the terror of \u201cDrop\u201d would have existed at all, if she had just put it on silent?",
      "\"Drop,\u201d a Universal Pictures release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for strong violent content, suicide, some strong language and sexual references. Running time: 95 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "This year, the theme \u2014 \u201cTailored For You\" \u2014 is focused on classic tailoring. As always, the dress code is inspired by the spring exhibit at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d is the first Met show to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years to have a menswear theme. The show looks at the evolution of Black style over the centuries through the lens of dandyism.",

      "The gala happens the first Monday in May \u2014 this year, May 5.",
      "Not everyone knows that the gala is actually a fundraiser for the Costume Institute, the only self-funding department at the Met. Last year the evening brought in a whopping sum of more than $26 million to the museum's coffers.",
      "Definitely not. It started in 1948 as a Manhattan society midnight supper \u2013 held at various places like the Waldorf Astoria and the Rainbow Room. It took many years before it turned into a global event and one of the starriest nights of the year.",
      "Each year brings a new group of celebrity co-chairs. This year they are Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, and A$AP Rocky \u2014 along with Anna Wintour, the influential Vogue editor who always oversees the proceedings. NBA superstar LeBron James is honorary chair.",
      "Word on attendees trickles out slowly in the weeks leading up to the event. But this year there\u2019s also a huge additional host committee with stars from various fields. (They don\u2019t have specific host duties, other than showing up and, it goes without saying, looking fabulous.)",
      "It includes athletes Simone Biles and husband Jonathan Owens, Angel Reese and Sha\u2019Carri Richardson; filmmakers Spike Lee, Tonya Lewis Lee and Regina King; and actors Ayo Edebiri, Audra McDonald and Jeremy Pope, and musicians Doechii, Usher, Tyla, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Andr\u00e9 3000.",
      "Also in the group are author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; artists Jordan Casteel, Rashid Johnson and Kara Walker; playwrights Jeremy O. Harris and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins; and fashion figures Grace Wales Bonner, Edward Enninful, Dapper Dan and Olivier Rousteing.",
      "The code is meant to be a guide, not a hard rule, and loose interpretation is encouraged. Sometimes, that interpretation extends not only to what guests put on, but what they take off. Lady Gaga did a 16-minute striptease on the gala carpet in 2019. Jared Leto spent the evening in 2023 carrying around his huge cat head, a tribute to Karl Lagerfeld's beloved pet.",
      "Guests enter the museum and walk past an enormous flower arrangement in the museum\u2019s grand lobby \u2013 always a talking point. Often there is an an orchestra playing nearby. At the top of the grand staircase, Wintour and her co-hosts form a receiving line. Guests then head either to cocktails or to view the exhibit. Cocktails are followed by dinner. The most hotly anticipated guests sometimes skip cocktails and even dinner, and arrive around dessert time for maximum impact (we're looking at you, Rihanna).",

      "Nelsy Cruz, the governor of Monte Cristi province and sister of seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz, was the first person to alert Dominican President Luis Abinader about the disaster. She called him and said she was buried under the debris, according to first lady Raquel Abraje.",
      "Nelsy Cruz later died at the hospital from her injuries, officials said.",
      "Authorities say it\u2019s too early to determine why the roof fell. Firefighters removed blocks of broken concrete and created makeshift planks to try and reach survivors buried under the debris.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how often government officials inspect buildings in the Dominican Republic and when the last inspection was done at Jet Set.",
      "A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Public Works told The Associated Press that all officials were on scene and not available. She referred questions to the mayor\u2019s office.",
      "A spokesperson for the mayor\u2019s office could not be reached for comment.",
      "The owners of Jet Set, who issued a statement saying they were cooperating with authorities, could not be immediately reached for comment.",
      "Relatives of merengue singer Rubby P\u00e9rez, who was performing when the roof collapsed, said earlier that he was rescued. But Juan Manuel M\u00e9ndez, director of the Center of Emergency Operations, said late Tuesday afternoon that information \u201cturned out to be false.\u201d He said rescue crews were still looking for P\u00e9rez.",
      "Meanwhile, the singer\u2019s manager, Enrique Paulino, whose shirt was spattered with blood, said the group\u2019s saxophonist died.",
      "The Professional Baseball League of the Dominican Republic posted on X that former MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel died. Officials had earlier rescued Dotel from the debris and transported him to a hospital. Also killed was Dominican baseball player Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera, said Satosky Terrero, league spokesman.",
      "It\u2019s an iconic nightclub in southern Santo Domingo that has operated for nearly five decades. It was known for its \u201cJet Set Mondays\u201d that featured local and international artists.",
      "The club opened in 1973 as a club and restaurant, becoming the most popular venue of its kind in the Dominican Republic, according to List\u00edn Diario, a local newspaper.",
      "It later moved from the place where it originally opened, celebrating its first anniversary with merengue and salsa icon Johnny Ventura.",
      "The club underwent renovations in 2010 and 2015, and it was struck by lightning in 2023, according to the newspaper.",
      "General admission tickets for Monday\u2019s concert with Rubby P\u00e9rez were $32, while the VIP ones were $40, according to the club\u2019s website.",
      "Rescue crews were to continue looking for survivors through the night.",
      "While an in-depth investigation into the collapse is expected, authorities have not yet commented on what might have caused the roof to fall, including any potential preliminary findings.",
      "Prosecutor Rosalba Ramos told TV station CDN that while \u201ceveryone wants to know\u201d what happened, authorities were still focused on finding survivors.",

      "Clem Burke, whose versatile drumming propelled the iconic rock group Blondie during its decades performing everything from new-wave punk to disco-infused tunes, has died. He was 70.",
      "The band said in a statement on its website Monday that he died from cancer but no additional details were provided.",
      "\u201cClem was not just a drummer; he was the heartbeat of Blondie,\u201d the band said in a statement. \u201cHis talent, energy, and passion for music were unmatched, and his contributions to our sound and success are immeasurable.\u201d",
      "The self-proclaimed \u201crock & roll survivalist\u201d started playing the drums when he was 14 in his school orchestra but was kicked out for playing too loud, according to Blondie\u2019s website. In the 1970\u2019s, he answered a band's ad in the Village Voice seeking a \u201cfreak energy\u201d rock drummer, kicking off his decades-long career with lead singer Debbie Harry and the rest of his Blondie bandmates.",
      "The band recorded its first album in 1976 and by the following year was touring with such icons as Iggy Pop and David Bowie. It became known as the most commercially successful band to emerge from a fertile New York rock scene that also produced Talking Heads and the Ramones.",
      "In 2006 Burke and the other original members of Blondie were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame after selling more than 42 million records, according to Blondie's website.",
      "During the late 1970s and early \u201980s, the band had eight Top 40 hits, including four No. 1s: \u201cHeart of Glass,\u201d \u201cCall Me,\u201d \u201cThe Tide Is High\u201d and \u201cRapture,\u201d which is regarded as the first No. 1 hit to feature rap. There\u2019s also a five-track 1975 album demo that includes \u201cPlatinum Blonde,\u201d a sort of band mission statement. But Burke\u2019s mark was especially solidified with his rapid, powerful drumming at the start of \u201cDreaming\u201d in 1979.",
      "In 2022, after unearthing a New Wave treasure trove of reel-to-reel tapes, cassettes and records, the band created the box set \u201cBlondie: Against the Odds, 1974-1982,\u201d with 124 tracks and 36 previously unissued recordings, demos, outtakes and remixed versions of Blondie\u2019s initial six studio albums.",
      "Burke reflected on the discovery in an Associated Press article: \u201cWe never would have thought that we would still be here today. Looking back at our archives, it\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d",
      "The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame described Burke in a post Monday on the social platform X as \u201ca versatile and distinctive drummer who played exactly what each song required \u2013 and, when called for, let loose with blistering punk rock energy.\u201d",

      "LAS VEGAS -- The sex abuse trial of former \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d actor Nathan Chasing Horse in Nevada has again been postponed.",
      "A judge on Monday moved the start of the trial in state court in Las Vegas to Aug. 4. The 48-year-old had been scheduled to stand trial next week on charges that he sexually abused Indigenous women and girls for years in the Las Vegas area.",
      "Craig Mueller, Chasing Horse's lawyer, said in a motion filed Friday that he needs more time to prepare and interview witnesses. It's the latest in a series of delays since Chasing Horse was arrested and indicted in early 2023.",
      "Chasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 felonies, including sexual assault of a minor under 16, kidnapping and producing and possessing videos of child sexual abuse. If convicted of the sexual assault charges, he could face decades or life in prison.",
      "After starring as Smiles A Lot in the 1990 Oscar-winning film \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d Chasing Horse began promoting himself as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies, authorities have said. He was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.",
      "Prosecutors say Chasing Horse used his position to gain access to vulnerable women and girls for decades until his arrest near Las Vegas. He has been jailed ever since, but criminal proceedings were at a standstill for more than a year while Chasing Horse challenged his original indictment.",
      "It was eventually dismissed after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors had abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony. The high court's order, however, left open the possibility for charges to be refiled, and prosecutors quickly took their case before another grand jury.",
      "Chasing Horse was again indicted in October. The indictment added new allegations that he filmed himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14. Prosecutors have said the footage, taken in 2010 or 2011, was found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos.",
      "His case has been unfolding at the same time lawmakers and prosecutors around the U.S. are funneling more resources into cases involving Native women, including human trafficking and killings.",

The comic had been scheduled as a featured speaker April 26 at the White House Correspondents Association' s annual dinner. But the WHCA rescinded the offer to Ruffin, a blunt critic of President Donald Trump, saying it wanted to focus on journalistic achievement.",
      "In a statement Monday, PEN co-interim CEO Clarisse Rosaz Shariyf praised Ruffin for her \u201cbrilliant social commentary, her satire and exceptional talent.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe is truly emblematic of the talented creators who we need on stages and in writers\u2019 rooms during a time of unprecedented censorship in this country. We\u2019re both delighted and honored to have her with us,\" Shariyf added.",

      "Ruffin, whose credits include writing for NBC\u2019s Seth Meyers, last year's host for the PEN gala, has said she was cut from the WCHA event after telling organizers that she had no intentions of being evenhanded. During a Daily Beast podcast last month, Ruffin said she was told \u201cyou need to be equal and be sure that you give it to both sides and I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to happen.'\"",

      "NEW YORK -- For 11 seasons, Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr. has sat across from his guests on the popular PBS series \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d and led them through secrets in their family tree. On Tuesday, it's his turn.",
      "The Harvard scholar learns a long-buried puzzle about his great-great grandmother, Jane Gates, information which scrambles his ancestry and opens up a new branch that goes back to Ireland.",
      "\u201cI was moved to tears,\u201d Gates tells The Associated Press ahead of the airing. \u201cI used to pass her grave at the Gates' plot in Rose Hill Cemetery and I would say, \u2018Grandma, I\u2019m going to out you. I\u2019m going to tell the world your secret.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d is PBS\u2019s most-watched program on linear TV and the most-streamed non-drama program. Season 10 reached nearly 18 million people across linear and digital platforms and also received its first Emmy nomination.",
      "\u201cThe two subliminal messages of \u2019Finding Your Roots,' which are needed more urgently today than ever, is that what has made America great is that we\u2019re a nation of immigrants,\" says Gates. \u201cAnd secondly, at the level of the genome, despite our apparent physical differences, we\u2019re 99.99% the same.\u201d",
      "Season 11 has featured Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell, Melanie Lynskey, chef Jose Andres, Sharon Stone and Amanda Seyfried, who learned why her paternal third-great-grandfather was murdered.",
      "Gates shares the last episode with Laurence Fishburne, who learns the identity of his biological father. It turns out both men adored jazz, which delighted Dyllan McGee, who helped create and produce \u201cFinding Your Roots.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt underscored how family connections can shape us, even unknowingly, and made me wonder if reconnecting with our past somehow affirms the significance of our own stories by showing us how much each individual on our tree shapes us even when we don\u2019t know it,\u201d she says.",
      "The series started in 2006 under the title \u201cAfrican American Lives,\u201d conceived by Gates in the middle of the night in his bathroom. He invited prominent Black celebrities and traced their family trees into slavery. When the paper trail ran out, they would use DNA to see which ethnic group they were from in Africa.",
      "Challenged by a viewer to open the show to non-Black celebrities, Gates agreed and the series was renamed \u201cFaces of America,\u201d which had to be changed again after the name was taken. Along the way, Gates had a crash course in DNA.",
      "\u201cFor a guy with a PhD in English literature, I think I can do pretty well on the AP genetics exam,\u201d he says, before proving it with a thorough explanation of autosomal DNA.",
      "Over the years, the show has delivered fascinating results, like when Natalie Morales discovered she\u2019s related to one of the legendary pirates of the Caribbean and when former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Andy Samberg found his biological grandmother and grandfather. It revealed that RuPaul and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker are cousins, as are Meryl Streep and Eva Longoria.",
      "Guests have included former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, designer Diane von Furstenberg and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d author George R. R. Martin.",
      "\u201cI always tell my guests that you\u2019re not responsible for the crazy things your ancestors did. I don\u2019t care what they did. Guilt is not inheritable,\u201d Gates says. \u201cYou have to understand how the people functioned in the past without judging them.\u201d",
      "He and his team \u2014 particularly genetic genealogist CeCe Moore \u2014 have found that traditional family stories passed down through the generations are often filled with a few lies, often to cover up bad behavior.",
      "\u201cI call it where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire. The stories are never accurate, but they\u2019re often close,\u201d says Gates. \u201cThere is a kernel of truth there.\u201d",
      "It took researchers four years to resolve the mystery of who was Gates' great-great grandfather, the man who impregnated Jane Gates. The story she told about her children's father turned out to be not correct.",
      "The researchers show him an 1888 obituary for her and a 1839 ad for her sale. Gates comments that he\u2019s seen a thousand bill of sales like it, but this hit differently. At the end, he looks again at a photo of Jane Gates. \u201cI see a lot of pain in those eyes and now I know why.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomething changed for him that day,\" says McGee. \"I remember him calling me after the reveal saying, 'That was the best day of my life!' It was such a treat for the entire team to be able to give him the gift of a missing link in his family history that he has given hundreds of our guests.\u201d",
      "Gates is a huge advocate that everyone should have their family tree traced and pushes back against the idea that digging up the past is divisive.",
      "\u201cI believe that knowing about our ancestors is fundamental to knowing about ourselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only way to deal with the past is to know about the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn terms of people who would pretend that the past is irrelevant and we need to look forward, William Faulkner wrote, \u2018The past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past,\u2019\u201d Gates adds. \u201cIt\u2019s still with us, shaping both who we are and the society and our norms under which we function.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Removing books from library shelves is no longer just a story of objections from a local community or an individual parent, the American Library Association says.",
      "In its new State of American Libraries Report released Monday, the ALA found more than 70% of attempted bans of a given title or titles come from organized groups and elected officials, and just 16% originated with a parent.",
      "The most commonly criticized books, including Maia Kobabe\u2019s \u201cGender Queer\u201d and the late Toni Morrison's \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d can be found on such websites as www.ratedbooks.org and through lists compiled by Moms for Liberty and other conservative activists.",
      "\u201cWe can trace many of the challenges to lists of books that have been distributed by Moms for Liberty and other groups,\" said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, who directs the association's Office for Intellectual Freedom.",
      "As part of its annual report, the ALA unveiled its list of the 10 most \u201cchallenged books\u201d of 2024, starting with George M. Johnson's \u201cAll Boys Aren't Blue,\u201d and also featuring \u201cGender Queer,\u201d \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d Stephen Chbosky's \u201cThe Perks of Being a Wallflower\u201d and John Green's \u201cLooking for Alaska.\u201d",

      "The ALA defines a challenge as a \u201cformal, written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that materials be removed because of content or appropriateness.\u201d The association, which compiles censorship data through media accounts and reports from librarians, has long believed the actual number of challenges is far higher than the numbers cited in its annual studies.",
      "The report comes at an especially perilous time for libraries. The Trump administration is implementing drastic cuts at the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which already is canceling grants to state libraries.",
      "Bans have surged in recent years and several states, from Texas and Florida to Iowa and Utah, have passed laws restricting what school libraries can acquire. While the ALA is reporting a sharp drop in challenges in 2024, down to 821 attempts compared to 1,247 the year before, the number remains far higher than before 2021.",
      "And Caldwell-Stone doesn't believe censorship is declining. Libraries are now more likely to avoid stocking books that are controversial, or may be prohibited by law, she says.",
      "\u201cI spoke to a librarian from Texas who told me she was looking over a political book and wasn't sure if she could add it to the collection,\u201d Caldwell-Stone said. \u201cLibrarians don't want to get prosecuted or otherwise face legal trouble.

      "Regional Mexican music is crossing borders and going global",
      "MEXICO CITY -- At a Mexican military base, Captain Eduardo Barr\u00f3n picks up not a rifle but a microphone. Swaying boot-to-boot, he belts out a song as the sounds of trumpets and accordions roar from a band of a dozen camouflage-clad soldiers.",
      "The rhythmic style \u2014 known as a corrido \u2014 is recognizable to just about every soul in the Latin American nation of 130 million. But Barr\u00f3n\u2019s lyrics diverge sharply from those blaring on speakers across Mexico.",
      "\u201cI still remember the day I joined the military,\u201d he crooned. \u201cThis is a dream my soul longed for, and if I were to live another life, I\u2019d become a soldier again.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n, who performs under the name \u201cEddy Barr\u00f3n,\" began releasing music videos and songs on Spotify last year in coordination with the Mexican military. His lyrics extol the army\u2019s virtues, celebrate proud parents and honor the fallen.",
      "They stand in stark contrast to the controversial narco corridos, a subgenre that has sparked controversy as famed artists pay homage to cartel bosses, portraying them as rebels going against the system.",
      "Faced with the challenge of addressing a musical style that depicts cartel violence, local governments across Mexico have increasingly banned performances and pursued criminal investigations of bands and musicians. Mexico\u2019s president even vowed to reduce the popularity of narco corridos while promoting other, less violent musical styles.",
      "But Barr\u00f3n, 33, is taking a different approach. Instead of censorship, he wants to build upon the momentum with his own military corridos, an effort to both infuse the genre with more socially acceptable lyrics and recruit young people to the military.",
      "\u201cNarco life is in style and they make it sound really pretty \u2026 but the reality is different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing our part to invite young people to join this movement of positive music.\u201d",
      "Barron's military ballads are part of a wider government push spearheaded by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has proposed that the government promote corridos about \u201clove, falling out of love and peace.\u201d",
      "She even announced a government-sponsored Mexican music competition in the northern state of Durango showcasing music that avoids \u201cglorifying violence, drugs and discrimination against women.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will completely change Mexican music,\u201d she said.",
      "But in a subculture long defined by resistance and putting words to the harsh realities facing the poor, the government's initiatives around the genre have been met with skepticism about official attempts to promote family-friendly narratives.",
      "\u201cI don't think using corridos as a way to incorporate other kinds of narratives, is a bad idea,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Valenzuela, a Tijuana sociologist who studies the genre. \u201cThere are a lot of songs that sing of peace and love. It\u2019s just that those aren\u2019t the ones that are turning out to be hits \u2026 because we\u2019re living in a moment of aggrieved youth.\u201d",
      "Corridos were born in the 19th century, their classical band instruments and the accordion rooted in German and Polish migration to Mexico. At a time of widespread illiteracy, they were used widely to pass on oral histories.",
      "The ballads took off during the Mexican revolution, when they were used to share stories of war heroes and glory from the conflict.",
      "That is why Barr\u00f3n says he didn\u2019t invent military corridos, but that he\u2019s simply bringing them back.",
      "\u201cCorridos come from the revolution, and we\u2019re doing the same thing as those soldiers and revolutionaries, albeit in a different age, but the result is the same,\u201d he said.",
      "The genre evolved over generations, from singing about smuggling tequila during the 1920\u2019s Prohibition era in corridos tequileros to grappling with the rising wave of cartel violence in Mexico with narco corridos.",
      "\u201cAll the big social issues are told through corridos,\u201d Valenzuela said. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor to speak about what we\u2019ve been living through.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n said he would play guitar with his father\u2019s Mexican regional music band as a teenager, and write his own music. He would bring his guitar to play on deployments after he joined the army at 20.",
      "In 2021, he said he began writing his own songs about his time in the military and singing with a military FX Band, named after the type of gun the military uses. But the music never went public.",
      "Around 2023, the genre exploded when artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano began to mix the classic style with trap music in what are known as corridos tumbados. That same year, Peso Pluma bested Taylor Swift as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "A year later, the Mexican army decided to post Barr\u00f3n's music under his artistic name.",
      "The music videos, which have clocked tens of thousands of views on YouTube alone, are layered with images of heavy duty weapons, the Mexican flag, barbed wire and Barr\u00f3n belting out in camouflage and infrared goggles pulled above his military helmet.",
      "Originally intended to entertain troops and boost military recruitment among young Mexicans, Barr\u00f3n's songs took on a different meaning amidst the renewed controversy that has come with the corridos boom.",
      "The musical style has long been criticized for romanticizing cartel violence, but has hit an inflection point in recent years.",
      "Mexican states have implemented performance bans, and prominent artists have received death threats, often claiming to be from rival cartels whose leaders are glorified in their music. And musicians have been forced to cancel shows due to concerns about potential violence.",
      "The controversy intensified last week, after the face of top cartel boss Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \u201cEl Mencho\u201d Oseguera was projected onto a large screen behind the band Los Alegres del Barranco at a music festival in the northern state of Jalisco. The incident, occurring shortly after Oseguera\u2019s cartel was linked to a ranch under investigation as a training camp and body disposal site in Jalisco, sent shockwaves across Mexico.",
      "The performance was met with a cascade of criticisms. Two Mexican states announced criminal investigations, concerts were cancelled and the Trump administration revoked the U.S. visas of band members.",
      "It also marked a hardening in tone by Sheinbaum, who called for an investigation into the concert, adding: \u201cYou can\u2019t justify violence or criminal groups.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n, who opposes a ban on corridos, believes the solution is to continue to sing cloaked in camouflage with the hopes of reclaiming the Mexican music from his childhood from the negative stereotypes that have grown to define it.",
      "He said the army is already planning to release new songs in the coming months.",
      "\"Sadly, we've been stuck with this label of corridos as negative music,\" he said. \u201cA better approach is to reclaim the genre and take a different path to shift the conversation.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A key program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle chronic disease in Native American and Alaska Native communities has been gutted in the federal health layoffs",
      "CHANDLER, Ariz. -- CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spent time in tribal communities in Arizona and New Mexico this week highlighting ways they are trying to prevent chronic disease among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, something he has said is one of his top priorities.",
      "But Kennedy didn't appear to publicly address a Native health program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle disproportionate rates of conditions like diabetes and liver disease. The program, called Healthy Tribes, was gutted in this month's federal health layoffs.",
      "Some Native leaders say they are having trouble grasping the dissonance between Kennedy's words and his actions. With little information, they wonder if Healthy Tribes is part of the Trump administration's push to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. There also is confusion about what and who is left at the 11-year-old program, which was part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under Kennedy's agency, and doled out $32.5 million a year.",
      "Tribal leaders and health officials told The Associated Press that cuts to the Healthy Tribes program are another violation of the federal government\u2019s legal obligation, or trust responsibility, to tribal nations under treaties, law and other acts. That includes funding for health care through the Indian Health Service, as well as education and public safety for citizens of the 574 federally recognized tribes.",
      "But federal funding has long fallen short of meeting those needs, leaving tribal governments to rely on additional grants and programs like Healthy Tribes.",
      "\u201cSo many layers of communications of collaboration and partnerships have just been turned off,\u201d said Onawa Miller, a Quechan Indian Nation citizen and director of tribal public health for United South and Eastern Tribes, which serves 33 tribes in those regions of the U.S. She said her organization already has received its annual $2 million in Healthy Tribes funding.",
      "Several tribal facilities received an email from a CDC employee April 1 notifying them that the positions of many people who staffed the Healthy Tribes program had been eliminated \u201cas part of the reduction in force efforts at CDC.\u201d",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees union, which represents thousands of workers at the CDC in Atlanta, said more than 30 civil servant jobs were or are being eliminated. That includes 11 positions in the Healthy Tribes program and others in the larger Division of Population Health.",
      "An email sent to the account of Healthy Tribes director Dr. Julianna Reece, an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation, was met with an automated reply: \u201cDue to the recent HHS reduction in force, I have been placed on administrative leave and will be separated from the agency on June 2nd.\u201d Reece did not respond to requests for comment sent to her federal and personal email accounts.",
      "Part of the government upheaval in the past several weeks includes top officials at the National Institutes of Health being offered transfers to Indian Health Service offices far from Washington, D.C. The National Indian Health Board also has said the government eliminated key staff and programs at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health\u2019s Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health.",
      "The government is required to consult with tribes on decisions impacting them, like mass layoffs in February at the Indian Health Service that were rescinded hours later, and tribal leaders have warned the Trump administration that such consultations are not happening. In some cases tribes can take legal action against the U.S. for failing to meet its trust responsibilities.",
      "\u201cIt is a violation of trust, without a doubt,\u201d said W. Ron Allen, chairman of the Jamestown S\u2019Klallam Tribe in Washington state.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not answer questions related to the Healthy Tribes cuts but told the AP in an email that the Indian Health Service was not impacted by this month's workforce reductions and there are no plans to consolidate any of its offices.",
      "Kennedy's swing through the Southwest included a visit to a community health center in metro Phoenix that provides physical and mental health care to Native people and a hike with the Navajo Nation president. He also moderated a panel at the Tribal Self-Governance Conference, held on the Gila River Indian Reservation in Arizona, but didn't take questions from the audience, tribal leaders on stage or journalists.",
      "Allen said he had a constructive conversation with Kennedy, reminding him IHS is already underfunded and understaffed and that tribes rely on additional federal grants and programs.",
      "\u201cYour issue is to reduce the central office, and so we\u2019re OK with that, but move the functions that serve the tribes out to the tribes,\u201d Allen said he told Kennedy. \u201cBecause if we don\u2019t have those resources, how are we gonna make our communities healthy? He agrees.\u201d",
      "Research shows Native Americans have shorter life expectancies than other ethnic groups, and the Indian Health Service says they face higher mortality rates from chronic conditions like diabetes and liver disease.",
      "In Seattle, Healthy Tribes money pays for a program called GATHER, which focuses on integrating traditional tribal medicine practices into health care. Providers at the Seattle Indian Health Board can use medicine made from plants grown in a community garden. A traditional Native medicine apprentice or healer is a part of a patient's care team.",
      "Seattle Indian Health Board President Esther Lucero, a descendant of the Navajo Nation, said her staff meets with people from the CDC and other Healthy Tribes grantees bimonthly to discuss project updates and ensure compliance with grants. But after last week's layoffs, they are having trouble contacting anyone.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t actually administer the dollars, how are you going to actually get them out to the programs?\u201d she said. \u201cWith this current administration, it\u2019s almost like every day we receive an unexpected notice, and then we will get a follow-up notice that says ... you need to move forward as usual.\u201d",
      "Lycia Ortega, interim CEO of Los Angeles-based United American Indian Involvement, echoed concerns about the ambiguous and somewhat confusing messages. Her organization uses Healthy Tribes money to foster connections between younger people and elders in Native American and Alaska Native communities.",
      "Native communities have had to push back against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to cut programs that might be considered DEI initiatives, she said, with the help of lawyers, policy experts and watchdogs who point out areas where the government might not be honoring the trust responsibility.",
      "Native people \u201chave a distinct political power,\u201d said Ortega, a citizen of the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, but \u201cthere are policymakers who see tribes as a threat rather than a partner.\u201d",
      "Stephen Roe Lewis, governor of the Gila River Indian Community, said he told Kennedy privately that consulting with and engaging in respectful partnerships with tribes is key to fulfilling the federal government\u2019s trust responsibilities.",
      "Since the Trump administration began making massive cuts to the federal workforce, many tribal leaders have had to clarify with newly appointed federal officials that services to tribes are not based on race but rather on the political status of tribal nations.",
      "\u201cI made it very clear, we are not DEI \u2014 as tribal nations, as a political entity,\" he said.",

And I don\u2019t remember a single one of the 62 Marseillaises (national anthems) I experienced,\u201d Chabal said in an interview with the \u201cLegend\u201d show on YouTube. \u201cI don\u2019t have the memory of past moments.\"",
      "During his career he also won the English title with Sale and scored six tries for France.

      "The 47-year-old became a household name in France and in rugby circles abroad because of his bushy black beard, his hard tackling and the icy stare he gave opponents.",
      "His appearance and his intimidating presence on the rugby field earned him nicknames such as \u201cThe Caveman,\u201d \u201cThe Anesthetist\u201d and \u201cHannibal Lecter.\u201d It also earned him considerable endorsement deals and says he earned annual income up to 800,000 euros (around $900,000).",
      "He was also quick to rebuke media who tried to interview him in English during the 2007 Rugby World Cup, which was held in France.",
      "Even though he spoke very good English from his time with Sale near Manchester from 2004-09, he would issue a blunt retort saying \u201cwe are in France, we speak French.\u201d",
      "Chabal's memory loss is so profound that he says he does not even remember the birth of his daughter and has hazy recollections of his own childhood.",
      "\u201cI don't remember many things. I have two or three childhood memories, but only just,\" he said. \u201dBut I'm not even sure I remember them, because I was told about them.\"",
      "Chabal's international career peaked with a 2007 World Cup semifinal and his 14-year club career ended in 2014 with Lyon.",
      "Although he is now speaking about his concussion, he has not sought medical help.",

      "A woman in Australia unknowingly gave birth to a stranger's baby after an IVF clinic mistakenly transferred the wrong embryo, the clinic said",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A woman in Australia unknowingly gave birth to a stranger\u2019s baby after she received another patient's embryo from her in vitro fertilization clinic due to \u201chuman error,\u201d the clinic said.",
      "The mix-up was discovered in February when the clinic in the city of Brisbane found that the birth parents had one too many embryos in storage, said the provider, Monash IVF, in a statement supplied Friday. Staff discovered an embryo from another patient had been mistakenly thawed and transferred to the birth mother, a spokesperson said.",
      "Australia news outlets reported the baby was born in 2024.",
      "The company, one of Australia\u2019s biggest IVF providers, said an initial investigation had not uncovered any other such errors. Its statement didn\u2019t identify the patients involved or divulge details about the child's custody.",
      "\u201cAll of us at Monash IVF are devastated and we apologise to everyone involved,\u201d said CEO Michael Knaap. \u201cWe will continue to support the patients through this extremely distressing time.\u201d",
      "The \u201chuman error\u201d was made \u201cdespite strict laboratory safety protocols being in place,\u201d the statement said. The company said it had reported the episode to the relevant regulator in the state of Queensland.",
      "Monash IVF opened in 1971 and sees patients in dozens of locations throughout Australia. Last year, the firm settled a class action lawsuit from more than 700 patients, making no admission of liability, after claims its clinics destroyed potentially viable embryos.",
      "The clinic paid a settlement of 56 million Australian dollars ($35 million).",
      "Rare cases of embryo mix-ups have been reported before, including in the United States, Britain, Israel and Europe. A woman in the U.S. state of Georgia in February filed a lawsuit against a fertility clinic after she gave birth to a stranger\u2019s baby.",
      "Krystena Murray realized the error after the baby's birth because she and her sperm donor were both white and the child was Black. Murray said she wanted to raise the baby but voluntarily gave the 5-month-old to his biological parents after she was told she would not win a legal fight for his custody.",
      "In Australia, each state makes its own laws and rules governing the use of IVF, which advocates say puts patients at risk of error or oversight failings. Queensland\u2019s parliament passed its first laws regulating the sector in 2024.",
      "The measures will establish a registry for all people conceived at a clinic and made the destruction of donors\u2019 medical histories illegal. The change followed an official report that lambasted the storage of frozen sperm donations in Queensland, finding nearly half of samples checked were at medium or high risk of misidentification and recommending thousands be destroyed.",
      "Australia\u2019s states and territories \u201cneed to see if their regulations are up to scratch,\u201d the Minister for Social Services Amanda Rishworth told the Today news program Friday.",
      "\u201cConfidence needs to be brought back and it\u2019s imperative that happens.\u201d",

      "Public officials in 16 states and the District of Columbia are suing the Trump administration to restore access to federal pandemic relief funding for schools",
      "Public officials in 16 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration Thursday to restore access to pandemic relief aid for schools, saying the Education Department's abrupt halt of hundreds of millions of dollars of promised funding will force cuts to vital services.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by a coalition of 16 Democratic attorneys general, led by New York\u2019s Letitia James, plus Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, also a Democrat. It claims the administration's refusal to release the aid violates federal law because it reversed a prior decision to allow states to access the money through March 2026.",
      "States were notified late last month that the Education Department would not honor deadline extensions granted by the Biden administration to spend the remainder of COVID relief aid approved by by Congress to help schools and students recover from the lasting impacts of the pandemic. Schools were supposed to spend the last of the relief by January but many sought, and were granted, more time.",
      "In announcing the reversal, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said schools had \u201cample time\u201d to spend the money, but the agency would consider requests for extensions for individual projects. The department did not say how much money is left of the total $189 billion approved.",
      "New York state lost access to $134 million, James' office said in a press release. It said the relief funding has supported repairs and improvements to school buildings and the purchase of library books, playground equipment and wheelchair-accessible buses. Districts also relied on the aid for programs and services for homeless students, as well as tutoring for students who fell behind because of missed classroom time.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s latest attack on our schools will hurt our most vulnerable students and make it harder for them to thrive,\u201d James said. \u201cCutting school systems\u2019 access to vital resources that our students and teachers rely on is outrageous and illegal.\u201d",
      "Joining the lawsuit were the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, and the District of Columbia.",

      "Outdoor enthusiasts are worried about the loss of their favorite vistas as President Donald Trump's administration considers weakening a 26-year-old rule designed to improve visibility over national parks and wilderness areas",
      "During a hike in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1995, Don Barger climbed Chilhowee Mountain hoping to gaze across the valley below. All he saw was a wall of gray haze.",
      "Today, he said, he can see some 50 miles (80 kilometers) across that same valley to the Cumberland Mountains.",
      "A 26-year-old federal regulation known as the regional haze rule has helped cut down on pollution over national parks, wilderness areas and tribal reservations, restoring some of the nation's most spectacular natural vistas for outdoor lovers like Barger. But conservationists fear those gains may be lost after President Donald Trump's administration announced in March the rule is among dozens of landmark environmental regulations that it plans to roll back.",
      "\u201cIt means a promise that was made to the American public is lost,\u201d Barger, 74, said. \u201cMore and more generations of people are going to grow up as ignorant as I was, not realizing what I'm missing and not seeing.\u201d",
      "Haze forms when small particles of air pollution, such as sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides, scatter and absorb sunlight, blurring views and decreasing visibility.",
      "Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1977 to make restoring and maintaining visibility a goal for 156 national parks, wilderness areas, wildlife refuges and tribal reservations across 36 states. That includes places like the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee; Grand Canyon National Park; Glacier National Park; and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.",
      "After years of drafting and litigation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted regulations known as the regional haze rule in 1999 to implement the amendments.",
      "The rule calls for attaining natural visibility conditions by the year 2064 and mandates that states come up with plans that include limitations on emissions, compliance schedules and monitoring strategies. Older facilities that emit pollution, such as coal-fired power plants, must adopt mitigation technology such as scrubbers or shut down periodically to decrease overall annual emissions.",
      "The states' plans have been plagued with delays as the EPA approves parts of them and rejects others. For example, two big oil- and coal-producing states, North Dakota and Wyoming, and industry groups filed petitions in federal court in January seeking review of EPA decisions rejecting their plans, according to the Harvard Law School's Environmental and Energy Law Program.",
      "The rule works in conjunction with other federal antipollution regulations, but it's been crucial in clearing the skies over national parks and wilderness areas.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of data from a nationwide network of monitoring sites from 1999, when the rule was implemented, through 2023 shows 93% of the parks and wilderness areas have seen improved air quality on clear days. No parks or wilderness areas have seen any notable worsening in visibility.",
      "Visibility in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was twice as good on a typical clear day in 2023 as it was in 1999, marking the biggest improvement among the national parks.",
      "The EPA estimates that between 2007 and 2018 the rule has cut 500,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and 300,000 tons of nitrous oxides annually. The average visual range has increased from 90 miles to 120 miles (144 kilometers to 193 kilometers) in some western parks and from 50 to 70 miles (80 kilometers to 112 kilometers) in some eastern parks, according to the Harvard program.",
      "Trump's EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced March 12 that the agency would look to roll back 31 landmark environmental regulations, including the regional haze rule. Zeldin called the announcement the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in American history\u201d and said in an essay published in the Wall Street Journal that the administration is \u201cdriving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment on the regional haze rule, the EPA said they want to better account for pollution from outside the U.S. and from natural sources and avoid unnecessary burdens for states and industry.",
      "In a cost-benefit analysis of the rule before it took effect, the EPA found it would cost energy producers up to $98 billion by 2025 while providing about $344 billion in benefits such as health care savings.",
      "Producers argue that the haze rule has done its job and it doesn't make sense to continue to impose costs on them.",
      "\u201cThis is a matter of diminishing returns,\u201d said Jonathan Fortner, interim president and CEO of the Lignite Energy Council, which advocates for North Dakota's coal industry. \u201cThe air is clean, the data proves it, and the science backs that up. The rule's being misapplied, not because we disagree with clean air goals, but because we're already there.\u201d",
      "Two federal properties in North Dakota are subject to the rule, the Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge and Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The AP analysis found both sites have seen dramatic visibility improvements over the five years from 2019 to 2023.",
      "EPA officials did not respond to an AP request for a list of power plants that have closed due to the regional haze rule. A number of energy industry groups did not return repeated requests for comment, including the U.S. Energy Association and the National Utility Contractors Association.",
      "Advocates of the rule say eliminating it could lead to reduced tourism and the economic boom visitors bring to national park regions. The National Park Service estimates 325 million people visited national parks in 2023, spending $26.4 billion in gateway communities.",
      "Nothing appears likely to change overnight. Conservationists expect the Trump administration to pursue a rollback through language revisions in the rule, a process that would require a public comment period and would likely trigger court challenges that could last years.",
      "\u201cI've watched the Great Smoky Mountains National Park emerge from the chemical haze that once enshrouded it and was getting worse,\u201d Barger said. \u201cIt's just this visceral sense of place. We had lost it entirely. The Clean Air Act is working and it's a work in progress. You have to stay with it or it doesn't work.\u201d",

      "The Food and Drug Administration is reversing course on its requirement for all staffers to report to the office",
      "WASHINGTON -- Weeks after ordering all Food and Drug Administration employees back into the office, the agency is reversing course, allowing some of its most prized staffers to work remotely amid worries that recent layoffs and resignations could jeopardize basic functions, like approving new medicines.",
      "An internal email obtained by The Associated Press states that FDA leadership are \u201callowing review staff and supervisors to resume telework\u201d at least two days a week. The policy shift was confirmed by three FDA staffers who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency matters.",
      "The message was sent Tuesday to some of the FDA\u2019s hundreds of drug reviewers. Staffers said a similar policy was communicated to reviewers who handle vaccines, biotech drugs, medical devices and tobacco products\u2014 although not always in writing.",
      "It\u2019s the latest example of the Trump administration\u2019s chaotic approach to overhauling the federal health workforce, which has included firings, a scramble to rehire some employees, and then additional layoffs last week of an estimated 3,400 staffers, or more than 15% of the agency\u2019s workforce. When FDA employees were called back to the agency's Maryland headquarters last month they confronted overflowing parking lots, crowded offices and broken or missing supplies.",
      "A spokeswoman for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the administration is returning to \u201cpre-COVID telework arrangements for reviewers, whose read and write work output is tracked in 15-minute increments to ensure productivity and accountability.\u201d",
      "While many agencies switched to telework during the pandemic, the FDA began embracing the practice nearly two decades earlier. The flexibility was seen as a competitive perk for recruiting employees who can often earn more working in industry.",
      "Last week's cuts included entire offices focusing on FDA policy and regulations, most of the agency\u2019s communication staff and teams that support food inspectors and investigators. Senior officials overseeing tobacco, new drugs, vaccines and other products have also been dismissed or forced to resign. Staffers have described rank-and-file employees \u201cpouring\u201d out of the agency.",
      "Former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler called the cuts \"devastating, haphazard, thoughtless and chaotic\" during a House hearing on Wednesday.",
      "When Kennedy announced plans to eliminate 10,000 staffers across the federal health workforce, he noted that FDA medical reviewers and safety inspectors wouldn't be impacted.",
      "In February, HHS was forced to recall some probationary employees who were fired, including hundreds of medical reviewers at FDA, whose salaries are largely funded by industry fees, not federal dollars.",
      "But last week\u2019s cuts combined with resignations and retirements have raised a new threat: that FDA funding could fall so low that it short circuits a long-standing system in which companies help fund much of the agency's operations.",
      "Nearly half the FDA's nearly $7 billion budget comes from fees collected from drug, device and tobacco companies. The agency uses the money to hire thousands of extra staffers to quickly and efficiently review new products. For example, about 70% of the FDA\u2019s drug program is financed by user-fee agreements, which must be reauthorized by Congress every five years.",
      "But the agreements stipulate that if FDA\u2019s federal funding falls below set levels, companies are no longer required to pay fees and, in some cases, can claw back their money. The threshold requirements are designed to ensure Congress continues funding FDA, rather than relying entirely on the private sector.",
      "FDA and industry groups are supposed to begin negotiations later this year to renew several user-fee agreements, including those for drugs and devices.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the agency nor regulated industry can afford for \u2018user fees\u2019 not to be reauthorized,\u201d said Michael Gaba, an attorney who advises FDA-regulated companies.",
      "Whatever the reasoning behind the telework shift, former government officials say it\u2019s a sign that recently confirmed FDA Commissioner Marty Makary is trying to retain and rebuild staffing and resources. Makary made his first appearance at FDA's headquarters last Wednesday, one day after the mass layoffs. According to the memo obtained by the AP, Makary signed off on the return to telework.",
      "\u201cDr. Makary needs to rebuild teams and restart the engine of productivity lost to weeks of job insecurity, uncertainty and shortages of team members,\u201d said Steven Grossman, a former HHS official. \u201cTurning commuting time back into work time is a great first step in achieving both.\u201d",

      "A day care facility in a Texas county that's part of the measles outbreak has multiple cases, including children too young to be fully vaccinated, public health officials say.",
      "West Texas is in the middle of a still-growing measles outbreak with 481 cases Friday. The state expanded the number of counties in the outbreak area this week to 10. The highly contagious virus began to spread in late January and health officials say it has spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.",
      "Three people who were unvaccinated have died from measles-related illnesses this year, including two elementary school-aged children in Texas. The second child died Thursday at a Lubbock hospital, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended the funeral in Seminole, the epicenter of the outbreak.",
      "As of Friday, there were seven cases at a day care where one young child who was infectious gave it to two other children before it spread to other classrooms, Lubbock Public Health director Katherine Wells said.",
      "\u201cMeasles is so contagious I won\u2019t be surprised if it enters other facilities,\u201d Wells said.",
      "There are more than 200 children at the day care, Wells said, and most have had least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, which is first recommended between 12 and 15 months old and a second shot between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "\u201cWe do have some children that have only received one dose that are now infected,\u201d she said.",
      "The public health department is recommending that any child with only one vaccine get their second dose early, and changed its recommendation for kids in Lubbock County to get the first vaccine dose at 6 months old instead of 1. A child who is unvaccinated and attends the day care must stay home for 21 days since their last exposure, Wells said.",
      "Case count and hospitalization numbers in Texas have climbed steadily since the outbreak began, and spiked by 81 cases from March 28 to April 4, with 16 more people hospitalized in that time.",

He expected a small team to arrive later this week, followed by a bigger group on the ground next week.",

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention soon to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide. Kennedy also said he\u2019s assembling a task force to focus on the issue.",
      "Also on Monday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing \u201cnew scientific information\" on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.",
      "Kennedy told The Associated Press of his plans after a news conference in Salt Lake City.",
      "Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their water systems. Water systems across the state must shut down their fluoridation systems by May 7.",
      "Kennedy praised Utah for emerging as \u201cthe leader in making America healthy again.\u201d He was flanked by Utah legislative leaders and the sponsor of the state\u2019s fluoride law. \u201cI\u2019m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it, and I hope many more will,\u201d he said.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who appeared with Kennedy at the news conference, said his agency was launching a renewed examination of scientific studies on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water to help inform any changes to the national standards.",
      "\u201cWhen this evaluation is completed, we will have an updated foundational scientific evaluation that will inform the agency\u2019s future steps,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cSecretary Kennedy has long been at the forefront of this issue. His advocacy was instrumental in our decision to review fluoride exposure risks and we are committed to working alongside him, utilizing sound science as we advance our mission of protecting human health and the environment.\u201d",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d and said also it\u2019s been associated with arthritis, bone breaks, and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn.",
      "Fluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main one for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population gets fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water was long considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "About one-third of community water systems \u2014 17,000 out of 51,000 across the U.S. \u2014 serving more than 60% of the population fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 CDC analysis. The agency currently recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water.",
      "But over time, studies have documented potential problems. Too much fluoride has been associated with streaking or spots on teeth. Studies also have traced a link between excess fluoride and brain development.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program, which summarized studies conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico, concluded that drinking water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter \u2014 more than twice the recommended level in the U.S. \u2014 was associated with lower IQs in kids.",

      "Psarra said that while meals were provided for the camp\u2019s residents, the diet \u201cis not nutritious for children of this age.\u201d The situation was exacerbated by the severance nine months ago of a stipend provided to asylum seekers in Greece, which had allowed them to purchase fresh food and other basic necessities, she added.",
      "Officially designated as a \u201cclosed controlled access center,\u201d the European Union-funded migrant camp in Samos, built on a hillside about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the island\u2019s main port of Vathy, was opened in 2021 to replace a massively overcrowded camp that had developed on the town\u2019s fringes.",
      "The camp, which is guarded by police and private security, has a capacity of 3,664 people and as of Monday, it was housing 3,176 people, according to the Ministry of Migration and Asylum.",
      "Psarra noted that the children had already endured grueling journeys to arrive in Samos, and conditions inside the camp exacerbated their medical situation.",
      "Rights groups have reported dire conditions in the camp in Samos, including poor sanitation and a shortage of running water.",
      "\u201cThey are children who have been through painful journeys. They have had many difficulties in arriving,\u201d Psarra said of the malnourished children on Samos. \u201cThe conditions in the camp makes it even worse.\u201d",
      "Greece lies on one of the most popular routes into the EU for people fleeing conflict and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Many make the short but treacherous boat journey from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands like Samos, often in small, unseaworthy inflatable dinghies.",
      "Last week, at least seven people, including three children, died near another Greek island, Lesbos, after the inflatable dinghy they were traveling in sank. Another 23 people survived and were taken to a migrant camp in Lesbos.",

      "Health care systems can reduce suicides through patient screening, safety planning and mental health counseling, a new study suggests, an important finding as the U.S. confronts it 11th leading cause of death.",
      "The \u201cZero Suicide Model\u201d was developed in 2001 at Detroit-based Henry Ford Health, where the focus on people considering suicide included collaborating with patients to reduce their access to lethal means such as firearms and then following up with treatment.",
      "The approach made a difference, and for all of 2009, the health system saw no suicides among patients. The researchers then studied what happened when a different health system, Kaiser Permanente, adopted the program in four locations from 2012 through 2019.",
      "Suicides and suicide attempts fell in three of the locations, while the fourth maintained a low rate of suicides and attempts. Suicide attempts were tracked in electronic health records and insurance claims data. Suicides were measured using government death records.",
      "Reductions varied and reached up to 25%, said lead author Brian Ahmedani, of Henry Ford Health.",
      "\u201cOver the course of the year, that\u2019s up to 165 to 170 suicide attempts that were prevented at these participating health care systems,\u201d Ahmedani said.",
      "The study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open, shows the model works, said Katherine Keyes, a Columbia University public health professor who studies suicide.",
      "Prior research has shown that nearly everyone who dies by suicide is seen by a health care provider in the year before their death, Keyes said. Many doctor's offices have started asking patients whether they've thought about harming themselves.",
      "\u201cWe are coming into contact with people who are at high risk for suicide. If we don\u2019t ask them, we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Keyes who was not involved in the new study.",
      "Grants from the National Institute of Mental Health funded the research.",
      "\u201cComplex health problems like suicide cannot be challenged effectively without federal leadership,\u201d said Mike Hogan, who led mental health systems in Connecticut, Ohio and New York, and chaired President George W. Bush\u2019s commission on mental health in 2002 and 2003.",
      "\u201cThis is a very important research report, confirming that reducing suicide among people in health systems is possible,\u201d Hogan said.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the epicenter of Texas' still-growing measles outbreak on Sunday, the same day a funeral was held for a second young child who was not vaccinated and died from a measles-related illness.",
      "Kennedy said in a social media post that he was working to \u201ccontrol the outbreak\" and went to Gaines County to comfort the families who have buried two young children. He was seen late Sunday afternoon outside of a Mennonite church where the funeral services were held, but he did not attend a nearby news conference held by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the outbreak.",
      "Seminole is the epicenter of the outbreak, which started in late January and continues to swell \u2014 with nearly 500 cases in Texas alone, plus cases from the outbreak believed to have spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.",
      "The second young child died Thursday from \"what the child's doctor described as measles pulmonary failure,\u201d and did not have underlying health conditions, the Texas State Department of State Health Services said Sunday in a news release. Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, said that the child was \u201creceiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized.\u201d",
      "This is the third known measles-related death tied to this outbreak. One was another elementary school-aged child in Texas and the other was an adult in New Mexico; neither were vaccinated.",
      "It's Kennedy's first visit to the area as health secretary, where he said he met with families of both the 6- and 8-year-old children who died. He said he \u201cdeveloped bonds\u201d with the Mennonite community in West Texas in which the virus is mostly spreading.",
      "Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocate before ascending to the role of nation\u2019s top health secretary earlier this year, has resisted urging widespread vaccinations as the measles outbreak has worsened under his watch. On Sunday, however, he said in a lengthy statement posted on X that it was \u201cthe most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.\"",
      "The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has been used safely for more than 60 years and is 97% effective against measles after two doses.",
      "Dr. Manisha Patel, CDC incident manager, said in a Sunday news conference that the MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles. She also told parents in Gaines County that it was important not to \u201cdelay care\u201d for a child who is sick with measles.",
      "\u201cCall your doctor and make sure you\u2019re talking to a health care professional who can guide you on those next steps,\" Patel said.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s social media post said CDC employees had been \u201credeployed.\u201d CDC spokesman Jason McDonald clarified late Sunday that the first CDC team arrived in early March and left Gaines County on April 1, while a team led by Patel \u201cwas redeployed and arrived today to assess needs\" as ordered by Kennedy and requested by Texas' governor.",
      "Asked about the outbreak Sunday by reporters on Air Force One, Trump said, \u201cthey\u2019re doing reports on it,\u201d adding that if the outbreak \u201cprogresses, we\u2019ll will have to take action very strongly.\u201d",
      "Neither the CDC nor the state health department included the death in their measles reports issued Friday, but the CDC acknowledged it when asked Sunday.",
      "The number of cases in Texas shot up by 81 between March 28 and April 4, and 16 more people were hospitalized. Nationwide, the U.S. has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024.",
      "Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy from Louisiana, a liver doctor whose vote helped cinch Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, called Sunday for stronger messaging from health officials in a post on X.",
      "\u201cEveryone should be vaccinated! There is no treatment for measles. No benefit to getting measles,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTop health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies.\u201d",
      "Cassidy has requested Kennedy to appear before his health committee Thursday, although Kennedy has not publicly confirmed whether he will attend.",
      "A CDC spokesperson noted the efficacy of the measles vaccine Sunday but stopped short of calling on people to get it. Departing from long-standing public health messaging around vaccination, the spokesperson called the decision a \u201cpersonal one\u201d and encouraged people to talk with their doctor. People \u201cshould be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Misinformation about how to prevent and treat measles is hindering a robust public health response, including claims about vitamin A supplements that have been pushed by Kennedy and holistic medicine supporters despite doctors\u2019 warnings that it should be given under a physician's orders and that too much can be dangerous.",
      "Doctors at Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, where the first measles death occurred, say they've treated fewer than 10 children for liver issues from vitamin A toxicity, which they found when running routine lab tests on children who are not fully vaccinated and have measles. Dr. Lara Johnson, chief medical officer, said the patients reported using vitamin A to treat and prevent the virus.",
      "Dr. Peter Marks, the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s former vaccine chief, said responsibility for the death rests with Kennedy and his staff. Marks was forced out of the FDA after disagreements with Kennedy over vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cThis is the epitome of an absolute needless death,\u201d Marks told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday. \u201cThese kids should get vaccinated \u2014 that\u2019s how you prevent people from dying of measles.\u201d",
      "Marks also said he recently warned U.S. senators that more deaths would occur if the administration didn\u2019t mount a more aggressive response to the outbreak.",
      "Experts and local health officials expect the outbreak to go on for several more months if not a year. In West Texas, the vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated people and children younger than 17.",
      "With several states facing outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable disease \u2014 and declining childhood vaccination rates nationwide \u2014 some worry that measles may cost the U.S. its status as having eliminated the disease.",
      "Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years.",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Bickering and chaos overshadowed a presidential debate in Poland on Friday evening as eight candidates met to discuss existential matters for this country on NATO's eastern flank \u2014 including fears of Russia over its war in Ukraine and concerns about President Donald Trump\u2019s commitment to Europe\u2019s security.",
      "Poland is voting on May 18 to elect a new president as the outgoing leader, Andrzej Duda, nears the end of his second and final five-year term. If no candidate wins at least 50% of the vote, a runoff will take place June 1 between the top two.",
      "The heated discussions on display Friday underscored the deep division in this nation of 38 million.",
      "The debate was held in Konskie, a provincial town of 32,000 in central Poland seen as the kind of place crucial to winning an election in a country with many rural, conservative voters.",
      "It had the appearance of an unscripted, chaotic show.",
      "In the end, there were in fact two debates \u2014 the first one took place outdoors and was broadcast by two right-wing stations with rowdy onlookers whistling and booing candidates they didn\u2019t like. A left-wing candidate, Joanna Senyszyn, arrived late, joining the others about 20 minutes after the event began.",
      "Then the candidates moved to an indoor studio for the main debate, broadcast by the traditional broadcasters, TVN, TVP and Polsat.",
      "Some clarity came across. The candidates were asked about whether they want a return to compulsory conscription in the army. The frontrunners said they don\u2019t.",
      "They were asked what a president should do to ensure energy stability in Poland, which has been trying to free itself from Russian energy. They variously stressed support for renewable sources, nuclear energy or relying more on Poland's own coal. Only one said he supported using Russian energy.",
      "Until the last moment it wasn't clear if the debate would happen at all, or in what format, amid arguments over who should be included and who not, and over which of the television broadcasters should be allowed to transmit the debate.",
      "Friday's debate was originally meant to include only the two top candidates, liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski and conservative historian Karol Nawrocki.",
      "But others contenders protested that format, saying it was unfair to exclude them. They ended up traveling to Konskie and demanding they be included as well. At the last moment they were.",
      "Nawrocki, 42, also protested the exclusion of the two right-wing stations \u2014 TV Republika and wPolsce24 \u2014 from being allowed to broadcast the debate. Many from his political camp consider TVN and TVP to be biased against them.",
      "Trzaskowski, a 53-year-old from Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s pro-European Union party is the frontrunner, with over 30% in recent polls. He is followed in most polls by Nawrocki, the director of a state historical institute backed by Law and Justice, the national conservative party that governed Poland from 2015-23. Nawrocki has been polling at a bit over 20%.",
      "But Trzaskowski \u2014 who only attended the second debate Friday \u2014 cannot rest easy as Nawrocki could expect to pick up in the second round some support now going to a far-right candidate, S\u0142awomir Mentzen.",
      "Mentzen has enjoyed a surge in popularity, especially among young men, part of a larger rise of far-right populists across Europe. He seemed to be surging ahead of Nawrocki briefly, but slipped back to third place after calling for an end to free university tuition and saying be believes abortion should be banned \u2014 even in cases where a pregnancy results from rape.",
      "Mentzen did not join either of the debates, saying he didn\u2019t want to take part in a \u201ccircus.\u201d",
      "Nawrocki clearly seeks to tap into conservative voters. His campaign has been trying to highlight Trzaskowski's support for rights of the LGBTQ+ community to discredit him with conservatives",
      "During the debate, Nawrocki carried a little rainbow flag and put it on Trzaskowski's podium, and Trzaskowski removed it, telling him: \"You have an obsession with gays.\"",
      "Later, a left-wing lawmaker, Magdalena Biejat, walked across the stage, took the flag and placed it proudly on her podium.",
      "Located on the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union, Poland has been a strong supporter of Kyiv, supplying its ally with weapons and openings its door to Ukrainian refugees. Fears have been high since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",

    "story": [
      "Argentine President Javier Milei\u2019s economy minister says the libertarian government would lift the country\u2019s strict capital and currency controls in a few days",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- The libertarian government of President Javier Milei on Friday announced that it would lift most of the country\u2019s strict capital and currency controls next week, a high-stakes gamble made possible by a new loan from the International Monetary Fund.",
      "In a nationally televised address, Economy Minister Luis Caputo said the IMF\u2019s executive board had decided to approve the $20 billion bailout package announced earlier this week, which offers a lifeline to Argentina\u2019s dangerously depleting foreign currency reserves.",
      "\u201cThe agreement will allow us, starting Monday, to lift the exchange rate controls that so severely limit the normal functioning of the economy,\u201d Caputo said from the government headquarters in Buenos Aires. \u201cInvestments that are currently pending will begin to come into Argentina to take us to this new stage.\u201d",
      "The capital controls, known here as \u201cel cepo,\u201d or \u201cthe trap, \u201d are a tangle of regulations that help to stabilize the peso at an official rate and prevent capital flight from Argentina.",
      "Imposed by a previous administration in 2019, the restrictions curb individuals\u2019 and companies\u2019 access to dollars, discouraging the foreign investment that Milei needs to achieve his goal of transforming heavily regulated Argentina into a free economy. The restrictions have given rise to a black market exchange rate for dollars that is technically illegal but that almost every Argentine uses to sell their depreciating pesos anyway.",
      "Caputo said the central bank would receive $12 billion from the IMF on Tuesday \u2014 a bigger-than-expected upfront sum that gives Argentina's reserves breathing room to make the major change and reflects the fund's confidence in Milei's radical reforms.",
      "\u201cThe Fund told us that what we\u2019d done was practically impossible,\u201d Caputo said.",
      "The new policy also involves cutting the Argentine peso free from its peg to the dollar and letting it trade within a so-called currency band that ranges from 1,000 to 1,400 pesos per dollar. The band will expand 1% each month, the bank said.",
      "This breaks from Milei's current policy of letting the peso weaken at a pace of just 1% per month against the dollar. The crawling peg has faced backlash from investors concerned about the government burning through its reserves to prop up the peso and from business leaders upset that a strong peso was hurting the competitiveness of their exports and widening the country\u2019s trade balance. It also has made Argentina much more expensive in dollar terms.",
      "Milei has sought to fend off a politically costly official devaluation, which sparks inflation. Keeping a lid on rising prices \u2014 a flagship campaign promise \u2014 has helped him hold up approval ratings despite his brutal cuts to state spending that might otherwise trigger social unrest.",
      "\"A big question mark is inflation in the second quarter of the year. It\u2019s very likely there will be a shock,\u201d said Leonardo Piazza, chief economist at Argentine consulting firm LP Consulting.",
      "The announcement came as the IMF\u2019s executive board was preparing to approve the new $20 billion loan with Argentina, the 23rd rescue package in the nation's long and tumultuous history. The South American nation is already the IMF's biggest debtor, owing some $43 billion.",
      "After the unusually large first $12 billion disbursement from the IMF hits Argentina's central bank Tuesday, another $2 billion will arrive in the next two months, the government said. International organizations like the World Bank will contribute several billion more dollars as part of the deal.",
      "Before Milei took office in December 2023, the previous left-wing Peronist administration ran up massive budget deficits, leading to sky-high inflation and a chronically weakening peso.",
      "By scrapping subsidies and price controls, firing tens of thousands of state workers and halting the central bank's reckless money-printing, Milei has delivered Argentina's first fiscal surplus in years and largely stabilized its macroeconomic imbalances, thrilling markets even as his shock-therapy approach has hit the population hard.",
      "Yet for all the changes, there have been scant signs of a sustainable economic recovery \u2014 involving the removal of capital controls, the amassing of currency reserves and access to international capital markets. Despite an incentive scheme, foreign investors remained wary of pouring their cash into a country infamous for defaulting on its debt.",
      "Milei has long described lifting the controls as an important goal, but said the economic conditions needed to be right. It's a high-risk mission, as scrapping the \u201ccepo\u201d could unleash years of pent-up demand for U.S. dollars and spark a currency run as companies try to send their long-trapped profits home.",
      "\u201cIt could be a tsunami of money out,\u201d said Christopher Ecclestone, a strategist with investment bank Hallgarten & Company. \u201cIt\u2019s a total guessing game as to what people will do.\u201d",
      "As a result, the government said that while it was lifting restrictions for individuals, it would retain some regulations for companies. Capital flight could imperil his primary accomplishment of lowering inflation ahead of crucial midterm elections in October in which his libertarian party hopes to expand its small congressional minority.",
      "\u201cThe announcement is more audacious than expected. The government is making a bit of a leap of faith by lifting the cepo,\u201d said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, director for the Americas at New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. \u201cIt is bolder than one could have imagined at the start of an electoral year.\u201d",
      "As uncertainty over the IMF deal spread jitters among investors, the closely watched gap between the parallel black market rate and the official exchange rate widened by over 20% in recent week, with the black market rate dropping to 1,350 pesos per dollar and the official rate currently hovering just over 1,100.",
      "Garc\u00eda said he expects an initial devaluation of around 20-25% for the government let the peso float \u2014 or, rather, sink \u2014 against the U.S. dollar and move within the currency band of 1,000-1,400.",
      "An abrupt devaluation would increase price pressures at a time when Milei's progress against inflation stalls.",
      "On Friday, Argentina\u2019s National Statistics Institute, or INDEC, reported that monthly inflation had accelerated in March to its fastest pace in seven months, with consumer prices up 3.7% compared to 2.4% in February, mainly as a result of rising food prices.",

      "The hostages, including 13 women and several foreigners, were released from the custody of the Allied Democratic Forces extremist group in North Kivu province's Lubero and Beni territories during a joint military operation with neighboring Ugandan troops, according to Mak Hazukay, a spokesman for Congo army in the province.",
      "Some of the hostages looked unkept and haggard as they were freed in Beni on Friday.",

      "A bomb planted near the offices of Hellenic Train, Greece\u2019s main railway company, has exploded in a busy district of central Athens, authorities say, causing limited damage but no injuries",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- A bomb planted near the offices of Hellenic Train, Greece's main railway company, exploded Friday night in a busy district of central Athens, authorities said. There were no reports of injuries.",
      "The explosion comes amid widespread public anger over a 2023 railway disaster, Greece\u2019s worst, in which 57 people were killed and dozens more injured when a freight train and a passenger train heading in opposite directions were accidentally put on the same track.",
      "Local media said a newspaper and a news website had received an anonymous call shortly before Friday\u2019s blast, with the caller warning that a bomb had been planted outside the railway company offices and would explode within about 40 minutes.",
      "In a statement, Hellenic Train said the explosion had occurred \u201cvery close to its central offices\u201d and said the blast had caused limited damage and no injuries to any employees or passers-by.",
      "It said authorities had acted immediately upon receiving information about the warning call, and that the company was cooperating fully with authorities and ensuring the safety of its staff.",
      "Police cordoned off the site along a major avenue in the Greek capital, keeping residents and tourists away from the building in an area with several bars and restaurants. Officers at the scene said a bag containing an explosive device had been placed near the Hellenic Train building on Syngrou Avenue.",
      "Police forensics experts wearing white coveralls were collecting evidence at the scene.",
      "Criticism over the government\u2019s handling of the Feb. 28, 2023 collision at Tempe in northern Greece has mounted over the last few weeks in the wake of the second anniversary of the disaster, which killed mostly young people who had been returning to university classes after a public holiday.",
      "The crash exposed severe deficiencies in Greece\u2019s railway system, including in safety systems, and has triggered mass protests - led by relatives of the victims - against the country\u2019s conservative government. Critics accused authorities of failing to take political responsibility for the disaster or holding senior officials accountable.",
      "So far, only rail officials have been charged with any crimes. Several protests in recent weeks have turned violent, with demonstrators clashing with police.",

      "While the groups most active in the 1980s and 1990s have been dismantled, new small groups have emerged. Last year, a man believed to have been trying to assemble a bomb was killed when the explosive device he was making exploded in a central Athens apartment. A woman inside the apartment was severely injured. The blast had prompted Minister of Citizen Protection Michalis Chrisochoidis to warn of an emerging new generation of domestic extremists.",

      "Lebanon\u2019s lead investigator into the 2020 Beirut port blast has questioned two former security chiefs, including Maj. Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, who appeared in court for the first time",
      "BEIRUT -- The Lebanese judge investigating the massive 2020 Beirut port explosion questioned two former security chiefs on Friday, including a former head of the General Security Directorate who appeared in court for the first time since being summoned nearly four years ago, according to four judicial and two security officials.",
      "The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. The hearings mark a rare breakthrough in the long-stalled probe.",
      "Maj. Gen. Abbas Ibrahim and former head of State Security Maj. Gen. Tony Saliba, are among several officials charged in connection with the blast that killed over 220 people. The specific charges have not been disclosed.\u200b",
      "Ibrahim appeared in court for the first time, where Judge Tarek Bitar questioned him about the operations of the General Security Directorate during his tenure and requested related documents, which Ibrahim\u2019s lawyer is expected to submit next week.",
      "Ibrahim, who headed the General Security Directorate between 2011 and 2023, is known for wide connections with local, regional and international figures, including the Iran-backed militant Hezbollah group, the Syrian government and Western nations, making him a key political mediator.",
      "Ibrahim\u2019s attorneys said in a statement that the former General Security chief appeared in court despite having previously filed a legal challenge against Judge Bitar and despite claiming that he was immune from prosecution.",
      "His attorneys said he appeared as a \u201cmark of respect for the families of the martyrs and victims, his belief in justice and truth, and his commitment to upholding legal procedures and the course of justice.\u201d",
      "Saliba, appearing in court for the fourth time, cooperated with the hearing, providing documentation pertaining to his role at State Security. After the hearing, Saliba described the proceedings as \u201cpositive\" in a statement.",
      "On Aug. 4, 2020, hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a Beirut Port warehouse, killing at least 218 people, injuring more than 6,000 and devastating large swaths of the capital. The blast, one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history, caused billions of dollars in damage and sent shockwaves through the nation\u2019s capital.",
      "Following years of political obstruction, Bitar resumed the stalled investigation in mid-January, questioning port and customs employees, retired military officials, the former head of port security, the former army intelligence director, and 12 witnesses.",
      "This development coincides with significant political changes in Lebanon, including the election of Joseph Aoun as president and the appointment of Nawaf Salam as prime minister. Both are perceived as outside the traditional political establishment, which includes many figures charged in the port explosion case.\u200b",
      "Several officials implicated in the investigation have accused Bitar of bias, refused to testify, and filed legal complaints against him.",
      "Next week, Bitar is expected to question top former political leaders. Former Prime Minister Hassan Diab, who was in office at the time of the port explosion and is among those charged by Bitar, is scheduled to appear in court in May. His hearing will be followed by the questioning of four judges.",
      "Meanwhile, a French delegation is expected to submit their findings from their investigation into the explosion later in April. France initiated its own probe into the explosion in 2020 after three French nationals were killed in the blast. However, French judges have faced obstacles accessing documents from the Lebanese investigation, which has been hindered by political interference.",

      "Italian authorities say 40 migrants with no permission to remain on Italian soil are being transferred from Italy to Albania",
      "ROME -- Italian authorities said Friday they were transferring 40 migrants with no permission to remain in the country to Italian-run migration detention centers in Albania. It appeared to be the first time a European Union country was sending rejected migrants to a nation outside the EU that is neither their own nor a country they had transited on their journey.",
      "Italian media reported the migrants had left the Italian port of Brindisi. The Italian government has not released their nationalities or further details.",
      "The migrants will be held in Italian-built and run migrant centers located in Shengjin port, 66 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the capital, Tirana, and in Gjader. They were built to process asylum requests of migrants intercepted in the Mediterranean Sea by Italy. But since their inauguration in October, Italian courts have stopped authorities from using them and small groups of migrants were returned to Italy.",
      "It is not clear how long the rejected asylum-seekers may stay in Albania. In Italy they can be detained for up to 18 months pending deportation.",
      "Italy\u2019s far-right-led government of Premier Giorgia Meloni approved a decree last month that expanded the use of the Albanian fast-track asylum processing centers to include the detention of rejected asylum seekers with deportation orders.",
      "While the announcement was in line with a recent EU Commission proposal that would allow EU countries to set up so-called \u201creturn hubs,\" the proposal has yet to be fully approved. Migrant rights organizations and lawyers say it violates the right to seek asylum and sets a dangerous precedent.",
      "Migration experts consulted by The Associated Press say it's unclear how legal Italy's actions were and that they would likely be challenged in court.",
      "\u201cThey need to show they are doing something with this incredibly expensive structure,\u201d said Meghan Benton of the Migration Policy Institute. Speaking from Toulouse, France, Benton said other EU countries are interested in doing the same, including the Netherlands with Uganda.",
      "Francesco Ferri, a migration expert with Action Aid, who was among a group of nongovernmental organizations and Italian lawmakers visiting Albania to follow the migrant transfer, said there is no legislation in Italian law, nor in EU law, nor in the Albania-Italy agreement that would allow rejected asylum-seekers to be deported directly from Albania, making the purpose of the transfer unclear.",
      "\u201cFor us it is unacceptable,\u201d Ferri said.",
      "The Albanian centers opened in October but they remained substantially inactive due to legal hurdles and wide opposition from human rights associations, which believe they violate international laws and put migrants\u2019 rights at risk.",
      "The November 2023 agreement between Italy and Albania\u2014 worth nearly 800 million euros over five years \u2014 allows up to 3,000 migrants intercepted by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month to be sheltered in Albania and vetted for possible asylum in Italy or repatriation.",
      "Italy has agreed to welcome those migrants who are granted asylum, while those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania.",
      "The first three groups of 73 migrants transferred there in October, November and January spent only a few hours in Albania and were returned to Italy after Italian magistrates refused to validate their detention in the non-EU country.",
      "So far this year, 11,438 migrants landed on Italian shores, less than the 16,090 who arrived in the same period last year. Most arrived from Bangladesh, followed by Syria, Tunisia and Egypt, according to the Italian Interior Ministry. ____",

      "Imamoglu was arrested on March 19 in relation to two investigations, one focusing on corruption in the Istanbul municipality and another alleging terrorism links in his party\u2019s electoral pact with pro-Kurdish politicians.",
      "Demonstrations calling for his release and an end to Turkey\u2019s democratic backsliding under Erdogan led to some 2,000 people being detained for attending protests banned by the authorities.",
      "The mayor was officially nominated as the CHP presidential candidate while in custody. An election is due to be held in 2028 but may come sooner, and Imamoglu\u2019s imprisonment has been widely viewed as politically motivated although the government insists Turkey\u2019s judiciary is independent and free of political influence.",
      "Also Friday, two other courts in Istanbul were also holding hearings on cases against Imamoglu.",
      "One is a bid-rigging case that dates back 10 years, when he was mayor of Istanbul\u2019s Beylikduzu district. The other alleges illegal donation collection and stems from a video circulated in the runup to last year\u2019s local elections showing CHP staff counting bundles of cash.",

      "Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol left the presidential residence in Seoul on Friday for his private home, a week after the Constitutional Court removed him from office over his ill-fated imposition of martial law in December",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol left the presidential residence in Seoul on Friday for his private home, a week after the Constitutional Court removed him from office over his ill-fated imposition of martial law in December.",
      "In recent days, moving trucks were seen driving in and out of the walled presidential compound in the Hannam-dong district, the site of a massive law enforcement operation in January that led to Yoon\u2019s detainment. Yoon, who is facing a criminal trial on rebellion charges, was released from custody in March after a Seoul court canceled his arrest.",
      "Yoon and his wife, Kim Keon Hee, along with their 11 dogs and cats, returned to their private apartment in affluent southern Seoul. As his black van arrived at the gate of the presidential compound, Yoon stepped out, smiling and waving to his supporters, shaking hands and embracing dozens of them, before getting back into the vehicle and leaving the site.",
      "Arriving at the apartment complex where his private residence is located, Yoon stepped out of the van again and walked slowly through a crowd of supporters, shaking their hands as they chanted his name, as his wife closely followed.",
      "Dozens of both supporters and critics of Yoon rallied in nearby streets amid a heavy police presence, holding signs that ran from \u201cYour excellency Yoon, we will carry on with your spirit\u201d to \u201cGive Yoon Suk Yeol the death penalty!\u201d",
      "In a separate public message, Yoon expressed gratitude to his supporters who had protested for months calling for his reinstatement, and stressed that he will \u201ccontinue to do my utmost\u201d to build the \u201cfree and prosperous Republic of Korea that we have dreamed of together,\" invoking South Korea's formal name.",
      "Yoon, a conservative who narrowly won the 2022 election, declared martial law on late-night television on Dec. 3, vowing to eradicate \u201canti-state\u201d liberals whom he accused of abusing their legislative majority to obstruct his agenda. Yoon also declared a suspension of legislative activities and sent hundreds of troops to surround the National Assembly, but lawmakers still managed to form a quorum and voted to lift martial law just hours after it was imposed.",
      "Yoon\u2019s powers were suspended after the Assembly impeached him on Dec. 14. The Constitutional Court upheld impeachment and formally removed him from office last week, triggering a presidential election the government set for June 3.",
      "Despite his self-inflicted downfall, it\u2019s unlikely that Yoon will fade into the background, experts say. With the country entering election mode, he may try to rally his supporters while seeking to tighten his grip on the conservative People Power Party, whose leadership is stacked with loyalists.",
      "Facing a separate criminal trial on rebellion charges, which are punishable by death or life in prison, Yoon would strongly prefer a conservative president who could pardon him if convicted and is likely to push to ensure the party\u2019s primaries are won by a candidate he supports, experts say.",

      "On the eve of the meeting of Ukraine's Western backers at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said a key issue was strengthening his country\u2019s air defenses. \u201cUkraine needs a sufficient number of modern systems like Patriot\u201d missile systems, he said in a post on social media.",
      "\u201cA political decision is needed to supply these systems to protect our cities, towns, and the lives of our people \u2014 especially from the threat of Russian ballistic weapons. Our partners have such available systems,\u201d Umerov said.",

      "The Sao Paulo Museum of Art has opened a new building, bringing to completion its architectural vision 77 years after the facility's inauguration",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 S\u00e3o Paulo is marking the opening of its famed art museum's new building with a Renoir exhibit and art lovers are already flocking to the Brazilian city.",
      "The new, 14-story tower of Sao Paulo Museum of Art \u2014 better known as MASP after its initials and one of the country's most visited \u2014 opened its doors on March 28, bringing to completion its architectural vision 77 years after the museum was inaugurated.",
      "The tower is named after the museum's first artistic director, Pietro Maria Bardi, and includes five exhibition galleries, two multi-purpose galleries, a restoration lab, classrooms, a restaurant, and a museum shop.",
      "The 13 works by French impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir are a special draw and treat to visitors, while others come eager to see how the original red MASP building blends with the new addition on the Paulista Avenue, Brazil's most recognizable business road.",
      "Next month, the museum will host an exhibition of works of Claude Monet, another French impressionist and an art fan favorite in Brazil.",
      "The new building more than doubles the museum space to 7,821 square meters (84,184 square feet), increasing MASP's exhibition capacity by 66%. Its fa\u00e7ade is made of perforated and pleated metal sheets, which add to the brutalist style conception of the original building next to it.",
      "Construction started in 2019 and was entirely sponsored by donors who spent about 250 million Brazilian reais ($43 million) on the project, inspired by vertical museum typologies such as those in New York City, MASP said.",
      "\u201cMASP is the main museum in the Southern Hemisphere in terms of European art collection,\" said said Paulo Vicelli, MASP\u2019s director for experience and communication. \"We have more than 11,000 works; Amedeo Modigliani, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Vincent van Gogh, Rafael, the great masters. But also important artists from Brazil.\u201d",
      "\u201cArt can transform people, the city,\" he added. \"Everyone who comes leaves a different person.\u201d",
      "The original MASP building was in a different venue for 20 years but then in 1968 moved to the Paulista Avenue. The museum \u2014 a prime example of brutalism, a form characterized by exposed concrete structures, emphasis on raw materials and monumental scale \u2014 is the work of architect Lina Bo Bardi.",
      "Over the years, it has become one of Sao Paulo's most recognizable touristic attractions.",
      "\u201cMASP has grown and become bigger than its building. It was necessary to push the boundaries,\u201d said museum director Heitor Martins. \u201cThis is a historic moment. ... Two buildings form one museum.\u201d",
      "An underground walkway connecting the two buildings is expected to be completed in November. Until then, visitors will have to briefly step out on the busy Paulista Avenue to move from one building to the other.",
      "Naira Regis de Moura, a 60-year old tourist from the southern city of Porto Alegre, said she was moved when she saw MASP's new tower. She came to Sao Paulo for a concert, but found a way to squeeze a museum visit into her schedule.",
      "\u201cThis is a landmark for Brazilian art,\u201d she said.",

      "Before he was a rebel, Asres Mare Damte was a lawyer. Today he fights for the Fano, a loose collection of groups taking on Ethiopia\u2019s military in one of its most populous and powerful regions.",
      "The conflict in Amhara has simmered largely out of sight, with access limited by authorities and insecurity. But a rare interview with Asres, deputy of an influential Fano faction, and others on the ground give a sense of its impact.",
      "Ethiopia's federal government has long been challenged to hold together a potent mix of ethnic groups and interests. Sometimes, as recently in the Tigray region, it explodes into war.",
      "The Amhara, Ethiopia\u2019s second-largest ethnic group, once dominated national politics. Many among the rebels want to see them in power again. But they also claim the Amhara are under attack, citing ethnic-based violence in parts of Ethiopia where they are a minority.",
      "The extent of the Amhara fighting has been difficult to measure since the Fano emerged during anti-government protests in 2016.",
      "Alliances in Ethiopia can be shifting. During the Tigray conflict, the Fano fought alongside Ethiopian forces. Afterward, angered by certain terms of the peace deal, the rebels turned against the federal government once again.",
      "Before taking up arms, Asres said he coordinated peaceful demonstrations to protest the killing of Amharas. He was arrested twice and fled in 2022 after a third warrant was issued.",
      "These days, he and fellow fighters live in fear of drone strikes by Ethiopian forces. He makes bullish, unverified claims.",
      "\u201cWe have fought thousands of battles,\u201d he told The Associated Press from Amhara\u2019s Gojjam area, which has seen some of the heaviest battles. He claimed that the Fano control over 80% of Amhara, a mountainous region of over 22 million people, and has captured \u201cmany enemy troops.\u201d",
      "In a statement last month, Amhara\u2019s deputy head of security said the government had \u201cfreed\u201d 2,225 of Amhara\u2019s 4,174 subdistricts. It was not clear how many more were under Fano control.",
      "Fighting has escalated since mid-March, with the Fano launching an offensive across Amhara. The military has claimed it \u201ccrushed\u201d the offensive and killed 300 Fano fighters, but reports of clashes persist.",
      "Amhara's large population has long created pressure to expand, and the ethnic group has claimed the western part of Tigray. The Fano and Amhara regional forces seized it during the Tigray conflict, but they were left out of peace negotiations. They were angered to learn that western Tigray's fate might be left up to a referendum, which has not been held.",
      "It is \"not a genuine peace,\u201d Asres said.",
      "After several months of small-scale skirmishes, Amhara saw open rebellion in July 2023, when Fano groups launched a coordinated offensive and briefly seized control of several towns.",
      "They retreated to the countryside and have waged a hit-and-run guerrilla campaign since then, setting up checkpoints on key roads and often entering major urban areas.",
      "\u201cOne week you\u2019re ruled by one, one week you\u2019re ruled by the other,\u201d said a mother of three in the southern town of Debre Markos, referring to the rebels and Ethiopia's military. She spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.",
      "The monitoring group ACLED recorded 270 battles between Fano and government forces between Oct. 27 of last year and Jan. 31, as well as over a dozen attacks targeting health facilities and doctors in Amhara since last April.",
      "Residents and observers say some local officials have fled their posts for fear of assassination, while police struggle to maintain control.",
      "The regional education office says over 3,600 schools across Amhara are closed, with many looted or damaged, depriving 4.5 million children of schooling. The government said 2.3 million people needed food aid in 2024, many in hard-to-reach areas.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t travel from one city to another safely. Work has stopped,\u201d said Tadesse Gete, a barber based in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, but from North Gondar, one of the fighting's hot spots. He said his family fled for safety.",
      "Rights groups have accused Ethiopia\u2019s military of abuses including extrajudicial killings, drone strikes against civilians and enforced disappearances of alleged Fano sympathizers. Human Rights Watch last year said it had documented attacks by Ethiopian soldiers and allied militias in at least 13 Amhara towns since August 2023.",
      "The bloodiest known episode was in February 2024 in Merawi, 30 kilometers (18 miles) south of Amhara's regional capital, when Ethiopian troops went door-to-door rounding up and executing civilians following a Fano attack, according to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. The state-appointed human rights commission said at least 45 civilians were killed.",
      "\u201cThe Ethiopian authorities have taken no meaningful steps to hold perpetrators accountable,\u201d said Haimanot Bejiga, a researcher for Amnesty International.",

      "The government has restricted access to Brakat and has not commented.",
      "The government did not respond to AP questions. It has accused the Fano of \u201cterrorizing the people\u201d. But it has also formed regional peace councils, and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed last year said his government had been in talks for \u201ca while\u201d with Fano groups.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea has established diplomatic relations with Syria\u2019s new Islamist government, Seoul\u2019s foreign ministry said Friday, months after a rebel coalition ousted President Bashar Assad, who had maintained close ties with North Korea. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul traveled to Damascus on Thursday to sign a joint communique with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani establishing formal diplomatic relations \u2014 a move the South Korean ministry said opens new opportunities for bilateral cooperation previously hindered by Syria\u2019s \u201cclose ties with North Korea.\u201d",
      "Cho during the talks conveyed Seoul\u2019s willingness to support Syria\u2019s reconstruction efforts following the 13-year civil war, a process that he said could eventually involve South Korean businesses, and to expand humanitarian aid.",
      "Al-Shaibani welcomed the prospect of South Korean contributions to Syria\u2019s reconstruction and expressed hope for Seoul\u2019s support in easing international sanctions on Damascus, the South Korean ministry said.",
      "South Korea now has diplomatic relations with all 191 U.N. member states except for its war-divided rival, North Korea. Relations between the Koreas are now at their worst in years as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un continues to flaunt his nuclear weapons and missile program and provide arms and troops to Russia to fuel its warfighting in Ukraine.",
      "North Korean state media didn\u2019t immediately comment on South Korea establishing ties with Syria.",
      "South Korea also established diplomatic relations with Cuba last year, which the Seoul government then claimed would deal a \u201cpolitical and psychological blow\u201d to the North, whose diplomatic footing is largely dependent on a limited number of Cold War allies.",

      "RABAT, Morocco -- RABAT, Morocco (AP) \u2014 Morocco 's social security agency said troves of data were stolen from its systems in a cyberattack this week that resulted in personal information being leaked on the messaging app Telegram.",
      "The North African kingdom\u2019s social security fund administers pensions and insurance benefits to millions of private sector workers, from assembly line laborers to corporate executives. It said in a statement Wednesday that preliminary investigations suggest the leak resulted from hackers bypassing its security systems.",

Among the leaked documents is salary information that, if accurate, would reflect vast inequalities that continue to plague Morocco despite its strides in economic development. The trove includes unverified financial data on executives of state-owned companies, political parties, figures associated with the royal family's holding company and charity fund, and the Israeli liaison office in Rabat.",

Tate, 38, will not be present as he and his younger brother Tristan Tate face charges in Romania over human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women.",

      "Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said the government has approved the disbursement of $3.1 million, the first such payment under a deal signed between President Emmerson Mnangagwa and dispossessed white farmers in 2020.",
      "Ncube said in a statement this week that the amount is equivalent to 1% of the total compensation claim of $311 million. He said 740 farms have been approved for compensation, with 378 benefiting from the first batch of payments.",
      "About 4,000 white farmers lost their homes and swathes of land when the Black-majority country\u2019s then-president, Robert Mugabe, launched the often-chaotic redistribution program in 2000.",

      "According to the deal, the farmers would receive 1% of their claim in cash, with the balance being settled through the issuance of treasury bonds. The government issued treasury bonds related to the first batch of farmers last week, said Ncube.",
      "The government also paid out an initial $20 million in February to foreign farmers from Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland and several countries in Eastern Europe as compensation in connection with the land reform program, despite bilateral agreements protecting such property from seizure.",
      "The compensation payments are part of conditions of a debt resolution and international re-engagement strategy by Zimbabwe after years of sanctions and isolation by the United States and other Western countries.",
      "The U.S. and the European Union imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe and dozens of its officials, citing human rights abuses that included often violent attacks on white farmers and seizures of their land. Those measures have been gradually eased over the years, although Mnangagwa and some members of his inner circle remain under sanctions.",

In February, he backed Trump\u2019s moves to deport undocumented migrants. Last week, he offered support to Trump\u2019s harsh tariff regime and said Zimbabwe in response would slash tariffs on U.S imported goods to zero \u201cin the spirit of constructing a mutually beneficial and positive relationship.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping global tariffs could cause planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to drop temporarily, but that won\u2019t help the climate long-term",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping global tariffs have stirred widespread anxiety about a severe economic downturn -- and curiosity, for some, about how it might affect the world\u2019s warming climate.",
      "Experts say a slowdown in international trade might have a brief and slight benefit in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which come in part from fuels like gas and oil that are used to move goods around the world via ships, planes and vehicles. But any such benefit in reducing emissions, which cause climate change, will be swamped by sharply rising costs worldwide that will hurt efforts to transition to green energies.",
      "\u201cI would say it might help the climate in the first year or two if we have a downturn in economic activity or a recession, which no one wants,\u201d said Rob Jackson, head of the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who monitor greenhouse gas emissions yearly. \u201cBut it will hurt the climate long-term because tariffs impact clean tech more than most other industries because of trade with China.",
      "\u201cAny emissions reduction would be temporary,\" said Dan Jasper, senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown. \u201cI'm deeply skeptical that this would have positive impacts on climate change and in particular the energy transition.\u201d",
      "Climate experts have closely studied changes in world economic activity the last century, from the Great Depression to the recent coronavirus pandemic, looking for insights to help shape policies to reduce carbon emissions. A major U.S.-China trade war would be a very different dynamic than other recent slowdowns, as China produces much of the equipment needed for a transition to renewable energies, such as solar panels.",
      "Trump imposed, then suspended for 90 days, import taxes on dozens of countries Wednesday. He escalated his trade war with China, raising tariffs on its products to well above 100%. China makes more than 80% of the world\u2019s solar panels.",
      "The tariffs could slow global trade and economic activity. Carbon dioxide emissions dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and during the global financial crisis in 2009, then rebounded within a year.",
      "Jackson said he expects at most a 1% drop in emissions if full tariffs are implemented \u2014 significant, but far less than the 5.7% that his group calculated for the pandemic's first year. And Jackson noted that the world can't reach net-zero carbon emissions to try to limit future warming without structural changes, namely replacing fossil energy and manufacturing with clean renewable energy.",
      "\u201cA drop in emissions is important. But it boomerangs back to the same levels or keeps increasing afterwards,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we really haven\u2019t done anything meaningful to address climate issues.\u201d",
      "Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, also thinks there could be a slight, temporary drop in greenhouse gas emissions if tariffs paralyze businesses and people aren't working. But, he said, the higher prices for components for new renewable energy facilities will make some not economical to build and there will be far fewer imports of electric vehicles, both of which will lead to more emissions.",
      "The transition to electric vehicles is an important part of the shift to clean energy to reduce emissions from road transport. The United States is a top importer of EVs and China is a top exporter.",
      "Renewable energy investor Excelsior Energy Capital announced Tuesday that it has raised just over $1 billion to continue investing equity in solar, energy storage, wind and other energy transition projects across the United States. Co-founder and managing partner Chris Moakley said they need stability and predictable costs \u2014 tariffs cause volatility.",
      "\u201cIf there is an increase in tariffs, I think there\u2019s going to be a time where we will have a slowdown,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall economics of these investments and transactions, there's going to need to be a reset.\u201d",
      "Grid-scale batteries and solar panels, as well as power transformers, are among the hardest hit by price increases on imports, said David Shepheard, partner and energy expert at the global consultant Baringa.",
      "Combining batteries with green energy is a fast-growing climate solution. Batteries allow renewables to replace fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, while keeping a steady flow of power when sources like wind and solar are not producing. Shepheard calculated a 55% price increase for grid-scale batteries if the tariffs are fully implemented on China, where about 80% of these batteries are manufactured, undermining the case for using solar and battery storage to satisfy a surging demand for electricity.",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles-area residents whose homes survived the Eaton wildfire in January face a whole different set of struggles to their neighbors whose homes were burned to the ground",
      "All sense of survivors\u2019 guilt was fleeting for those residents whose homes remained standing after wildfires ripped through the Los Angeles area three months ago.",
      "Many worried that smoke from the Eaton wildfire that destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 18 people may have carried toxins, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals, into their homes. But they struggled to convince their insurers to test their properties to ensure it was safe to return.",
      "Nicole Maccalla, a data scientist, said embers burned more than half of her roof, several windows and eaves were damaged, and her house in Altadena was left filled with ash, debris, soot and damaged appliances. She said her insurance adjuster said USAA would pay for contamination testing, but after choosing a company and coming back with the results, her claim was rejected. The adjuster said the company only covered testing in homes with major damage.",
      "\u201cEvery single item is a battle,\u201d said Maccalla. \u201cIt\u2019s denials and appeals and denials and appeals, and you wait weeks and weeks and weeks for responses.\u201d",
      "Maccalla and others banded together as Eaton Fire Residents Unite, sharing environmental testing data and compiling the results in an online map. Of 81 homes tested so far for lead, all show elevated levels, according to the group.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve already had multiple people reach out and say: \u2018Thank you for publishing this map \u2026 because my insurance company has changed their mind and approved testing,\u2019\u201d said Maccalla, who helped design the data collection to verify results and maintain privacy.",
      "Many homeowners paid privately for the testing after their insurance companies refused, revealing gaps in coverage. The group hopes the data will help residents who can\u2019t afford it to convince their insurers to cover testing and remediation.",
      "\u201cIf I can prove my community is not fit for human habitation then maybe I can show my home won\u2019t be,\u201d said Jane Lawton Potelle, founder of Eaton Fire Residents Unite.",
      "It's not easy to understand how and when it is safe to return home, Lawton Potelle said. The fine print of insurance policies can be frustrating and confusing, and the government has not stepped in to help.",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has no plans to conduct widespread environmental testing. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is tracking environmental testing largely by academic researchers and a handful from government agencies, but most studies assess outdoor contamination.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven't standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don't torch the property.",
      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara released a bulletin in March that put the onus on companies to properly investigate reported smoke damage, saying they cannot deny such claims without investigating thoroughly, including paying for professional testing as warranted. But many residents have been left to fight for coverage anyway.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute that represents many major insurance companies, said it's hard to compare neighbors because every claim is unique due to each home\u2019s physical structure, actual damage and defined insurance coverage limits.",
      "\u201cIt can vary and insurance companies are sensitive to what the claim is,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cYou have to work with your insurance companies and be reasonable about what may have happened.\u201d",
      "Dave Jones, director of the Climate Risk Initiative at University of California, Berkeley, and former state insurance commissioner, said testing should be covered even though some insurance companies disagree.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable for people to have some kind of environmental test done so that their home is safe and their property is safe,\" Jones said. \"We\u2019re talking about very catastrophically high temperature fires where all sorts of materials are melted and some of them become toxic.\"",
      "The state's insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over how it handles smoke damage claims. A 2017 change to the FAIR Plan limited coverage to \u201cpermanent physical changes,\u201d meaning smoke damage must be visible or detectable without lab testing for claims to be approved. State officials said that threshold was too high and illegal, and ordered a change.",
      "Dylan Schaffer, an attorney leading a class action lawsuit challenging FAIR Plan\u2019s threshold, said he was surprised private carriers are disputing similar fire damage claims.",
      "\u201cThe damage is not due to smoke, the damage is contamination from fire,\u201d Schaffer said. \u201cThey make it complicated because it saves them money.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Altadena residents on the FAIR Plan say their claims are still being denied. Jones believes the debate will only end when lawmakers take action.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean declined to comment on the ongoing litigation and individual cases, but said the FAIR Plan pays all covered claims based on the adjusters\u2019 recommendations.",
      "\u201cOur policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage,\u201d McLean said.",
      "Lawton Potelle said the first inkling that her house might be toxic came after meeting with her AAA insurance adjuster in the days after the fire. Even though she had worn a mask, her chest still ached and her voice rasped, and she wondered whether her home was safe for her 11-year-old.",
      "Stephanie Wilcox said her toddler\u2019s pediatrician recommended testing their home. Her Farmers Insurance policy includes coverage for lead and asbestos in addition to her wildfire coverage, but after multiple denials, she paid out of pocket.",
      "\u201cAfter the initial inspection, (Farmers) had told us remediation would cost about $12,000 and that it would be habitable, like we could move back in tomorrow,\u201d she said. \"But now there\u2019s no way.\u201d",
      "She plans to ask for a new estimate including lead abatement and other costs, citing the results.",
      "Similarly, Zach Bailey asked in late January for contamination testing. The house he shares with his wife and toddler sits in an island of largely spared homes among blocks wiped out by the fire. After months of denials, State Farm agreed to pay for lead and asbestos testing because the remediation company cited federal worker safety regulations.",
      "It shouldn't have been that hard, he said.",
      "\u201cIt feels like the insurance companies should have a playbook at this point,\" he said. \u201cThey should have a process to keep people safe because this isn\u2019t the first disaster like this.\u201d",

      "While American consumers and markets wonder and worry about President Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again tariffs, Gulf coast shrimpers are cheering him on",
      "PALACIOS, Texas -- While American consumers and markets wonder and worry about President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs, there's one group cheering him as they hope he'll prop up their sinking business: Gulf coast shrimpers.",
      "American shrimpers have been hammered in recent years by cheap imports flooding the U.S. market and restaurants, driving down prices to the point that profits are razor thin or shrimpers are losing money and struggling to stay afloat.",
      "Tariffs, they hope, could level the playing field and help their businesses not just survive but thrive.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been tough the last several years that we\u2019ve tried to fight through this,\" said Reed Bowers, owner of Bowers Shrimp Farm in Palacios, Texas. Tough times meant difficult choices for many. \"Cutting people off, laying people off, or reduce hours or reduce wages ... whatever we can do to survive.\"",
      "Since 2021, the price of imported shrimp has dropped by more than $1.5 billion, according to the Southern Shrimpers Alliance trade association, causing the U.S. shrimp industry to lose nearly 50% of its market value.",
      "The shrimpers alliance complains that the overseas industry has benefitted from billions of dollars invested in shrimp aquaculture, cheap or even forced labor, use of antibiotics banned in the U.S., and few or no environment regulations.",
      "More than 90% of shrimp consumed in the U.S. is imported, according to the alliance.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a believer in free trade. I\u2019m a believer fair trade,\u201d Bowers said. \"So if you\u2019re gonna sell into the United States, I think it\u2019s very important to get the same rules and regulations that I have to have as a farmer here in the United States.\u201d",
      "Craig Wallis, owner of W&W Dock & Ice, has been in the business since 1975 and noted that back then shrimpers would run their trawlers 12 months a year.",
      "Not anymore. That's no longer affordable as Gulf shrimpers compete with cheaper product coming in from South America, China and India.",
      "Wallis says he's only able to run his shrimp boats about half the year, yet \u201cthe bills keep coming every month.\u201d",
      "\"We don\u2019t get any subsidies here. We don\u2019t need any help from the government. What we get for our product is what we have to make it on,\u201d he said.",
      "Wallis, who noted he voted for Trump, has watched the back-and-forth on tariffs in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know where the tariffs are going to be settled at,\" he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s definitely going to help.\"",
      "But Trump's tariffs will also force shrimpers to balance the higher costs of equipment, such as trawl cables, webbing, chains and shackles. Some of those items have recently been increasing in price, Wallis said.",
      "\"We got be careful that there\u2019s a good balance,\u201d he said.",
      "If the American shrimping industry collapses, Wallis sees a future where foreign trawlers are operating in the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump renamed the \u201c Gulf of America. \u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hanging on to have something when I retire,\u201d said Wallis, who is 72. \u201cIf it keeps going like it is, it\u2019s taken away from my retirement that I\u2019ve worked for all my life.\u201d",
      "Phan Tran's family used to be shrimpers but quit the boats around 25 years ago to open Tran's Family Restaurant, a place they literally built themselves.",
      "\u201cIt was just my dad, me and one welder,\u201d Tran said.",
      "Tran said he doesn't want to serve imported shrimp to his customers. He doesn't know what shortcuts foreign shrimper firms take.",
      "\u201cThe taste, the size, you could tell the texture of the shrimp, everything. ... Domestic shrimp versus imported shrimp, you could tell the difference,\u201d Tran said, adding he'll be buying straight from the day's catch at the dock, \u201cas long as we have the restaurant business.\u201d",
      "Tariffs will help keep the market fair for local shrimpers, Tran said.",
      "\u201cWe used to have a sign on our window here that says, \u2018friends don\u2019t let friends eat imported shrimp,\u2019\" Tran said. \u201cAnd a few people got a little offended by it, so we had to take it off. (But) that's a true statement that we stand by here.\u201d",
      "Bowers, the shrimp farm owner, hopes seafood tariffs have a positive ripple effect across the industry for American producers.",
      "\u201cI think the price of imported seafood is gonna come up,\" he said. \u201cAnd as that price comes up, it\u2019ll make our seafood, our shrimp, more affordable for everybody else.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to oversee an agency that manages a quarter-billion acres of public land has withdrawn her nomination",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Donald Trump's nominee to oversee an agency that manages a quarter-billion acres of public land has withdrawn her nomination following revelations that she criticized the Republican president in 2021 for inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "The withdrawal of Kathleen Sgamma to lead the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management was announced Thursday morning at the start of her confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.",
      "David Bernhardt, who served as interior secretary in Trump\u2019s first term, suggested on X that Sgamma\u2019s withdrawal was \u201cself-inflicted\u201d and he included a link to a website that posted her 2021 comments. Bernhardt indicated that people whose views don\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s should not seek political appointments in his administration.",
      "\u201cI am disgusted by the violence witnessed yesterday and President Trump\u2019s role in spreading misinformation that incited it,\u201d Sgamma said in the comments earlier reported by Documented, which describes itself as a watchdog journalism project.",
      "Sgamma confirmed her withdrawal on LinkedIn and said it was an honor to have been nominated.",
      "\u201cI remain committed to President Trump and his unleashing American energy agenda and ensuring multiple-use access for all,\u201d said Sgamma. Since 2006 she's been with the Denver-based Western Energy Alliance, an oil industry trade group, and has been a vocal critic of the energy policies of Democratic administrations.",
      "White House spokesperson Liz Huston said the administration looked forward to naming another nominee but did not offer a timeline.",
      "The longtime oil and gas industry representative appeared well-poised to carry out Trump's plans to roll back restrictions on energy development, including in Western states where the land bureau has vast holdings. The agency also oversees mining, grazing and recreation.",
      "Sgamma's withdrawal underscored the Trump administration's creation of a \u201cloyalty test\u201d to weed out subordinates who are out of step with him, said Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the left-leaning Center for Western Priorities.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the world we're in \u2014 if that\u2019s what happened \u2014 where being sane and acknowledging reality with the White House is enough to sink a nomination,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has been testing how far Republicans are willing to go in supporting his supercharged \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda. Few Republicans have criticized Trump after his sweeping pardons of supporters, including violent rioters, charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.",
      "Most congressional Republicans have played down the potential negative impact of Trump\u2019s actions, including widespread tariffs on U.S. allies, and have stressed the importance of uniting behind him.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management plays a central role in a long-running debate over the best use of government-owned lands, and its policies have swung sharply as control of the White House has shifted between Republicans and Democrats. Under President Joe Biden, a Democrat, it curbed oil drilling and coal mining on federal lands while expanding renewable power. The agency under Biden also moved to put conservation on more equal footing with oil drilling and other extractive industries in a bid to address climate change.",
      "Trump is reversing the land bureau's course yet again.",
      "On Thursday, officials announced that they will not comprehensively analyze environmental impacts from oil and gas leases on a combined 5,500 square miles (14,100 square kilometers) of bureau land in Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. The leases were sold to companies between 2015 and 2020 but have been tied up by legal challenges.",
      "Also this week, Trump signed an executive order aimed at boosting coal production. That will end the Biden administration's ban on new federal coal sales on bureau lands in Wyoming and Montana, the nation's largest coal fields.",
      "The land bureau had about 10,000 employees at the start of Trump\u2019s second term, but at least 800 employees have been laid off or resigned amid efforts by the Trump administration to downsize the federal workforce.",
      "It went four years without a confirmed director during Trump's first term. Trump moved the agency\u2019s headquarters to Colorado before it was returned to Washington, D.C., under Biden.",
      "Senate energy committee Chairman Mike Lee said he would work with the administration to find a new nominee for the bureau.",
      "\"Its work directly impacts millions of Americans \u2014 especially in the West \u2014 and its leadership matters,\" the Utah Republican said.",
      "Utah officials last year launched a legal effort to wrest control of Bureau of Land Management property from the federal government and put it under state control. They were turned down by the U.S. Supreme Court.",

      "WASHINGTON -- In the aftermath of this week's tariff whiplash, President Donald Trump is deciding exactly what he wants out of trade talks with as many as 75 nations in the coming weeks.",
      "Trump is also figuring out next steps with China. He upped his tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% after China placed retaliatory taxes of 84% on imports from the U.S. While his 90-day pause on other tariffs caused the stock market to rally on Wednesday, countries still face a baseline 10% import tax instead of the higher rates announced on April 2.",
      "\u201cThere will be a transition cost and transition problems,\u201d Trump said at Thursday's Cabinet meeting. \u201cBut in the end it\u2019s going to be a beautiful thing.\u201d",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, told Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox and Friends\" on Thursday that the administration already has \u201coffers on the table from more than 15 countries.\u201d",
      "Hassett said the next step will be determining exactly what Trump wants out of the negotiations.",
      "\u201cWe have a meeting today with all the top principals where we\u2019re going to present to the president a list of what we think his priorities might look like,\" Hassett said. \"And I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to, you know, have his own ideas about where to move things.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at where Trump's tariffs showdown stands:",
      "With $28.9 trillion in publicly held debt, the U.S. government can still be beholden to the investors who lend it money. Trump might be willing to run roughshod over political rivals, judges he dislikes and a host of political norms, but the bond market showed that it can temper his plans.",
      "Going into Wednesday, the interest rate on a 10-year U.S. Treasury note was increasing and approaching 4.5%. That meant the U.S. government was having a tough time finding possible buyers for its debt, as market participants were wondering if Trump's tariffs had caused foreign buyers to sour on the U.S. government. Higher interest rates for the government could trigger even higher mortgage rates and auto loans for consumers, among other problems.",
      "Trump on Wednesday said investors were getting \u201cyippy,\u201d but after his tariff pause he described the bond market as \u201cbeautiful.\u201d",
      "The S&P 500 stock index jumped 9.5% after the pause was announced. But reality crept back in Thursday and the S&P 500 slumped nearly 3.5% as interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose. Sure, Trump was no longer going to put a 20% tariff on goods from the European Union, a 24% tariff on Japan or 25% on South Korea. But those nations still have imports taxed at an elevated 10%, Trump's new baseline as trade talks begin. And tariffs went up against China, locking the world's two largest economies in a trade war.",
      "Plus, the trade war has expanded with China, and 25% tariffs still apply to imported autos, steel and aluminum. Imports from Canada and Mexico, the two largest U.S. trading partners, still face tariffs of as much as 25%. And Trump still plans tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.",
      "\u201cWhile we appreciate the pause, the reciprocal tariff of 10% still represents more than double the tariff on imports of leather footwear from countries like Vietnam and Cambodia,\u201d said Tom Florsheim, CEO of the Weyco Group, a footwear company. \u201cEven at this level, it means a significant cost increase that will impact consumers.\u201d",
      "Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers, the costs generally get passed along to consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimated Thursday that even with the pause, Trump's current tariff regime would pull down a household's average disposable income by $4,364.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said any trade agreements will be \u201cbespoke\u201d deals, rather than some overarching pact among a group of countries. Trump has laid out a series of grievances and goals regarding tariffs, but Canadian and European counterparts have said the actual asks from administration officials have been vague so far.",
      "Trump has said he wants to eliminate the $1.2 trillion trade deficit, which means he no longer wants the U.S. to import more goods than it exports to other nations. He also wants revenues from tariffs to offset his income tax cut plans. The president has also said he wants the tariffs to bring back factory jobs and raise workers\u2019 wages.",
      "Aides have said Trump wants other nations to scrap regulations and other policies, such as Europe's value-added taxes, that he deems to be a barrier to U.S. goods, an ask that would require other countries to change their laws. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said the goal is to get other nations to \u201crespect\u201d Trump.",
      "His goals might not necessarily be in line with what other nations want.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X that she's \u201cconsistently advocated for a zero-for-zero tariff agreement between the European Union and the United States.\u201d",
      "Lori Wallach, director of the Rethink Trade program at the American Economic Liberties Project, said Trump needs to be more publicly forthright about what he wants out of trade talks and tariffs.",
      "\u201cAbsent transparency about what is being demanded, we could end up with the worst of all outcomes \u2014 a bunch of bad special interest deals, all of the economic damage caused by tariff uncertainty and no trade rebalancing, U.S. manufacturing capacity or goods jobs,\u201d she said.",
      "The Trump administration views China as violating basic trade norms with how it subsidizes its manufacturers, takes intellectual property from its global competitors, suppresses wages for its workers and manipulates its currency.",
      "The White House clarified that the 125% tariffs that Trump announced Wednesday against China were actually 145%, once his previous 20% fentanyl tariffs were included.",
      "Census Bureau data show the U.S. ran a $295 billion trade deficit last year with China. Because U.S. consumers and businesses are such a major customer of Chinese manufacturers, Bessent has said that gives the U.S. an edge in terms of inflicting pain on that nation's economy through tariffs. Of course, China has also spent several years preparing for a trade war.",
      "Trump at his Cabinet meeting expressed hope that he could get an agreement with China, though he didn't offer any specifics on what he was seeking.",
      "\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see what happens with China,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would love to be able to work a deal.\u201d",
      "Wendong Zhang, an economist at Cornell University, said the Chinese economy might suffer a steeper hit to its gross domestic product than the U.S., but it's \u201clikely to stick to its guns\u201d due to internal public support and the ability to increase consumption domestically on goods that might no longer be going to the U.S.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump will need to deal with voters who might be frustrated over the higher price of electronics and other goods resulting from the trade wars.",
      "\u201cMany products that the U.S. imports are predominantly from China: smartphones (73%), laptops (78%), video game consoles (87%), toys (77%), and also antibiotics for U.S. livestock production,\" Zhang said in an email. \u201cResourcing from other countries will take time and result in much higher costs.\u201d",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- China is reaching out to other nations as the U.S. layers on more tariffs, in what appears to be an attempt by Beijing to form a united front to compel Washington to retreat. Days into the effort, it's meeting only partial success from countries unwilling to ally with the main target of President Donald Trump's trade war.",
      "Facing the cratering of global markets, Trump on Wednesday backed off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days, saying countries were lining up to negotiate more favorable conditions.",
      "China has refused to seek talks, saying the U.S. was insincere and that it will \u201cfight to the end\u201d in a tariff war, prompting Trump to further jack up the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125%. China has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. goods of 84%, which took effect Thursday.",
      "Trump's move was seemingly an attempt to narrow what had been an unprecedented trade war between the U.S. and most of the world to a showdown between the U.S. and China.",
      "China has thus far focused on Europe, with a phone call between Premier Li Qiang and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen \u201csending a positive message to the outside world.\u201d The two are each other's largest trading partners.",

      "Wang said the tariffs \u201cseriously infringe upon the legitimate interests of all countries, seriously violate WTO rules, seriously damage the rules-based multilateral trading system, and seriously impact the stability of the global economic order,\u201d Xinhua said.",

China has \u201calready made a full evaluation and is prepared to deal with all kinds of uncertainties, and will introduce incremental policies according to the needs of the situation,\u201d Xinhua quoted Li as saying.",

      "Yet, Southeast Asian nations such as Vietnam and Cambodia find themselves in a particular bind. They benefited when factories moved to their countries from China due to rising costs. They are being hit by punishing tariffs but have few buyers outside the U.S. and are already operating on razor-thin margins.",
      "Trump had previously denied contemplating a pause, but the drama over his tariffs will continue as the administration prepares to engage in country-by-country negotiations. Meanwhile, tariffs will be 10% for the countries where the larger ones were paused.",

      "House Speaker Mike Johnson is vowing to try again to pass the Republican budget framework after abruptly postponing Wednesday night's vote",
      "WASHINGTON -- After abruptly halting votes, House Speaker Mike Johnson vowed to try again Thursday to approve a Republican budget framework, having worked into the night to satisfy GOP holdouts who refused to advance trillions of dollars in tax breaks without deeper spending cuts.",
      "Even a hefty push from President Donald Trump couldn't heave the package to approval. Johnson was forced to abandon Wednesday's scheduled action as the Republican hardliners left him without enough support, and risked upending what the president calls the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\" which is central to his agenda of tax cuts, mass deportations and a smaller federal government.",
      "\u201cThe president is very anxious for us to get this done,\u201d Johnson, R-La., said as he left a late-night meeting with the GOP lawmakers. He said he expects votes on Thursday.",
      "Pushing the budget framework forward would log another milestone for Johnson, who can only lose a few detractors from his slim majority. A failed vote, particularly as the economy was convulsing over Trump\u2019s trade wars, would be a major setback for the Republican agenda in Washington.",
      "\u201cStop grandstanding!\u201d Trump had admonished Republicans during a black-tie fundraising dinner at the National Building Museum earlier in the week.",
      "Trump told the Republicans, \"Close your eyes and get there.\u201d",
      "But by Wednesday afternoon, the outcome was in flux. At least a dozen conservative Republicans, if not more, stood firmly against the plan. Several of them, including members of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, made the unusual move of walking across the Capitol to meet privately with Senate GOP leaders to insist on deeper cuts.",
      "As night fell, Johnson pulled a group of Republicans into a private meeting room as House proceedings came to a standstill. They stayed into the night hashing out alternatives.",
      "Johnson said he spoke with Trump for about five minutes while the GOP meeting was taking place. The GOP speaker said they're trying to figure out the minimal number of cuts and savings \u201cthat will satisfy everyone.\u201d",
      "Options include amending the Senate bill or having a conference committee work out the differences, among others. \"There\u2019s a few different ideas on the table,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "\u201cWe want everybody to have a high degree of comfort about what is happening here, and we have a small subset of members who weren\u2019t totally satisfied with the product as it stands,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "But House GOP conservatives, including several of those who met personally with Trump at the White House this week, remained concerned that the Senate GOP's blueprint, approved last weekend, does not slash spending to the level they believe is necessary to help prevent soaring deficits.",
      "\u201cThe Math Does Not Add Up,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, posted on social media. He said he would not support it.",
      "Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., the chair of the Freedom Caucus, led others to met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and other top Senate Republicans.",
      "\u201cAll we can do is make sure that they understand where we\u2019re coming from and how close we want to work with them to get to the final product,\u201d Thune said afterward.",
      "But the Senate GOP leader panned the idea of the House sending back an amended version, which would require another potential all-night voting session like the one senators endured last weekend. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that \u2014 another vote-a-rama, that drags it on indefinitely,\u201d Thune said.",
      "The House and Senate are still at the beginning phase of a process that will take weeks, if not months, as they turn their budget resolutions into legislative text \u2014 a final product with more votes ahead later this spring or summer.",
      "Democrats, in the minority, do not have enough votes to stop the package, but have warned against it.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the Republicans' budget plan is reckless and callous as it proposes slashing budgets to give tax breaks to the wealthy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to make it clear,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cHands off everyday Americans struggling to make ends meet.\u201d",
      "Central to the budget framework is the Republican effort to preserve the tax breaks approved in 2017, during Trump's first term, while potentially adding the new ones he promised on the campaign trail. That includes no taxes on tipped wages, Social Security income and others, ballooning the price tag to some $7 trillion over the decade.",
      "The package also allows for budget increases with some $175 billion to pay for Trump's mass deportation operation and as much for the Defense Department to bolster military spending.",
      "It all would be partly paid for with steep cuts to domestic programs, including health care, as part of the $2 trillion in reductions outlined in the House GOP version of the package, though several GOP senators have signaled they are not willing to go that far.",
      "To clip costs, the Senate is using an unusual accounting method that does not count the costs of preserving the 2017 tax cuts, some $4.5 trillion, as new spending, another factor that is enraging the House conservatives.",
      "Two Republican senators voted against their package during an overnight weekend session \u2014 Maine Sen. Susan Collins objected to steep cuts to Medicaid in the House's framework, while Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul argued the whole package relied on \u201cfishy\u201d math that would add to the debt.",
      "The package would also boost the nation's debt limit to allow more borrowing to pay the bills. Trump had wanted lawmakers to take the politically difficult issue off the table. With debt now at $36 trillion, the Treasury Department has said it will run out of funds by August.",
      "But the House and Senate need to resolve their differences on the debt limit, as well. The House GOP raises the debt limit by $4 trillion, but the Senate GOP boosted it to $5 trillion so Congress would not have to revisit the issue again until after the fall 2026 midterm election.",
      "With Trump's trade wars hovering over the debate, House Republicans tucked a provision into a procedural vote that would prevent House action \u2014 as the Senate has taken \u2014 to disapprove of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, widely seen as the front-runner in a presidential by-election triggered by the removal of Yoon Suk Yeol last week, announced his presidential bid Thursday, vowing to heal a starkly divided nation through economic growth.",
      "Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, led the liberal Democratic Party\u2019s campaign to oust the former president over his December declaration of martial law.",
      "Lee recently stepped down as the party\u2019s chairman to focus on campaigning for the June 3 election. He is considered the clear front-runner in party's primary. Kim Dong-yeon, the Democratic governor of Gyeonggi province and a longtime financial policymaker, also told reporters Wednesday that he intends to run for president.",
      "Yoon\u2019s downfall has left the conservative People Power Party in disarray, with roughly 10 politicians expected to seek the nomination, reflecting a split between Yoon loyalists, who still control the party\u2019s leadership, and reformists calling for a fresh start.",
      "In a video message, Lee said that Yoon\u2019s martial law saga exposed the country\u2019s deep divisions and social conflicts, and argued that the root cause was a widening rich-poor gap. He promised aggressive government spending to jolt economic growth and ease income polarization.",
      "\u201cWe have more than we did in the past, but wealth is too concentrated in certain areas,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWith economic growth rates declining worldwide, it has become difficult to maintain and develop an economy solely on the strength of the private sector. However, with government-led talent development and extensive investments in technological research and development, we can revive the economy.\u201d",
      "Lee said it was crucial to maintain a robust alliance with the United States and to pursue three-way cooperation with Japan, but he stressed that South Korea\u2019s national interest should come first in \u201cevery decision.\u201d",
      "Lee, who has served as a lawmaker, provincial governor and city mayor, is adored by supporters for his outspoken style and has long positioned himself as an anti-elitist. His critics view him as a populist who stokes division and demonizes conservative opponents while failing to offer realistic funding plans to achieve his ambitious goals.",
      "Kweon Seong-dong, PPP floor leader and a staunch Yoon loyalist, said that if Lee becomes president, he will \u201cruthlessly wield the sword of dogmatism and retribution\u201d and further deepen the country\u2019s divisions.",
      "Lee also has his own set of legal troubles, facing five different trials for corruption and other criminal charges.",
      "Earlier this month, the Constitutional Court upheld Yoon\u2019s impeachment by the legislature and formally removed him from office over the martial law decree, triggering a presidential by-election within 60 days. The next president will serve a full 5-year term.",
      "Former PPP leader Han Dong-hoon, head of the party\u2019s anti-Yoon faction, announced his presidential bid Thursday, positioning himself as a conservative who opposed martial law and appealing to centrist voters to stop the inauguration of a populist \u201cmonster government\u201d led by Lee. Among the conservatives\u2019 presidential hopefuls, former Labor Minister Kim Moon Soo is considered to be the most pro-Yoon.",
      "Kim, Daegu Mayor Hong Joon-pyo and senior PPP lawmaker Ahn Cheol-soo \u2014 a former computer software entrepreneur who finished third in the 2017 presidential vote \u2014 have declared their intentions to run for president. Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon is expected to enter the race later.",

    "story": [
      "The 29 vehicles in a Rolls-Royce and Bentley museum outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, are getting the best of care in their golden years",
      "MECHANICSBURG, Pa. -- Mike Fowler had been faintly aware that a museum of Rolls-Royce and Bentley vehicles existed near his boyhood home in the suburbs of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, but the car enthusiast didn't expect the experience he got when he started volunteering there.",
      "Fowler had oil on his hands within a half-hour of his first volunteer session at the Rolls-Royce and Bentley Museum. More than a year later, he keeps a list on his phone with notes about cars in the collection to help him get them started properly or disconnect their batteries.",
      "Fowler is part of a group of about 50 volunteers who gather twice a month at the museum to help out, including cleaning, maintaining and driving the fleet of customized iconic vehicles, many designed to be driven by a chauffeur. For many volunteers, it\u2019s an opportunity to experience a life few people can afford.",
      "\u201cYou take it out on the road and you are transported to a different time, a different mentality,\u201d said Fowler, a 28-year-old Camp Hill resident.",
      "Newcomers are first paired with a more experienced volunteer for about a year and must pass the museum\u2019s driving school. They start with the most modern vehicles, which have automatic transmissions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very protective of the collection. We\u2019re its caretakers, and we take it very seriously. So you can\u2019t just come in off the street and start driving,\u201d said Sarah Holibaugh, the museum\u2019s head librarian and archivist. \u201cBut it should be that way.\u201d",
      "The 29 antique and collectible Rolls-Royce and Bentley automobiles that date as far back as the late 1920s are the central attraction of the largely overlooked and seldom visited museum, which is easy to miss among the surrounding miles of farm fields and stretch of nondescript industrial buildings just outside Mechanicsburg. The museum, owned by the Rolls-Royce Foundation, includes a showroom, maintenance area and a third room being converted into a library and reading room.",
      "\u201cI often wonder if the homes around here know the foundation exists,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cOr if they always just wonder, \u2018Why do we see these vintage Rolls-Royce and Bentleys roaming around from time to time?\u2019\"",
      "The museum has its roots in nearby Harrisburg, where Rolls-Royce put an owners' club in the 1960s, located between large dealerships in New York and Washington. After Hurricane Agnes devasted that location in 1972, a businessman donated the Mechanicsburg property for a new facility. The 6,000-person owners' club, with members in 26 countries and a headquarters in the same complex, is a separate entity but works closely with the museum.",
      "Though admission is just $5, the museum launched in 2004 gets only about 1,000 visitors a year. It typically draws members of car clubs, groups of seniors and students on school field trips, with visits that have to be scheduled in advance.",
      "It also has rented out its cars for films and similar uses. The museum's 1961 Rolls-Royce Phantom V was in last year\u2019s Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet biopic about Bob Dylan, \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d and a 1959 Silver Cloud I from the collection appeared in Season 4 of the series \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d",
      "Volunteers also help preserve and digitize the museum's archive of ownership and service records for North America, which span from 1907 until 2004, shortly after Rolls-Royce and Bentley were acquired by BMW and Volkswagen, respectively. Records for cars made for the European market are available through the Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts\u2019 Club in the United Kingdom.",
      "The North American records, which are available for a fee and produce the foundation's biggest revenue stream, have helped prove cars outside of their collection were once owned by famed director Alfred Hitchcock, actor Zsa Zsa Gabor and hockey great Wayne Gretzky.",
      "Foundation records have also debunked claims about purported prior ownership, including a Rolls-Royce vehicle thought to have been owned by country singer Hank Williams Jr.",
      "\u201cWe were able to absolutely prove that it was not owned by him,\u201d recalled volunteer Randy Churchill, a Boiling Springs man now retired from a marketing career. \u201cThey just thought they had a million-dollar gold mine on their hands.\u201d",
      "Vehicles in the museum\u2019s collection range in value from about $30,000 to about $120,000. A whiskey delivery truck appraised at $320,000 has been donated and will soon be on display.",
      "Many of the cars Rolls-Royce has built are still on the road and used models can be surprisingly cheap. But maintaining an older Rolls, with its customized features and expensive parts, can be pricey, noted volunteer Ron Deguffroy, a retired psychologist from Chambersburg.",
      "\u201cThe most expensive Rolls-Royce you will buy,\" he said, \u201cis a cheap one.\u201d",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A new executive order from President Donald Trump that's part of his effort to invigorate energy production raises the possibility that his Department of Justice will go to court against state climate change laws aimed at slashing planet-warming greenhouse gas pollution from fossil fuels.",
      "Trump\u2019s order, signed Tuesday, comes as U.S. electricity demand ramps up to meet the growth of artificial intelligence and cloud computing applications, as well as federal efforts to expand high-tech manufacturing. It also coincides with \u201cclimate superfund\u201d legislation gaining traction in various states.",
      "Trump has declared a \u201c national energy emergency \" and ordered his attorney general to take action against states that may be illegally overreaching their authority in how they regulate energy development.",
      "\u201cAmerican energy dominance is threatened when State and local governments seek to regulate energy beyond their constitutional or statutory authorities,\u201d Trump said in the order.",
      "He said the attorney general should focus on state laws targeting climate change, a broad order that unmistakably puts liberal states in the crosshairs of Trump's Department of Justice.",
      "Michael Gerrard, director of the Columbia University\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said it would be an \u201cextraordinarily bold move\u201d for the federal government to go to court to try to overturn a state climate law.",
      "Gerrard said the quickest path for Trump's Department of Justice is to try to join ongoing lawsuits where courts are deciding whether states or cities are exceeding their authority by trying to force the fossil fuel industry to pay for the cost of damages from climate change.",
      "Democratic governors vowed to keep fighting climate change.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom accused Trump of \u201cturning back the clock\u201d on the climate and said his state's efforts to reduce pollution \u201cwon\u2019t be derailed by a glorified press release masquerading as an executive order.\u201d",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, cochairs of the U.S. Climate Alliance, which includes 22 governors, said they \u201cwill keep advancing solutions to the climate crisis.\"",
      "Vermont and New York are currently fighting challenges in federal courts to climate superfund laws passed last year. Trump suggested the laws \u201cextort\u201d payments from energy companies and \u201cthreaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security.\u201d",
      "Both are modeled on the 45-year-old federal superfund law, which taxed petroleum and chemical companies to pay to clean up of sites polluted by toxic waste. In similar fashion, the state climate laws are designed to force major fossil fuel companies to pay into state-based funds based on their past greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "Several other Democratic-controlled states, including New Jersey, Massachusetts, Oregon and California, are considering similar measures.",
      "The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and natural gas industries, applauded Trump\u2019s order that it said would \u201cprotect American energy from so-called \u2018climate superfunds.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cDirecting the Department of Justice to address this state overreach will help restore the rule of law and ensure activist-driven campaigns do not stand in the way of ensuring the nation has access to an affordable and reliable energy supply,\" it said.",
      "The American Petroleum Institute, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, filed the lawsuit against Vermont. The lawsuit against New York was filed by West Virginia, along with several coal, gas and oil interests and 21 other mostly Republican-led states, including Texas, Ohio and Georgia.",
      "Make Polluters Pay, a coalition of consumer and anti-fossil fuel groups, vowed to fight Trump's order and accused fossil fuel billionaires of convincing Trump to launch an assault on states.",
      "The order, it said, demonstrates the \u201ccorporate capture of government\u201d and \u201cweaponizes the Justice Department against states that dare to make polluters pay for climate damage.\u201d",
      "Separately, the Department of Justice could join lawsuits in defense of fossil fuel industries being sued, Gerrard said.",
      "Those lawsuits include ones filed by Honolulu, Hawaii, and dozens of cities and states seeking billions of dollars in damages from things like wildfires, rising sea levels and severe storms.",
      "In the last three months, the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to get involved in a couple climate-themed lawsuits.",
      "One was brought by oil and gas companies asking it to block Honolulu's lawsuit. Another was brought by Alabama and Republican attorneys general in 18 other states aimed at blocking lawsuits against the oil and gas industry from Democratic-led states, including California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey and Rhode Island.",
      "Trump\u2019s order set off talk in state Capitols around the U.S.",
      "That includes Pennsylvania, where the governor is contesting a court challenge to a regulation that would make it the first major fossil fuel-producing state to force power plant owners pay for greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "John Quigley, a former Pennsylvania environmental protection secretary and a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, wondered if the Department of Justice would begin challenging all sorts of state water and air pollution laws.",
      "\u201cThis kind of an order knows no bounds,\" Quigley said. \"It's hard to say where this could end up.\u201d",

      "Inflation likely declined last month as the cost of energy, used cars and hotel rooms may have fallen, though President Donald Trump\u2019s remaining tariffs could lift prices soon",
      "WASHINGTON -- Inflation likely declined last month as the cost of energy, used cars and hotel rooms may have fallen, though President Donald Trump's remaining tariffs could lift prices soon.",
      "Consumer prices probably rose 2.6% in March from a year ago, the Labor Department is expected to report Thursday, according to economists' projections compiled by FactSet. That would be down from February's yearly gain of 2.8%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices are expected to have risen 3%, down from 3.1% in February.",
      "The projected figures, if accurate, would suggest inflation is starting to cool again after remaining elevated for most of the fall and winter. Core inflation was stuck at 3.3% for five months before declining in February.",
      "Still, inflation remains above the 2% target set by the inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve. And on a monthly basis, core prices are forecast to rise 0.3% in March. If sustained, price increases at that pace would easily top the Fed's target. Overall prices are expected to tick up just 0.1% in March, however. Economists pay closer attention to the core figures because they provide a better guide to where inflation is headed.",
      "Most economists had forecast higher inflation this year as a result of the sweeping tariffs on 60 nations that President Donald Trump announced last week. Yet on Wednesday, Trump paused those duties for 90 days. A universal tariff of 10% remains in place, as well as 25% duties on steel, aluminum, cars and many items from Canada and Mexico.",
      "And import taxes on China have been ramped up to 125%, after China retaliated against Trump's earlier decisions to place large duties on imports from China.",
      "Even with the pause, many companies are still uncertain where trade policy will go next. Trump has also said that duties on pharmaceutical imports will be imposed.",
      "Consumers will likely see some prices rise because of the existing duties, including the massive tariffs on China. The United States imports more than $60 billion of iPhones and other mobile phones every year from China, as well as massive amounts of clothes, shoes and toys.",
      "Many U.S. companies will likely shift production out of China, a process that had already started during Trump's first term when he slapped duties on some of its exports. Still, China remains the Unite States' third-largest trading partner.",
      "Shifting supply chains out of China, however, will likely take time and come with its own costs, which could raise prices for U.S. consumers in the coming months.",
      "Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank was likely to keep its key interest rate unchanged at about 4.3% as it waited to see how Trump's policies impacted the economy. Trump called for the Fed to cut rates on Friday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us,\u201d Powell said. \u201cAnd that just seems like the right thing to do in this period of uncertainty.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump delivered another jarring reversal in American trade policy Wednesday, suspending for 90 days import taxes he\u2019d imposed barely 13 hours earlier on dozens of countries while escalating his trade war with China",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump delivered another jarring reversal in American trade policy Wednesday, suspending for 90 days import taxes he\u2019d imposed barely 13 hours earlier on dozens of countries while escalating his trade war with China. The moves triggered a powerful stock market rally on Wall Street but left businesses, investors and America\u2019s trading partners bewildered about what the president is attempting to achieve.",
      "The U-turn came after the sweeping global tariffs Trump announced last week set off a four-day route in global financial markets, paralyzed businesses and raised fears the U.S. and world economies would tumble into recession.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried to characterize the sudden change in policy as part of a grand negotiating strategy. But to those outside the Trump administration, it looked like a cave-in to market pressure and to growing fears that the president\u2019s impetuous use of import taxes -- tariffs -- would cause massive collateral economic damage.",
      "\u201cOther countries will welcome the 90-day stay of execution \u2014 if it lasts \u2014 but the whiplash from constant zig-zags creates more of the uncertainty that businesses and governments hate,\u201d said Daniel Russel, vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cThe Administration\u2019s blunt-force tactics have rattled allies, who see the sudden reversal as damage control following the market meltdown, rather than a pivot to respectful, balanced negotiations.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump\u2019s turnaround Wednesday capped a wild week in U.S. trade policy. On Wednesday April 2 \u2014 which Trump labeled \u201cLiberation Day\u2019\u2019 \u2014 the president announced plans to impose tariffs on almost every country on earth, upending the world trading system. The first of his new tariffs -\u2013 a 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 tax on imports from most countries \u2013 went into effect Saturday.",
      "At midnight Wednesday, he upped the ante by slapping what he called \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 taxes on countries he accused of unfair trading practices and adding to U.S. trade deficits. Those are the tariffs he suspended for 90 days, saying the pause would give countries time to negotiate with him and his trade team.",
      "There was one exception to the reprieve: He raised the tariff on Chinese imports to a staggering 125%, punishing Beijing for announcing retaliatory tariffs on the United States. Meanwhile, the 10% baseline tariffs \u2013 a substantial act of protectionism in their own right \u2013 remain in place.",
      "Trump\u2019s ever-changing trade war tactics \u2014 which include earlier levies on cars, steel and aluminum, and Mexico and Canada \u2014 have already done damage, forcing dazed companies to delay or cancel plans as they tried to figure out what Trump was doing and how they should respond.",
      "Some companies temporarily laid off workers after Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs were announced, while there were signs that many firms held off on hiring amid the widespread uncertainty the tariffs created.",
      "Carmaker Stellantis temporarily cut 900 jobs at factories in Michigan and Indiana after production was halted at two plants in Canada and Mexico in the wake of Trump's 25% duties on imported cars.",
      "And Cleveland-Cliffs laid off 1,200 workers at a factory in Michigan and an iron ore mine in Minnesota in response to a drop in demand from auto companies. Cleveland-Cliffs said it would resume production at the two facilities once auto production returned to the U.S.",
      "Minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s March 18-19 meeting, released Wednesday, showed that many of its policymakers said that their business contacts \u201creported pausing hiring decisions because of elevated policy uncertainty.\"",
      "And Delta Air Lines said earlier Wednesday that demand for domestic leisure trips and corporate travel has stalled because of the uncertainty around global trade. In a conference call with investors, the company said it was cutting capacity. It also declined to provide a full-year financial forecast.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s hard to know how this is going to play out, given that this is somewhat self-imposed,\u201d Delta CEO Ed Bastian said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that sanity will prevail and we\u2019ll move through this period of time on the global trade front relatively quickly.\u201d",
      "Businesses have sought greater clarity around Trump's ultimate tariff policies for weeks. It's not clear that the 90-day pause has reduced their uncertainty.",
      "Jeff Jaisli, CEO of the New Jersey-based importer/exporter Jagro, said Trump\u2019s Truth Social post on Wednesday had made things \u201ceven worse\u2019\u2019 and more confusing. He was trying to figure out which tariffs applied to which countries.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re scrambling to find correct information and procedures for entries we\u2019re processing NOW in real time,\u2019\u2019 he said by email. He could find no guidance on the websites of the White House or the Customs and Border Protection agency, which collects tariffs. Earlier, Jaisli called Trump's tariffs \"a grenade that was thrown into the room that\u2019s going to cause chaos.''",
      "Trump's tariffs have set off a tit-for-tat trade war with China, the world's second-biggest economy. Even before Trump upped his taxes on China to 125%, the Chinese had set their own tariffs on the United States at 84%.",
      "The World Trade Organization's director-general, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, warned that the rising tension could reduce U.S.-China merchandise trade by 80% and \"severely damage the global economic outlook.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf particular concern is the potential fragmentation of global trade along geopolitical lines,\u201d she wrote in a statement late Wednesday. \u201cA division of the global economy into two blocs could lead to a long-term reduction in global real GDP by nearly 7%.\u201d",
      "Citing WTO projections, she warned the negative effects could ripple through to other economies, especially developing ones. She urged countries to ensure an open global trading system and resolve differences through cooperation.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. companies struggled to figure out how to respond to huge levies on Chinese products they'd come to rely on.",
      "Jessica Bettencourt is CEO of Klem\u2019s, a third-generation store in Spencer, Massachusetts that sells everything from lawn and garden items to workwear and gifts. She said that the escalation of tariffs from China have made her stop ordering any new fourth-quarter product that is holiday, gifts or toys. She is also reconsidering any fall apparel and footwear orders that aren\u2019t already placed.",
      "\u201cThe worst thing is uncertainty and we have massive uncertainty,\u201d said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, a global marketing and communications company. \u201cNo one can make any moves. Everybody is trying to save as much cash and defer any unnecessary expense. People are getting laid off. Orders are getting cancelled. Expansion plans are being put on hold.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is reversing course on its requirement for all staffers to report to the office",
      "WASHINGTON -- Weeks after ordering all Food and Drug Administration employees back into the office, the agency is reversing course, allowing some of its most prized staffers to work remotely amid worries that recent layoffs and resignations could jeopardize basic functions, like approving new medicines.",
      "An internal email obtained by The Associated Press states that FDA leadership are \u201callowing review staff and supervisors to resume telework\u201d at least two days a week. The policy shift was confirmed by three FDA staffers who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency matters.",
      "The message was sent Tuesday to some of the FDA\u2019s hundreds of drug reviewers. Staffers said a similar policy was communicated to reviewers who handle vaccines, biotech drugs, medical devices and tobacco products\u2014 although not always in writing.",
      "It\u2019s the latest example of the Trump administration\u2019s chaotic approach to overhauling the federal health workforce, which has included firings, a scramble to rehire some employees, and then additional layoffs last week of an estimated 3,400 staffers, or more than 15% of the agency\u2019s workforce. When FDA employees were called back to the agency's Maryland headquarters last month they confronted overflowing parking lots, crowded offices and broken or missing supplies.",
      "A spokeswoman for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the administration is returning to \u201cpre-COVID telework arrangements for reviewers, whose read and write work output is tracked in 15-minute increments to ensure productivity and accountability.\u201d",
      "While many agencies switched to telework during the pandemic, the FDA began embracing the practice nearly two decades earlier. The flexibility was seen as a competitive perk for recruiting employees who can often earn more working in industry.",
      "Last week's cuts included entire offices focusing on FDA policy and regulations, most of the agency\u2019s communication staff and teams that support food inspectors and investigators. Senior officials overseeing tobacco, new drugs, vaccines and other products have also been dismissed or forced to resign. Staffers have described rank-and-file employees \u201cpouring\u201d out of the agency.",
      "Former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler called the cuts \"devastating, haphazard, thoughtless and chaotic\" during a House hearing on Wednesday.",
      "When Kennedy announced plans to eliminate 10,000 staffers across the federal health workforce, he noted that FDA medical reviewers and safety inspectors wouldn't be impacted.",
      "In February, HHS was forced to recall some probationary employees who were fired, including hundreds of medical reviewers at FDA, whose salaries are largely funded by industry fees, not federal dollars.",
      "But last week\u2019s cuts combined with resignations and retirements have raised a new threat: that FDA funding could fall so low that it short circuits a long-standing system in which companies help fund much of the agency's operations.",
      "Nearly half the FDA's nearly $7 billion budget comes from fees collected from drug, device and tobacco companies. The agency uses the money to hire thousands of extra staffers to quickly and efficiently review new products. For example, about 70% of the FDA\u2019s drug program is financed by user-fee agreements, which must be reauthorized by Congress every five years.",
      "But the agreements stipulate that if FDA\u2019s federal funding falls below set levels, companies are no longer required to pay fees and, in some cases, can claw back their money. The threshold requirements are designed to ensure Congress continues funding FDA, rather than relying entirely on the private sector.",
      "FDA and industry groups are supposed to begin negotiations later this year to renew several user-fee agreements, including those for drugs and devices.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the agency nor regulated industry can afford for \u2018user fees\u2019 not to be reauthorized,\u201d said Michael Gaba, an attorney who advises FDA-regulated companies.",
      "Whatever the reasoning behind the telework shift, former government officials say it\u2019s a sign that recently confirmed FDA Commissioner Marty Makary is trying to retain and rebuild staffing and resources. Makary made his first appearance at FDA's headquarters last Wednesday, one day after the mass layoffs. According to the memo obtained by the AP, Makary signed off on the return to telework.",
      "\u201cDr. Makary needs to rebuild teams and restart the engine of productivity lost to weeks of job insecurity, uncertainty and shortages of team members,\u201d said Steven Grossman, a former HHS official. \u201cTurning commuting time back into work time is a great first step in achieving both.\u201d",

      "The two-time Masters champion's title defense took some unusual detours into the flora surrounding Augusta National's ryegrass fairways and bentgrass greens Friday, and if he hopes to win a third green jacket Sunday, he'll have to rally from another unfamiliar spot \u2014 three shots outside the lead.",
      "Scheffler led by five shots at the halfway point in 2022 and won by three. Last year, he was tied for the lead after the second round and won by four \u2014 part of a nine-win season that included a gold medal at the Paris Olympics.",
      "This time, he's at 5-under 139 and tied for fifth through 36 holes. Justin Rose was 8 under, with Bryson DeChambeau and Rory McIlroy also ahead of the defending champ.",
      "Over his first 24 holes of this Masters, Scheffler played the sort of golf that makes even McIlroy jealous \u2014 bogey- and drama-free. Then he began to wobble, with three bogeys in a five-hole stretch.",
      "And for a few seconds, it looked like he'd made a mess of the par-3 12th. His approach sailed well beyond the front left hole location and landed on an upslope covered by blooming azaleas \u2014 but the bushes spat out the ball, leaving a manageable chip.",
      "From there, Scheffler's elite short game took over. He chipped in for an improbable birdie that got him back under par for the day.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re playing for the wind to be into and it turns around and goes straight down, I mean, it\u2019s very challenging,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI was fortunate to see the ball come out of the bushes there and was able to take advantage of the break.\u201d",
      "The excitement wasn't over as the wind started gusting and temperatures cooled over his final six holes. He birdied Nos. 14 and 17 but had a three-putt bogey on the par-3 16th.",
      "On the 18th, he sent his drive left, where it settled under a magnolia, and Scheffler addressed the ball from his knees before asking for a rules official and sitting down in the pine straw. He ultimately punched out to the fairway, sent his third shot over the green and got up and down for bogey.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite challenging and you get winds like that. You\u2019ve really got to manage your expectations, manage yourself around the course,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I did a good job of that. Other times today, maybe not so good.\u201d",
      "No fan favorite when he won his first Masters, Scheffler has grown in the patrons' esteem since. During his nearly two years as the world's top-ranked player, he has let his guard down a bit, showing more of his dry, sarcastic sense of humor. But mostly, fans admire his incredible shot-making.",
      "On Friday afternoon, even as McIlroy and DeChambeau moved up the leaderboard ahead of him, spectators crowded the tee boxes and marveled at Scheffler's perfectly struck approaches to the par-3 fourth and sixth holes, the second of those leading to birdie.",
      "He\u2019s seeking to become the first to win back-to-back Masters since Tiger Woods in 2002 and the second ever to win three of four. Jack Nicklaus did it in 1963, \u201965 and \u201966.",
      "Eight players have won three or more green jackets: Nicklaus has six, Woods has five, and Phil Mickelson, Nick Faldo, Gary Player, Arnold Palmer, Sam Snead and Jimmy Demaret have three each. At 28, Scheffler would also become the only player under 30 with three major titles.",
      "This is Scheffler\u2019s first Masters as a dad, with 11-month-old Bennett having joined him for Wednesday\u2019s Par 3 Contest, wearing a white caddie jumpsuit.",
      "He still has a chance for another memorable moment with his son at the 18th hole Sunday.",

      "\u201cIt was a very special last two days for me,\u201d Langer said afterward, \"even starting off walking to the first tee yesterday, I got a standing ovation and the people really, you know, applauded. I almost teared up and almost started crying right there, and I said, \u2018Come on, get it together, you\u2019ve got some golf to play.\u2019",
      "\"It kind of kept going. There were lots of standing ovations throughout the golf course in various spots. Today coming up 18 was mixed emotions because I was still inside the cut line, and even when I made bogey, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019m totally out of there.\"",
      "It wasn't until the last players on the course finished their rounds a couple of hours later that it became official.",
      "Langer's competitive career at the Masters was over.",
      "\u201cThere were lots of emotions flooding through my mind the last two days as I was walking down the fairways,\u201d he said. \"I saw my wife, I saw my four kids, and I saw two of my grandkids came out and supported me, and friends from Germany, and family from Germany. Just even friends from all over the world, literally, were walking a few holes with me. It meant a great deal.",
      "\u201cI just have so many wonderful memories of playing this golf course. I fell in love with it immediately when I played my first round here, and was fortunate to win twice, and come back here for many, many years. Very special.\u201d",
      "Twenty-year-old Noah Kent had the best vantage point on the property to watch Langer's final round. The runner-up at the U.S. Amateur, Kent played with him and Will Zalatoris on the warm, sunny day at Augusta National.",
      "\u201cYeah, it was really cool,\" Kent said. \"He\u2019s an unbelievable man. Unbelievable player.\u201d",
      "A few minutes after Langer finished, the 65-year-old Couples came to the 18th with the cut in mind. He opened with 71, making him the second-oldest player behind Tom Watson to shoot a subpar round at the Masters. But back-to-back bogeys on Friday left the '92 champion needing a birdie at the last. He made bogey instead and missed the cut by two.",
      "Still, it was hard to believe Couples was wondering not long ago whether he could still play. He dealt with back issues last year and missed the cut badly, and he needed reassurance from the Masters that the club wanted him to keep competing.",
      "\"I'm playing next year for sure, yeah. They made that clear they wanted me to come back, so I'm coming back next year,\" said Couples, who is already the oldest player to make the cut in Masters history after accomplishing the feat two years ago.",
      "\u201cAgain, as soon as I get in that car and drive out Magnolia Lane and come back tomorrow and have a nice lunch, I'll be fine. But ... the goal is to make the cut at my age. I didn't, and I'm kind of spinning my wheels thinking just why it was so mediocre.\u201d",
      "Mediocre, perhaps, but still memorable.",
      "The Masters always is for Langer and Couples.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not any tournament,\" Couple said. \u201cOther people can say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m from Scotland, the British Open is the greatest.\u2019 The Masters is the greatest tournament of all time. It\u2019s just so unique.\u201d",

      "He didn\u2019t realize at the time it would help him rediscover his love for the game \u2014 and help his mental toughness, too.",
      "In his series of unscripted videos, the two-time U.S Open winner tries to break 50 playing with different celebrities like Tom Brady, John Daly and Tony Romo on the channel. He attempts to do the same with some cheaper versions of golf clubs purchased on discount websites likes Amazon and Temu. He\u2019s even attempted to break course records at places around the country he has never played before.",
      "\u201cYouTube golf has made me feel like a kid again,\u201d DeChambeau said Friday at Augusta National.",
      "DeChambeau seems to be more relaxed these days, and enters the weekend in the hunt for his first Masters title at 7-under 137 after 36 holes.",
      "He has gone to great lengths to change his image and brand, and the channel has helped boost his fanbase amid his move to Saudi-backed LIV golf.",
      "\u201cWhen I started out, I was like, man, this is going to be a lot of work,\u201d DeChambeau said. \u201cAnd once we started putting in challenges that were fun and interesting and different, it kind of made me feel like I was that, you know, 11-, 12-year-old going out with your friends and just trying to play as good as you can and do something crazy and different.\u201d",
      "DeChambeau's channel is a little crazy and different \u2014 and well received.",
      "It has more than 1.82 million subscribers.",
      "While DeChambeau is shown laughing and hamming it up with friends like Matthew Stafford and even President Donald Trump, he also believes the inherent challenge of trying to break a certain score or course record has strengthened his mindset in competitive events.",
      "The mindset is simple: There is a goal out there and he has to hit it.",
      "\u201cAs a kid, you get another club if your hand, OK, maybe it\u2019s not perfect but you have to figure out a way to get it done,\u201d DeChambeau said.",
      "The 31-year-old DeChambeau got it done Friday.",
      "After his tee shot on the par-3 fourth hole landed in the bunker on the left side of green \u2014 causing him to let out an \u201coh golly\u201d on the tee box \u2014 he regathered himself and holed a difficult chip from the sand.",
      "That birdie led to another on the difficult fifth hole, where he striped his drive 369 yards down the middle of the fairway.",
      "He added another birdie on the eighth and made the turn at 4-under 32. His only bogey came on the par-3 16th hole, but he bounced back with a birdie on 17 and finished with back-to-back rounds in the 60s (69-68) at the Masters for the first time in nine years.",
      "A year ago, DeChambeau opened the Masters with a 65 to take the 18-hole lead.",
      "He failed to break par the rest of the week, shooting 73-75-73 and finished tied for sixth place. This year, he has spent more time working on putts longer than 50 and 60 feet and practiced well into the night Thursday at Augusta National on his iron game.",
      "He's plenty confident his win last year at the U.S. Open at Pinehurst will help prepare him for the challenges that remain ahead this weekend.",
      "He said the experiences gained from his golf channel won't hurt, either.",
      "\u201cWhen I am doing the course record series, it\u2019s focusing my brain up to the maximum extent,\" DeChambeau said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not like it\u2019s costing me a lot of energy and I\u2019m not gaining much out of it. I\u2019m actually focusing myself and saying, hey, you\u2019re on camera, you have to execute. There\u2019s nothing else you can do besides play your absolute best.\u201d",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Texas man who says Titans cornerback L'Jarius Sneed or his personal assistant shot at him while he was sitting inside a Mercedes-Benz on a dealer lot in December is suing the two-time Super Bowl champ for at least $1 million.",
      "Christian Nshimiyimana was sitting inside the Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon on Dec. 6 in Carrollton, Texas. Neither he nor anyone else was hit by bullets fired from a Lamborghini Urus driving past One Legacy Motors. Much of what happened is redacted in the police report obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Attorney Levi McCathern said in a statement Friday that Sneed and his accomplice were arrested by the Carrollton Police Department for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after the shooting but have yet to answer for it. McCathern also accused Sneed and a woman who identified herself as Sneed's mother of calling and threatening Nshimiyimana afterward, wanting him to not cooperate with police or retain an attorney.",
      "\u201cThe proof is there,\u201d McCathern said. \u201cThere is video surveillance from the dealership showing the car and the person who opened fire on Christian. We want to know why this happened. We\u2019re thankful no one was shot, but we continue to search for the reason behind this incident.\u201d",
      "Agents for Sneed did not immediately responded to the AP's emails and messages Friday afternoon. A Titans spokesperson said the team is \"aware of the matter and have been in contact with NFL Security per league protocol.\"",
      "Nshimiyimana filed a civil lawsuit Feb. 20 in Dallas County, Texas, suing Sneed and a defendant listed as \u201cJohn Doe\u201d for \u201can unprovoked attack in cold blood and broad daylight.\u201d Nshimiyimana, 23, owns an exotic car rental business and was researching vehicles for his company. The lawsuit includes a still photo from surveillance video showing an arm reaching out of a sport-utility vehicle on the street with what the lawsuit describes as a pistol circled in red.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Nshimiyimana remembers seeing Sneed and his assistant at the car dealership but didn't recognize Sneed from his NFL career or television. Nshimiyimana also does not recall ever meeting Sneed before that day. The lawsuit notes the defendants may have mistaken Nshimiyimana for someone else.",
      "\u201cRegardless, the unprovoked aggravated assault of my client with a deadly weapon is part of a pattern of behavior for Mr. Sneed, and he must be held responsible for his actions so they do not happen again,\u201d McCathern said.",
      "The Titans traded for Sneed last March and made him one of the NFL's highest-paid cornerbacks with a new contract. Sneed played the first five games before a quadriceps injury eventually landed him on injured reserve. Sneed was drafted from Louisiana Tech in the fourth round in 2020 by Kansas City. He won back-to-back Super Bowls with the Chiefs in 2022 and 2023.",
      "McCathern said they got no response when they previously reached out to the Titans.",
      "\u201cIt is clear that the Titans manage their players off the field just as they do on the field. No wonder they were the worst team in the NFL last year,\u201d McCathern said of the team that holds the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft on April 24.",

      "Rory McIlroy is in the mix at the Masters after a second-round 66 at Augusta National",
      "AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Rory McIlroy\u2019s fragile mental state got a big boost when he left Augusta National on Thursday night, shortly after a pair of late double bogeys had cast a pall on an otherwise brilliant round, in time to put his 4-year-old daughter, Poppy, to bed.",
      "It got another when he arrived on Friday and spoke with famed sports psychologist Bob Rotella.",
      "His advice to McIlroy: Be patient.",
      "The 35-year-old Northern Irishman did exactly that during his second round of the Masters, methodically touring the first nine before catching fire on the second. He made three birdies and an eagle down the stretch, resulting in a 6-under 66 that put him right back in contention as McIlroy tries to chase down the only leg missing from the career Grand Slam.",
      "\u201cI think overall just proud of myself with how I responded today after the finish last night,\u201d said McIlroy, who after so many close calls seems to be the sentimental favorite \u2014 if not the outright one \u2014 to finally win a green jacket.",
      "\u201cI just had to remind myself that I played really good golf yesterday, and you know, I wasn't going to let, you know, two bad holes sort of dictate the narrative for the rest of the week. But yeah, just ultimately proud of how I got back into it today.\u201d",
      "McIlroy's run began at the 10th, when he stuck his approach within 2 feet. It continued at the next, when a 351-yard drive set up another good approach that McIlroy stuck to 5 feet for another birdie. On the par-3 12th, he was fortunate to see his tee shot bounce out of the bushes left of the green, leaving him with an up-and-down opportunity to save par.",
      "Then came the reachable par-5 13th, where McIlroy's drive found the pine straw right of the fairway.",
      "He had a good lie and nothing in his way, though, and about 190 yards to the front of the green. McIlroy went back and forth between his 4-iron and 5-iron, ultimately settled on the 4, and then thought for one frightful moment that a slight mishit might not have enough oomph to carry it past the water fronting the green.",
      "\u201cI was like: \u2018You idiot. What did you do?\u2019\u201d McIlroy said. \"It's a pin that even if you do hit it into the hazard, it's a pretty \u2014 not a routine up-and-down, but a little easier than, say, where the pin was yesterday in that front section.",
      "\u201cYeah,\u201d McIlroy said, \u201cI rode my luck a little bit with that second shot, but was nice to take advantage of it.\u201d",
      "McIlroy added another birdie at the par-5 15th, where his chip from behind the green Thursday took a big hop, picked up speed and rolled all the way into the water. It was the first of his two double bogeys down the stretch, and to come back and birdie the same hole less than 24 hours later underscored the way McIlroy was able to bounce back Friday.",
      "\u201cHe just kind of had it going. He didn\u2019t make many mistakes,\u201d said Akshay Bhatia, who played in the same group. \u201cHe drove it on a rope the first two days when I played with him. It\u2019s really cool to see. He\u2019s the best driver in our game.\u201d",
      "It was the sixth time that McIlroy shot 66 or better at the Masters, moving into a tie with Jack Nicklaus and Jordan Spieth for the second most in tournament history. Tiger Woods has eight such rounds \u2014 and five green jackets.",
      "Perhaps by the end of the weekend, McIlroy will have one, too.",
      "Justin Rose continued to lead the way, following his opening 65 with a 1-under 71 to reach 8 under. Bryson DeChambeau was one shot back after his 68 on Friday. Then came McIlroy, right behind them on a leaderboard filled with big names.",
      "He was quick to caution that leading on Friday is not the same as leading on Sunday. McIlroy has been in that position, too, and failed to finish the job. But he gave himself a chance with a stellar second round, and that was all he really wanted.",
      "\u201cAgain, golf tournaments are so long, and there\u2019s so much that can happen, even in the next 36 holes,\u201d McIlroy said. \"My mindset was: \u2018I shot even par yesterday. I probably need to get to somewhere between 12- and 15-under to win this tournament.\u2019",
      "\u201cYou know, there was plenty of time to do that. So yeah, again, just about staying patient.\u201d",

      "Nearly seven years after he was paralyzed in an IndyCar crash, Robert Wickens will return to elite competition when he drives a Corvette in the IMSA sports car race on the downtown streets of Long Beach",
      "LONG BEACH, Calif. -- Nearly seven years after he was paralyzed in an IndyCar crash, Robert Wickens will return to elite competition on Saturday when he drives a Corvette in the IMSA sports car race on the downtown streets of Long Beach.",
      "Wickens has raced since the crash at Pocono left him paralyzed from the chest down but considers the IMSA event a true completion of his comeback.",
      "\u201cMy goal from the outset of this was to get back to the highest levels of motorsport again. I\u2019ve always seen that (IMSA) is the highest level of sports car racing here in North America,\u201d Wickens said. \u201cIt would be a dream if I could call it a 10-year career here racing against the best drivers in the world and one of the best series in the world.\u201d",
      "Wickens will drive for DXDT Racing with teammate and longtime Corvette driver Tommy Milner. The Corvette is equipped with a hand-controlled throttle and braking system developed by Bosch and Pratt Miller. The brake controls mount to the steering wheel but are independent of the steering wheel so that Milner can seamlessly transition from hand controls to pedals when he\u2019s the driver.",
      "\u201cThe steering wheel that Tommy will be driving or any other teammate that I drive with in this Corvette, it\u2019s the exact same steering wheel that they always know. What\u2019s great about it is, in theory, it can mount to virtually any steering column as long as you have the right bolt pattern,\u201d Wickens said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re learning here today can transfer into any race car. And then, hopefully, down the road, what we\u2019re developing with the electronic braking system from Bosch, opportunities are endless. Maybe this can evolve into road safety and into everyday road vehicles and accessibility in road vehicles.",
      "\u201cBut short term, we need to perfect this system here.\u201d",
      "Wickens has most recently been a driver for Bryan Herta Autosport in the Michelin Pilot Challenge, which is a lower division of IMSA and in 2023 he won a class title. He\u2019s tested a Formula E car, did a demonstration for Honda in Canada, where he\u2019s from, and now will make his debut in IMSA\u2019s GT Daytona class.",
      "\u201cHonestly, taking the green flag in Long Beach is going to be an enormous step forward in my career and my journey back to the highest levels,\u201d Wickens said. \u201cYou could say, \u2018We did it. We\u2019re racing against the best cars and the best drivers in the whole sports car industry.\u2019\u201d",
      "The car Wickens and Milner are competing in is eligible for the GTD championship.",
      "\u201cI want to win championships for myself, for General Motors, for DXDT,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still some work to be done. I think you could say it\u2019s definitely a massive box to check, probably the biggest box that we could check off so far in my return.\u201d",
      "He\u2019d like to race full-time in the series next season.",
      "He and Milner are just getting to know each other, as well as the nuances of the car with the system Wickens must use versus how Milner will drive it.",
      "\u201cIn Robbie\u2019s case he has to do all of his driving with his hands. This system is basically set up so that he can do all that with the steering wheel itself,\u201d Milner said. \u201cThere\u2019s a brake ring and there are throttle paddles that take the place of what I would normally use in the pedal box. The system is quite impressive with how it functions and how it works. With just one push of a button, the system switches from the able-bodied driver controls to the hand controls, which obviously is important for sports car racing where we have driver changes.",
      "\u201cFundamentally, everything happens on the wheel. And it\u2019s a system that took me initially a little while to sort of understand in my own brain, how it is supposed to work, how to find lap time out of it and things like that.\u201d",
      "Milner has also been inspired by Wickens\u2019 journey since his life-changing crash in his rookie season of IndyCar racing. Aside from working with developers to create the technology needed to get him back to racing, he also works for Andretti Global as a driver coach in a multifaceted role in which he studies data analysis, driver guidance, and offers direct support at races.",
      "\u201cFor him to go through what he went through and with his drive and determination to get back in a race car again and be competitive and win races, that\u2019s something that can be an inspiration for anybody,\u201d Milner said. \u201cAnybody who\u2019s gone through some sort of hardship like he has, it\u2019s what you make of your life and that situation. You can tell that it does change parts of his life. But the one thing that he doesn\u2019t want it to change realistically is him driving race cars and driving them as fast as he does.\u201d",

      "But from that point Tsitsipas' serve evaporated. He made less than half of his first serves, only eight of 28 in the last set. One of his seven double faults put him down 4-3 in the last set. Musetti won the last two sets 6-3, 6-4.",

      "AUGUSTA, Ga. -- When PGA Tour rookie Matt McCarty knocked his tee shot on the 180-yard, par-3 sixth hole at the Masters to within 8 feet to set up his first birdie and then sank a bending 28-foot putt for another on the par-4 seventh, his mother knew exactly what was coming next.",
      "She could tell just by her son\u2019s strut he was about to go on a heater.",
      "\u201cHe tends to do that,\u201d Deanna McCarty said. \u201cHe gets in kind of a rhythm, and you can just see it in his walk. You can see it in how he carries himself. He did it in college, and he did it on the Korn Ferry Tour, where he just gets hot. He just gets super focused and locked in.\u201d",
      "Five holes into the second round on Friday, the 27-year-old McCarty thought his first Masters appearance was going to be a short-lived one.",
      "He was 3-over par for the day and 2 over for the tournament with the cut line looming.",
      "And then the left-hander from Scottsdale, Arizona, settled down, and strung together eight birdies over the next 12 holes. It not only assured he\u2019d be playing over the weekend, but also vaulted him near the top of the leaderboard at 5-under 139 for the tournament.",
      "\u201cYeah, 100%, I was thinking about the cut,\u201d said McCarty, who followed up a 71 on Thursday with a 68 despite a bogey on 18. \u201cI didn\u2019t really hit a good shot until 6. I think that was my first green of the day. I knew if I got back to the basics and kept it simple I\u2019d be all right.",
      "\u201cI didn't get too rattled,\" he added.",
      "McCarty had plenty of support to help keep him calm at Augusta National.",
      "Nearly two dozen family members and friends came to watch him play, including his parents, two sisters and his girlfriend. They rented three Airbnbs in the Augusta area and have been celebrating his inaugural appearance at the Masters all week.",
      "McCarty spent three seasons on the lower level Korn Ferry Tour, where he won player of the year in 2024 and earned his tour card following three wins. He secured a spot in the Masters when he won the Black Desert Championship \u2014 he shot 23-under 261 \u2014 in just his third career event on tour.",
      "McCarty isn't the first newcomer to play well at the Masters.",
      "Sweden's Ludvig Aberg finished second to Scottie Scheffler for the green jacket last year.",
      "McCarty remembers his first visit to Augusta National when he was 11, but his biggest takeaway was the tasty Moon Pies and sweet tea after walking up a bunch of hills.",
      "He played four practice rounds here last week to get reacquainted with the terrain and learn the speedy greens. He called it \"my own little tournament,\" although the results weren't so great.",
      "\u201cI would have been a lot closer to making the cut than I am now after these first two days,\" McCarty joked.",
      "Despite gaining some confidence from the practice rounds, McCarty admitted he was riddled with butterflies in his stomach when the tournament began.",
      "But he quickly turned that into a positive.",
      "\u201cYeah, 100%,\" McCarty said. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to kind of just reframe that. I think I\u2019ve learned over the last few years, reframe that nervousness into excitement. Who\u2019s not excited to come out and play in the Masters? Who\u2019s not nervous to come out and play in the Masters?\u201d",
      "If things go astray he can always lean on the support of his family, who've religiously followed him around the course cheering on every shot.",
      "\u201cHonestly, this is all still so surreal,\u201d Deanna McCarty said. \u201cBut we're so proud of him.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Gabriel Landeskog played in a professional game Friday night for the first time in nearly three years as he suited up with the Colorado Eagles of the American Hockey League",
      "LOVELAND, Colo. -- Gabriel Landeskog warmed up on the ice Friday night like this was just another game. He took his first shift, chased after a puck, dished out a light check and got called for a hooking penalty as if this was just another game, too.",
      "It wasn't. All the cameras trying to preserve the moment were proof of that. Landeskog suited up in a professional game for the first time in nearly three years as he joined the Colorado Eagles of the American Hockey League.",
      "The longtime Colorado Avalanche captain is on loan to the Eagles as part of a minor league conditioning assignment. He went through the morning skate at Blue Arena in Loveland, Colorado, and was given the green light to make his Eagles debut against the Henderson Silver Knights.",
      "He went through pregame drills \u2014 sans his helmet so his blond hair was easy to spot \u2014 to cheers and was serenaded with chants of \u201cLandy, Landy, Landy\u201d just before puck drop. The fans cheered when he left the ice after his first shift, which lasted about 46 seconds, and again after he went to the penalty box, with his image shown on the big screen (he waved to the crowd).",
      "This was a pricey ticket, too (around $200). His just-unveiled Eagles No. 92 sweater was coveted as well, with fans waiting in a long line that snaked around the concourse for a chance to purchase one. His Avalanche jersey was a popular sight all over the venue.",
      "Landeskog has been sidelined since he helped the Avalanche win the Stanley Cup in 2022 because of a knee injury and subsequent surgeries.",
      "If all goes well with his Loveland stint, the 32-year-old gritty forward from Sweden could be activated for Game 1 of Colorado\u2019s first-round playoff series. The Avalanche enter the postseason locked into the Central Division\u2019s No. 3 seed and will open on the road.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited for him and his family,\u201d coach Jared Bednar said Friday before the team left for its two-game trip to California to close out the regular season. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s been a long, hard road and to finally get back on the ice in a game situation, I\u2019m just thrilled for him.\u201d",
      "Some of his Avalanche teammates, such as Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar, were at the arena to catch a glimpse of No. 92 in an Eagles sweater. MacKinnon and Makar were among several players skipping Colorado's final trip to get some rest before the playoffs.",
      "\u201cHe put a lot of work in, a lot of time,\u201d defenseman Erik Johnson, a longtime friend of Landeskog, said. \u201cIt's something he didn\u2019t have to put his body through but wanted to for the team. To have him get this far in his recovery is exciting for us.\u201d",
      "Landeskog\u2019s injury dates back to the 2020 \u201cbubble\u201d season when he was accidentally sliced above the knee by the skate of Makar in a playoff game against Dallas. Landeskog eventually underwent a cartilage transplant procedure on May 10, 2023, and has been on long-term injured reserve.",
      "The procedure was similar to the one performed on Chicago Bulls point guard Lonzo Ball in March 2023. Ball returned to the court for a preseason game in October, which hinted at a possible timeline for Landeskog\u2019s return.",
      "Landeskog\u2019s comeback has been the subject of a documentary series called \u201cA Clean Sheet: Gabe Landeskog\u201d that\u2019s airing on TNT and TruTV.",
      "This is Landeskog's 13th season as a captain, with only Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin serving as leaders of their current teams for a longer span.",
      "\u201cHe carries such a weight within the locker room,\u201d Colorado forward Logan O\u2019Connor said. \u201cObviously, his voice is huge.\u201d",
      "As for the plan with Landeskog after Friday, Bednar said that's still to be determined. Over his career, Landeskog has been nearly a point-a-game player in six playoff runs with the Avalanche.",
      "\u201cThis is the toughest time of the year to jump back into a lineup, right? And he\u2019s still not there yet,\" Bednar said. \"We\u2019ll just see how he does tonight, and we\u2019ll just keep reevaluating from there, just like we would do with any other injury. But the length of time that this has gone on, it\u2019s significant.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019ll see how he looks in practice. We\u2019ll make the decisions on our lineup for the games if he gets that point, and go from there. But still one day at a time.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been predicting its barrage of tariffs targeting China will push Apple into manufacturing the iPhone in the U",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump's administration has been predicting its barrage of tariffs targeting China will push Apple into manufacturing the iPhone in the United States for the first time.",
      "But that's an unlikely scenario even with U.S tariffs now standing at 145% on products made in China \u2014 the country where Apple has manufactured most of its iPhones since the first model hit the market 18 years ago.",
      "The disincentives for Apple shifting its production domestically include a complex supply chain that it began building in China during the 1990s. It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product.",
      "\u201cThe concept of making iPhones in the U.S. is a non-starter,\u201d asserted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, reflecting a widely held view in the investment community that tracks Apple's every move. He estimated that the current $1,000 price tag for an iPhone made in China, or India, would soar to more than $3,000 if production shifted to the U.S. And he believes that moving production domestically likely couldn't be done until, at the earliest, 2028. \u201cPrice points would move so dramatically, it's hard to comprehend.\u201d",
      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment Wednesday. The Cupertino, California, company has yet to publicly discuss its response to Trump\u2019s tariffs on China, but the topic may come up on May 1 when Apple CEO Tim Cook is scheduled to field questions from analysts during a quarterly conference call to discuss the company\u2019s financial results and strategy.",
      "And there is no doubt the China tariffs will be a hot-button issue given Apple\u2019s stock price has dropped by nearly 20% and lowered the company\u2019s market value by $600 billion since Trump began increasing them on April 2.",
      "If the tariffs hold, Apple is widely expected to eventually raise the prices on iPhones and other popular products because the Silicon Valley\u2019s supply chain is so heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets caught in the crossfire of the escalating trade war.",
      "The big question is how long Apple might be willing to hold the line on its current prices before the tariffs\u2019 toll on the company\u2019s profit margins become too much to bear and consumers are asked to shoulder some of the burden.",
      "One of the main reasons that Apple has wiggle room to hold the line on its current iPhone pricing while the China tariffs remain in place is because the company continues to reap huge profit margins from the revenue generated by the subscriptions and other services tied to its product, said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee. That division, which collected $96 billion in revenue during Apple\u2019s last fiscal year, remains untouched by Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cApple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\u201d Chatterjee said.",
      "Apple tried to appease Trump in February by announcing plans to spend $500 billion and hire 20,000 people in the U.S. through 2028, but none of it was tied to making an iPhone domestically. Instead, Apple pledged to fund a Houston data center for computer servers powering artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology the company is expanding into as part of an industrywide craze.",
      "When asked this week about whether Trump believes Apple intends to build iPhones in the U.S., White House Press Secretary Karoline Levitt pointed to Apple's investment promise as evidence that the company thinks it could be done. \u201cIf Apple didn\u2019t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn\u2019t have put up that big chunk of change,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also predicted tariffs would force a manufacturing shift during an April 6 appearance on a CBS news program. \u201cThe army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,\u201d Lutnick said.",
      "But during a 2017 appearance at a conference in China, Cook expressed doubt about whether the U.S. labor pool had enough workers with the vocational skills required to do the painstaking and tedious work that Lutnick was discussing.",
      "\u201cIn the U.S. you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I\u2019m not sure we could fill the room,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIn China, you could fill multiple football fields.\u201d",
      "Trump also tried to pressure Apple, to no avail, into shifting iPhone production to the U.S. during his first term as president. But the administration ultimately exempted the iPhone from the tariffs he imposed on China back then \u2014 a period when Apple had announced a commitment to invest $350 billion in the U.S. Trump's first-term tariffs on China also prompted Apple to begin a process that led to some of its current iPhones being made in India and some of its other products being manufactured in Vietnam.",
      "Cook also took the president on a 2019 tour of a Texas plant where Apple had been assembling some of its Mac computers since 2013. Shortly after finishing that our, Trump took credit for the plant that Apple had opened while Barack Obama was president. \"Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America,\u201d Trump posted on Nov. 19, 2019.",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s loving this, this control over markets, but he better be careful,\u201d said Trump critic and former White House ethics lawyer, Richard Painter, noting that securities law prohibits trading on insider information or helping others do so. \u201cThe people who bought when they saw that post made a lot of money.\u201d",

Riley Securities.",
      "The two companies announced on Jan. 21 that they were altering the agreement that had made Microsoft the exclusive provider of OpenAI's computing power, enabling the smaller company to build its own capacity, \u201cprimarily for research and training of models.\u201d It was the same day that newly inaugurated President Donald Trump touted OpenAI's partnership with Oracle and SoftBank to pledge $500 billion in new AI infrastructure in the U.S., starting with a data center in Texas.",
      "Microsoft has long built data centers around the world to run its cloud computing services. The generative AI boom accelerated the demand for such facilities, both to train new AI systems and to keep them running as millions of people start using chatbots and other AI tools at work and home.",
      "The computing it takes to run AI tools is expensive and requires a large amount of electricity \u2014 so much so that Trump this week cited AI needs as part of the justification for using his emergency authorities to boost the U.S. coal industry, a reliable but polluting energy source. Tech companies have also sought to tap into nuclear power, including a proposed Microsoft-backed revival of the shuttered Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, which would feed an electricity grid supplying data centers in Ohio as well as Virginia, the nation's biggest data center hub.",
      "Microsoft said it still plans to spend more than $80 billion globally to expand its AI infrastructure this fiscal year, which ends in June, and has already doubled its data center capacity over the past three years.",
      "\u201cWhile we may strategically pace our plans, we will continue to grow strongly and allocate investments that stay aligned with business priorities and customer demand,\u201d Walsh said.",
      "The Ohio pause nevertheless came as a disappointment to local officials.",
      "Licking County has also attracted data center investments from Microsoft rivals Google and Meta Platforms and a highly anticipated semiconductor factory from Intel, though the struggling chipmaker in February pushed back the expected completion date for the project's first stage to 2030.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Thanks to a mouse watching clips from \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d scientists have created the largest functional map of a brain to date \u2013 a diagram of the wiring connecting 84,000 neurons as they fire off messages.",
      "Using a piece of that mouse\u2019s brain about the size of a poppy seed, the researchers identified those neurons and traced how they communicated via branch-like fibers through a surprising 500 million junctions called synapses.",
      "The massive dataset, published Wednesday by the journal Nature, marks a step toward unraveling the mystery of how our brains work. The data, assembled in a 3D reconstruction colored to delineate different brain circuitry, is open to scientists worldwide for additional research \u2013 and for the simply curious to take a peek.",
      "\u201cIt definitely inspires a sense of awe, just like looking at pictures of the galaxies,\u201d said Forrest Collman of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, one of the project\u2019s leading researchers. \u201cYou get a sense of how complicated you are. We\u2019re looking at one tiny part ... of a mouse\u2019s brain and the beauty and complexity that you can see in these actual neurons and the hundreds of millions of connections between them.\u201d",
      "How we think, feel, see, talk and move are due to neurons, or nerve cells, in the brain \u2013 how they\u2019re activated and send messages to each other. Scientists have long known those signals move from one neuron along fibers called axons and dendrites, using synapses to jump to the next neuron. But there\u2019s less known about the networks of neurons that perform certain tasks and how disruptions of that wiring could play a role in Alzheimer's, autism or other disorders.",
      "\u201cYou can make a thousand hypotheses about how brain cells might do their job but you can\u2019t test those hypotheses unless you know perhaps the most fundamental thing \u2013 how are those cells wired together,\u201d said Allen Institute scientist Clay Reid, who helped pioneer electron microscopy to study neural connections.",
      "With the new project, a global team of more than 150 researchers mapped neural connections that Collman compares to tangled pieces of spaghetti winding through part of the mouse brain responsible for vision.",
      "The first step: Show a mouse video snippets of sci-fi movies, sports, animation and nature.",
      "A team at Baylor College of Medicine did just that, using a mouse engineered with a gene that makes its neurons glow when they\u2019re active. The researchers used a laser-powered microscope to record how individual cells in the animal\u2019s visual cortex lit up as they processed the images flashing by.",
      "Next, scientists at the Allen Institute analyzed that small piece of brain tissue, using a special tool to shave it into more than 25,000 layers, each far thinner than a human hair. With electron microscopes, they took nearly 100 million high-resolution images of those sections, illuminating those spaghetti-like fibers and painstakingly reassembling the data in 3D.",
      "Finally, Princeton University scientists used artificial intelligence to trace all that wiring and \u201cpaint each of the individual wires a different color so that we can identify them individually,\u201d Collman explained.",
      "They estimated that microscopic wiring, if laid out, would measure more than 3 miles (5 kilometers). Importantly, matching up all that anatomy with the activity in the mouse's brain as it watched movies allowed researchers to trace how the circuitry worked.",
      "The Princeton researchers also created digital 3D copies of the data that other scientists can use in developing new studies.",
      "Could this kind of mapping help scientists eventually find treatments for brain diseases? The researchers call it a foundational step, like how the Human Genome Project that provided the first gene mapping eventually led to gene-based treatments. Mapping a full mouse brain is one next goal.",
      "\u201cThe technologies developed by this project will give us our first chance to really identify some kind of abnormal pattern of connectivity that gives rise to a disorder,\u201d another of the project's leading researchers, Princeton neuroscientist and computer scientist Sebastian Seung, said in a statement.",

      "Given the limited sampling, it\u2019s uncertain how widespread this dry condition might be, the scientists noted in their study published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cMore far side samples are required for testing and further unraveling\" how much water there is, Hu said in an email.",
      "It\u2019s possible the impact that created this basin may have blasted water elements to the near side, leaving the far side depleted. Another possibility is that the vertical distribution of water could be different between the two hemispheres.",
      "Even if confirmed, the findings shouldn\u2019t drastically alter NASA\u2019s plans to send astronauts to the moon\u2019s south polar region, where permanently shadowed craters are believed to hold massive amounts of ice. This frozen water could be used for drinking, cooking and making rocket fuel.",
      "NASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year under its Artemis program, the successor to Apollo, which put 12 men on the moon from 1969 through 1972. That would be followed by a landing near the lunar south pole by astronauts no earlier than 2027. China is seeking its own astronaut moon landing by 2030.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- The nominee for NASA\u2019s top job, billionaire spacewalker Jared Isaacman, outlined his vision for space exploration on Wednesday that prioritizes sending astronauts to Mars.",
      "President Donald Trump nominated Isaacman to become NASA\u2019s 15th administrator late last year. If confirmed, the tech entrepreneur would become the youngest person to lead the space agency that is eyeing returning astronauts to the moon and among only a handful of administrators to have actually rocketed into orbit.",
      "The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee gathered in Washington for the nomination hearing.",
      "\u201cAs the president stated we will prioritize sending American astronauts to Mars. Along the way, we will inevitably have the capabilities to return to the Moon, Isaacman said in his written testimony.",
      "Isaacman, 42, has already flown in space twice, buying his own trips with SpaceX, and performed the world\u2019s first private spacewalk last September. He made his fortune with a payment processing company he started as a high school dropout in his parents\u2019 basement, now called Shift4.",
      "He acknowledged in his testimony that he is not \u201ca typical nominee for this position.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have been relatively apolitical; I am not a scientist and I never worked at NASA\" he said in his written remarks. \u201cI do not think these are weaknesses.\u201d",
      "The space agency and others were anxious to hear Isaacman\u2019s stand on the moon and Mars for human exploration, given his close association with SpaceX\u2019s Elon Musk.",
      "In the audience were the three U.S. astronauts and one Canadian assigned to NASA\u2019s flight to the moon planned for next year.",
      "NASA has been pitching the moon as the next logical step for astronauts for years. The Artemis program aims to send a crew around the moon next year and land astronauts near the moon\u2019s south pole as early as 2027. Lunar bases are planned this time around, not just quick visits like the ones during NASA\u2019s Apollo missions in the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "Artemis has been slow going and expensive, especially for NASA\u2019s Space Launch System rocket. It\u2019s only blasted off once so far \u2014 in 2022 without a crew.",
      "Musk favors Mars as a destination, as he ramps up more test flights out of Texas for Starship, the world\u2019s biggest and most powerful rocket. By making Starship reusable, he intends to dramatically lower costs of getting people and equipment to the red planet.",
      "NASA has chosen Starship for its first two astronaut landings on the moon under Artemis, named after Apollo\u2019s twin sister in Greek mythology.",

It eventually provided them in Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French and Samoan. The contract lapse comes as President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to slash spending in federal agencies, including cuts within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that have led to high employee vacancy rates at NWS offices.",

      "The president did not release medical details during the 2024 campaign.",
      "President Donald Trump told reporters he \"got every answer right,\" on a cognitive test during his annual physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One after the physical, Trump said he thinks he did well and that he believed the full report would be released Sunday.",
      "He did not share many other specific details from the exam -- which was the first of his second term. He said the exam showed a \"good heart, a good soul, very good soul.\"",
      "He boarded Air Force One headed to Florida shortly before 6 p.m. after spending about five hours at the hospital.",
      "\"I have never felt better, but nevertheless, these things must be done!\" Trump, who, at 78, became the oldest president to be sworn into office, posted on Truth Social earlier in the week.",
      "The public hasn't been provided a detailed look into Trump's health since 2018 and during the 2024 presidential campaign, he didn't provide any details about his health despite numerous promises to do so.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Friday that the president's physician will provide \"an update on the report in the effort of transparency,\" adding, \"as many results as possible,\" and \"as soon as we possibly can.\"",
      "The summary of physicals traditionally provided is a narrative of the physical fitness that the patient allows to be shared. It has never been a full transparent release of medical records.",
      "What Trump's last official presidential checkup revealed",
      "In the January 2018 evaluation, Trump appeared to be in \"excellent\" cardiovascular shape for his age, according to then-White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson, who administered Trump's nearly four-hour physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.",
      "The president's medical issues were limited to high cholesterol, rosacea (a benign skin condition) and being considered \"overweight,\" as measured by body mass index (BMI).",
      "Trump's LDL cholesterol level was 143 mg/dL and total cholesterol level was 223 mg/dL. Total cholesterol should be less than 200 mg/dL. Trump\u2019s LDL cholesterol level, in particular, is significantly higher than normal, which should be less than 100 mg/dL.",
      "His BMI is calculated at 29.9 kg/m2, using the National Institutes of Health calculator, which is just shy of the obesity classification, which starts with a score of greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2.",
      "The 2018 report said the president takes a cholesterol-lowering drug called rosuvastatin, and because his cholesterol level was a little high, Jackson increased the dosage.",
      "Trump was also taking finasteride for male-pattern hair loss. That medication can also be used to treat prostate issues.",
      "Trump also takes aspirin daily to prevent heart disease, a multivitamin and applies a cream called ivermectin, as needed, to treat the skin condition rosacea.",
      "At Trump's urging, his physician conducted a brief screening test called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Jackson claimed Trump had a perfect 30/30 score.",
      "COVID hospitalization",
      "In October 2020, Trump was hospitalized after he contracted COVID-19. Then White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said that Trump had a fever and his blood oxygen levels had dropped rapidly.",
      "Sources with knowledge of the situation told ABC News that Trump was having trouble breathing and was given supplemental oxygen.",
      "Doctors gave Trump an experimental course of monoclonal antibodies and steroids to treat him and he returned to the White House after three days.",
      "Trump's health post 1st term",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 19:27:15 -0400",
    "summary": "Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil appeared before an immigration judge in Louisiana on Friday who decided he can be deported.",
    "story": [
      "Khalil, a pro-Palestinian protester, has an American wife about to give birth.",
      "An immigration judge ruled Friday that Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil can be deported on grounds that he threatens foreign policy, as alleged by the Trump administration.",
      "The stunning move may have repercussions on hundreds of other international students who have been targeted by the administration.",
      "The Louisiana judge has given Khalil's lawyers a deadline of April 23 to file applications for relief to stop his deportation. The judge said if they failed to make the deadline, she would file an order of removal to either Syria or Algeria.",
      "The ruling stunned supporters in the court as the judge issued it. Some supporters in the courthouse began to weep as she agreed with the government's assertion that they did not have to provide any evidence in addition for the administration's main claim against Khalil.",
      "Khalil, a green card holder and permanent legal resident who is married to an American citizen, addressed the court after the hearing was adjourned and spoke to the judge directly, referring to a previous comment she had made about due process and \"fundamental fairness.\"",
      "\"I would like to quote what you said last time, that there's nothing that's more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness. Clearly what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process. This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family. I just hope that the urgency that you deemed fit for me are afforded to the hundreds of others who have been here without hearing for months,\" he said.",
      "Judge Jamee Comans' decision to remove Khalil fell in line with Secretary of State Marco Rubio's assertion that his continued presence and actions in the country poses \"adverse foreign policy consequence.\"",
      "One of Khalil's supporters read a statement from Khalil's wife, Noor Abdalla, after the ruling, calling it a \"devastating blow to our family.\"",
      "\"No person should be deemed removable from their home for speaking out against the killing of Palestinian families, doctors and journalists,\" Abdalla's statement said. \"Today, in court, the government reiterated the same baseless racist claims about my husband that we have heard time and again, an attempt to smear those calling for an end to Israel's brutal genocide in Gaza. My husband is a political prisoner who is being deprived of his rights because he believes Palestinians deserve equal dignity and freedom.\"",
      "She continued, \"There is nothing the government can say about my husband that can silence this truth.\u00a0This ruling is an indictment of our country's immigration system and does not reflect truth, justice or the will of the American people.\"",
      "In a blistering statement posted to X, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the ruling that Kahlil can be removed from the U.S. should come as \"welcome news,\" writing, \"It is a privilege to be granted a visa or green card to live and study in the United States of America.\" She ended the statement with \"Good riddance.\"",
      "The deportation hearing played out as a federal court case in New Jersey remains active. A judge in that case has ruled that Khalil cannot be deported while the proceedings are ongoing.",
      "\"Today, we saw our worst fears play out: Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent. This is not over, and our fight continues,\" Marc Van Der Hout, an attorney for Khalil, said in a statement Friday. \"If Mahmoud can be targeted in this way, simply for speaking out for Palestinians and exercising his constitutionally protected right to free speech, this can happen to anyone over any issue the Trump administration dislikes. We will continue working tirelessly until Mahmoud is free and rightfully returned home to his family and community.\"",
      "The immigration court has several limits on discovery and power to subpoena witnesses, as the judge mentioned several times on Friday.",
      "The judge had given the government a deadline earlier this week to present evidence to back up several allegations it made against Khalil as grounds to deport him from the U.S., including that he misrepresented information on his green card application.",
      "Despite Khalil's team presenting evidence that went against the administration's narrative of their client, including interviews where he had denounced antisemitism, the judge did not rule on that rebuttal or information and instead agreed that she need not go further than a two-page memo Rubio penned and submitted to the court this week.",
      "\"Today's ruling is a rush to judgment on baseless charges that the government presented no evidence to substantiate because no evidence exists. Our client, Mr. Khalil, has been unlawfully detained in direct retaliation of his advocacy in support of Palestinian rights,\" said Amol Sinha, executive director of the ACLU-NJ, which is also representing Khalil. \"This finding of removability is a dangerous departure from the fundamental freedoms at the bedrock of our nation that protect free speech under the First Amendment. We will continue to advocate for Mr. Khalil's rightful release, and we are confident he will prevail.\"",
      "While a student at Columbia University, Khalil was part of a leadership group protesting the war in Gaza. Khalil took part in negotiations with school administrators demanding the institution cut ties with Israel and divest from Israeli companies. Khalil finished his graduate studies at Columbia in December and is set to graduate in the spring.",
      "Khalil -- whose wife is about to give birth to their first child -- was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at his Columbia housing in March.",
      "The government on Thursday entered into evidence the memo signed by Rubio saying that he found Khalil's presence in the U.S. \"would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\"",
      "Attorneys for Khalil argued in a press conference on Thursday that the government -- which entered the letter and other documents into evidence Wednesday -- did not present evidence that Khalil's presence in the U.S. poses an adverse foreign policy consequence.",
      "The government has argued, under an obscure 1952 federal law called the Immigration and Nationality Act, that it believes migrants are deportable \"if the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe that the alien's presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "Attorneys for Khalil argued that determination is for a judge to make, after the government presents evidence.",
      "The memo signed by Rubio also makes the case that another person, whose name is redacted, should be deportable under the same law.",
      "Rubio wrote that Khalil should be deported because of his alleged role in \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities, which fosters a hostile environment for Jewish students in the United States.\"",
      "Van Der Hout sharply criticized the memo during a Zoom press conference on Thursday.",
      "Rubio \"talks about First Amendment activity in the\u00a0United States\u00a0and the effect on people in the U.S. His 'determination' has absolutely nothing to do with foreign policy,\" Van Der Hout said.",
      "Khalil's attorneys said the government did not present evidence as to the alleged misrepresented information Khalil made on his green card application.",
      "During a Zoom press conference on Friday, his legal team said they plan to file the applications for relief by the April 23 deadline. One of the forms of relief the attorneys said they are considering is filing for asylum. They anticipate there being a few more hearings in immigration court before a final decision is made, at which point there could be appeals, the legal team said.",
      "Van Der Hout said that based on the proceedings in the immigration court, they believe the federal district court is \"the only place\" that Khalil is \"going to get any real justice.\"",
      "\"What happened in immigration court today only confirms the need for the federal court to really intervene and make a decision in this case, because the immigration court made clear today that it won't, and believes it can't,\" Amy Belsher, NYCLU senior staff attorney, said during the press conference.",

    "summary": "High-level delegations from the United States and Iran are meeting over the weekend in Oman to discuss Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
    "story": [
      "The outcome could determine whether the Trump admin takes military action.",
      "High-level delegations from the United States and Iran are meeting over the weekend in Oman to discuss Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, holding what the White House says will be direct conversations for the first time in seven years.",
      "The meeting comes as experts broadly agree that Iran's breakout time for amassing enough fissile material to produce a nuclear warhead has dwindled to just one to two weeks -- and that Tehran could produce a deliverable nuclear weapon in less than a year.",
      "Despite opening a line of communication with Iran, the Trump administration is playing hardball -- with the president himself repeatedly making it clear in the past week that Iran's alternate option to taking a deal was coming under military attack, setting the stage for a high-stakes diplomatic showdown.",
      "Already at odds?",
      "Ahead of the scheduled meeting, both sides presented different ideas of how the talks would transpire.",
      "From the time President Donald Trump made the surprise announcement that his administration would soon engage with Iran during an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, he was adamant that the two countries wouldn't rely on an intermediary.",
      "\"We're having direct talks with Iran, and they've started. It'll go on Saturday,\" Trump said. \"We have a very big meeting, and we'll see what can happen.\"",
      "But officials in Tehran quickly rejected that, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi saying the meeting on April 12 would be \"indirect high-level talks.\"",
      "\"It is as much an opportunity as it is a test,\" he wrote in a social media post on X.",
      "\"Well, I have spoken to both the president and also his national security team who will be engaged in these discussions. These will be direct talks with the Iranians,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back on Friday.",
      "\"The ultimate objective is to ensure that Iran can never obtain a nuclear weapon. The president believes in diplomacy, direct talks, talking directly in the same room in order to achieve that goal,\" she continued.",
      "If the White House's vision is realized, the talks would mark the first time that delegations from Iran and the U.S. have met face to face since 2018, when Trump exited a nuclear deal with Iran, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was brokered during the Obama administration.",
      "New approaches, looming deadlines",
      "When it comes to gaining insight into the Trump administration's strategy, the format of the talks may not be as significant as the fact that the talks are slated to happen in the first place.",
      "Doreen Horschig, a fellow with the Project on Nuclear Issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and Bailey Schiff, a program coordinator and research assistant for the program, argued the president's approach to Iran has progressed.",
      "\"The Trump administration's Iran strategy has evolved from a first-term approach focused on maximum economic pressure to a second-term strategy that combines diplomacy, military threats and sanctions,\" they said, adding that the game plan now relies on \"diplomatic outreach, military posturing and sustained economic pressure.\"",
      "\"What matters is that they're talking,\" Trita Parsi, the executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, wrote in an op-ed for Time magazine.",
      "Parsi also argued that the timing is critical for Iran and the U.S.",
      "\"Despite his aggressive talk and military posturing, Trump cannot afford another major war in the Middle East,\" he said. \"He has long been a candidate who promises to bring U.S. troops home -- not entangle them in a new war.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Parsi noted that Iran is up against a potentially worsening economic outlook.",
      "Already limited by extensive U.S. sanctions, Tehran must also contend with the JCPOA's \"snapback mechanism\" -- a sort of emergency brake built into the deal that allows for United Nations sanctions to be automatically reimposed if Iran violates the terms of the deal.",
      "European countries who are still party to the JCPOA have until Oct. 18 to trigger the snapback function of the agreement and appear increasingly motivated to do so ahead of the deadline.",
      "But given Iran's fast-tracked nuclear breakout timeline, the U.S. -- and other countries that don't want to see a nuclear-capable Tehran -- are also feeling a crunch.",
      "As of now, there's no indication that the Iranian regime has given the orders to move to the next level when it comes to developing a nuclear warhead, but many U.S. officials assess it is under increasing pressure to do so from hard-liners because of perceived threats to Iran's security and broader unrest through the Middle East.",
      "Carrots and sticks",
      "Despite a willingness to engage from the Trump administration and economic pressure pushing the Iranian regime, negotiators may struggle to devise a deal that can incentivize all sides, according to former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Daniel B. Shapiro, a distinguished fellow with the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative.",
      "\"If and when talks get serious, the two sides will face major gaps,\" said Shapiro, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East and senior adviser for the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs.",
      "Shapiro noted that Trump, like the Biden administration before him, is seeking a stronger agreement than the JCPOA.",
      "\"His aims include fully dismantling Tehran's nuclear program,\" Shapiro said. \"Based on all Iranian behavior in previous rounds of negotiations, there is no reason to believe Tehran would agree to these terms.\"",
      "Even if Iran did concede, Shapiro argued Tehran would likely expect massive sanction relief -- something Congress is unlikely to sign off on.",
      "Trump has indicated that if a deal can't be reached, combined military action with Israel against Iran is the next option.",
      "\"If it requires military, we're going to have military,\" Trump said on Wednesday. \"Israel will obviously be very much involved in that. They'll be the leader of that.\"",
      "\"He and his team surely know that within a relatively short time, he is likely to face the decision point on whether or not to pursue a military strike,\" Shapiro said. \"The timing, need and opportunity may never be more compelling.\"",

      "\"The President is abusing the powers of his office to wield the might of the Executive Branch in retaliation against organizations and people that he dislikes,\" the lawsuit, filed in Washington D.C., states.",
      "For years Susman Godfrey has represented the voting machine company Dominion, famously securing a $787.5 million settlement from Fox News to settle allegations the network aired false claims about the company rigging the 2020 election. Now, the firm says Trump is trying to \"punish\" them for their work \"defending the integrity of the 2020 presidential election.\"",
      "\"If President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders are allowed to stand, future presidents will face no constraint when they seek to retaliate against a different set of perceived foes,\" the lawsuit states. \"What for two centuries has been beyond the pale will become the new normal. Put simply, this could be any of us.\"",
      "Notably, Susman Godfrey still represents Dominion in its active cases against a number of Trump\u2019s allies -- including Rudy Giuliani, Mike Lindell and others.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump signed an executive order targeting the firm, which seeks to block their access from government buildings and cancel government contracts, among others, over their \"previous activities.\"",
      "In its lawsuit, Susman says that \"at least a third\" of the firm\u2019s current matters call for their attorneys to appear in federal courts or interact with federal agencies in some way, and that they would be \"irreparably harmed\" by the order.",

      "McFadden also said the government \"cherry-picked\" a quote from the testimony of the Associated Press' Chief White House Correspondent Zeke Miller, who acknowledged under Justice Department cross-examination that the news organization was able to cover events such as the president's press conferences with the leaders of France and the United Kingdom by flying in the reporters who cover them in Paris and London.",
      "\"As the court previously found, the AP's text journalists have been systematically banned from large, limited-access events open to the entire White House press corps,\" McFadden said, adding that the ban the Associated Press has experienced \"need not be complete to be unconstitutional or irreparable.\"",

      "China is prepared to withstand the economic pain, according to experts.",
      "Xi Jinping is playing hardball.",
      "The Chinese president wants to show his people that the country can withstand the economic pain from President Donald Trump's tariffs and stand up to what Beijing is calling America's \"bullying,\" according to experts.",
      "Trump's trade war also feeds into the strategy that Xi has been working on for years: become less reliant on the United States.",
      "This breakdown in trade is \"exactly what Beijing has been preparing for,\" said Jude Blanchette, director of the RAND China Research Center. \"Beijing is not looking for negotiation.\"",
      "The world's superpowers are engaged in a risky game of chicken, experts told ABC News. The question is who blinks first.",
      "\"At the moment, Xi seems to be calculating that China can withstand the damage and that ultimately it's the United States who will blink first,\" said Neil Thomas, a fellow for Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis",
      "Xi's view is that countries will want to do business less with the U.S. because of the uncertainty created by tariffs, which will drive them toward China, said Thomas, who added that China has been preparing for this possibility for years by growing trade relations with the rest of the world.",
      "\"Both Washington and Beijing think they hold the stronger hand for different reasons. The Trump administration sees China as export-dependent, so they believe it's significant leverage to get the Chinese to bend,\" Blanchette said. \"On the other hand, Beijing sees the U.S. as increasingly economically weak under Trump and distanced from its allies.\"",
      "While Trump in his Cabinet meeting on Thursday called Xi a \"friend\" and said he'd love to strike a deal with China, the calculus isn't so simple for Xi. If Xi walks away from the phone call without a deal, he risks losing face.",
      "\"For Xi, there's a huge amount of risk of looking weak in his dealings with the U.S. He risks being humiliated or not having anything to show for his engagement with Trump,\" Thomas said. \"The tariffs will be economically painful, but Xi also sees this as an opportunity to get China into a healthier situation by reducing reliance on the U.S.\"",

      "Over 1,300 federal employees impacted by the Department of Education's March 11 reduction in force received their official separation notices Thursday, according to copies reviewed by ABC News.",
      "\"It is with great regret that I must inform you that your position is being abolished and you have been reached for reduction in force (RIF) action,\" the notices read, in part.",
      "The RIF was one of the first major steps in massively reducing the Education Department after President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to close the agency on March 20.",
      "Both Trump and McMahon have suggested they will continue reducing the size of the agency and return education power and decisions to the states.",
      "The president has said that the RIF'd employees either weren't showing up to work or they weren't good at their jobs. But the notices explained that the separation is not based on performance evaluations -- it is due to the \"reduction in the number of positions\" at the agency. The notices also said that employees have the right to appeal this reduction.",
      "In addition, laying off people without going through the civil service protections is \"illegal,\" according to NAACP Chief of Policy and Legislative Affairs Patrice Willoughby.",
      "\"What they're doing is illegal,\" Willoughby told ABC News. \"They know it's illegal. It creates damage to people. They're damaging not only what they say is the deep state \u2014 really dedicated federal workers who are working professionally on behalf of education families and young people but they're also damaging these families and these kids in these communities, many of them who voted for this administration and the constituents of these senators and representatives, who are saying nothing about it.\"",
      "The letter sent on Thursday is a required 60-day notice alerting federal employees of their final days, according to a source familiar with the matter. Until those 60 days are up, the affected employees are on paid administrative leave. On June 10, they will no longer be employed.",
      "\"ED appreciates the service you have rendered,\" the notice said, adding, \"We deeply regret that this decision affects you, and we recognize the difficulty of the moment.\"",
      "Last month the department announced that about half of its 4,000-plus employees were eliminated either through its reduction, voluntary separations or retirements. Dozens more probationary employees were let go -- and then rehired after a court order overturned the administration's terminations.",

      "Over the past month, the impacted civil servants have cleaned out their offices \u2013 if they worked in person \u2013 and are no longer allowed in the Education Department's buildings. They have no work responsibilities, and they do not have access to emails or systems and servers.",
      "Civil servants who shared the notices with ABC News said the letters make the reduction feel \"more real.\"",

      "Another department employee whose entire office was eliminated said that they feel numb.",

      "The government cited a two-page memo signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Lawyers for Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil argued on Thursday that the government did not present evidence to prove that his presence in the U.S. poses an adverse foreign policy consequence, which the Trump administration has argued is the ground for his deportation from the U.S.",
      "Khalil is scheduled to appear before an immigration judge in Louisiana on Friday, a hearing that comes after the judge gave the government a deadline earlier this week to present evidence to back up several allegations made against Khalil, including that he misrepresented information on his green card application.",
      "Khalil was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at his Columbia housing last month. He is a green card holder and legal permanent resident married to an American citizen, who is nine months pregnant.",

      "The memo makes no mention of previous allegations that he misrepresented information on his green card application and instead doubles down on an obscure section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that deems migrants deportable \"if the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe that the alien's presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "The two-page memo also makes the case for why another person, whose name is redacted, should be deportable under the same arguments.",
      "In the memo, Rubio asserts he has the power to determine a person is deportable even if their actions are \"otherwise lawful.\"",
      "Rubio wrote that Khalil should be deported because of his alleged role in \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities, which fosters a hostile environment for Jewish students in the United States.\"",
      "Marc Van Der Hout, one of Khalil's attorneys, sharply criticized the memo during a Zoom press conference on Thursday.",
      "Rubio \"talks about First Amendment activity in the United States and the effect on people in the U.S. His 'determination' has absolutely nothing to do with foreign policy.\"",
      "Van Der Hout also described as \"bogus\" the earlier allegations about alleged misrepresentations on Khalil's visa application and regarding negotiations he was involved in with Columbia over the student encampment.",
      "\"But it is zero to do with the foreign policy charge, and there is zero support for the government's allegations about any misrepresentation,\" Van Der Hout said. \"We're not concerned with that at all.\"",
      "Khalil's attorneys said they don't believe the government has presented any evidence to suggest he should be removable under the Immigration and Nationality Act.",
      "The case could set the precedent that the government can silence its critics and remove them, in what can become \"a dangerous slope,\" Van Der Hout said.",
      "\"What the Rubio letter talks about is they're trying to protect -- they say -- Jewish people in the United States, from antisemitism. But what is the antisemitism? It is criticizing Israel and the United States for the slaughtering that is going on in Gaza and Palestine,\" Van Der Hout said.",
      "\"That's what this case is about, and that's what this case is really centered on, the rights of people in this country, citizens and immigrants alike -- who are all protected by the Constitution, by the First Amendment -- to be able to speak out whatever their views may be, popular or not,\" Van Der Hout said.",
      "Khalil's lawyers plan to request to depose Rubio in court to understand what grounds he had to make the determination that Khalil's presence in the US poses a risk to U.S. foreign policy interests.",
      "The immigration judge has said she will make a finding on whether Khalil is removable on Friday, according to Khalil's attorneys.",
      "\"But we are far from the end of the road if that happens,\" Johnny Sinodis, a lawyer and partner at Van Der Hout who is representing Khalil, said Thursday. If the immigration judge determines that Khalil is, in fact, removable, the case will move into a next phase but Khalil can still litigate his right to remain in the U.S.",
      "\"This process plays out in immigration court, and it will most certainly require several more hearings before a final decision can be made in the immigration case,\" Sinodis said.",

    "story": [
      "Kennedy said he believes as many as 1 in 31 children have autism.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made a significant commitment at Thursday's Cabinet meeting at the White House, saying that his agency will \"know what has caused the autism epidemic\" by September.",
      "Kennedy said that HHS had launched, at President Donald Trump's direction, a large research effort involving \"hundreds of scientists from around the world\" to look into the rising rates of autism diagnoses.",
      "\"At your direction, we are going to know by September,\" Kennedy said. \"We've launched a massive testing and research effort that's going to involve hundreds of scientists from around the world.\"",
      "\"In September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be able to eliminate those exposures,\" he added.",
      "Trump commended Kennedy on the September goal, speculating -- without scientific backing -- that the answer to driving down rates could be \"you stop taking something, you stop eating something or maybe it's a shot, but something's causing it.\"",
      "Kennedy and Trump have both made it a priority to understand what's causing the rise in autism rates in the U.S.",
      "Scientists have been studying the cause of autism for decades, and have identified genetics and several other factors as possibly playing a role.",
      "It is true that estimated autism rates have climbed in the past 20 years, however experts say these rising rates are likely largely due to better awareness, a wide definition of autism spectrum disorder, and better access to services, leading to more children being screened and diagnosed. It's possible that a yet-unknown factor is also contributing to the increase.",
      "In 2000, approximately 1 in 150 children in the U.S. born in 1992 were diagnosed with autism. By 2020, 1 in 36 children born in 2012 were diagnosed, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "At the Cabinet meeting, Kennedy said that he believes those rates have risen, per new data to be released, to 1 in 31 children.",
      "In a later interview on Fox News' \"The Story with Martha MacCallum,\" Kennedy said the National Institutes of Health would oversee the study and that it would look into \"everything.\"",
      "\"We\u2019re going to look at everything. Everything is on the table -- our food system, our water, our air, we will find out what\u2019s triggering this epidemic,\" Kennedy said. \"We know it is an environmental toxin that is causing this cataclysm. Through research at NIH, we will find an answer to this question.\"",
      "In his confirmation hearing, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya said he \"fully\" supported childhood vaccination and didn't \"generally believe\" there was a link between vaccines and autism. But he said finding answers on the rise in autism cases generally was a vital public health goal.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, chairman of the Senate health committee, encouraged Bhattacharya to look into autism rates, but strongly dissuaded him and Kennedy from \"plow[ing] the barren ground\" of investigating vaccines and autism, because it had already been debunked \"multiple times.\"",
      "\"If we\u2019re pissing away money over here, that\u2019s less money that we have to actually go after the true reason,\" Cassidy, a doctor, told Bhattacharya during his hearing.But Kennedy has also brought on a well-known vaccine skeptic, David Geier, to study the connection between vaccines and autism, the Washington Post and New York Times have reported.",
      "The concern, experts say, is that while investing more into research could provide answers, Kennedy has also frequently raised the question of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccines as a link, despite dozens of studies debunking the claim.",
      "The elevated platform for vaccine hesitancy poses a particular risk as hundreds of measles cases are spreading across western Texas, largely in unvaccinated communities, and two unvaccinated school-aged children have died.",
      "Despite Kennedy's efforts to investigate vaccines and autism, he said in an interview with CBS News on Wednesday that he encouraged vaccination, a notably supportive departure from some of Kennedy's past comments.\"The government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine,\" he said, though added that it shouldn't be mandated.",

      "Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., sent a letter to Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Thursday asking for an investigation into potential conflicts of interest over the actions that took place Wednesday.",
      "Hours before Trump announced he was rolling back tariffs to 10% to all countries except China, which sent the stock market soaring, he posted on Truth Social: \"BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!\" and \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT.\"",
      "\"This sequence of events raises grave legal and ethics concerns. The President, his family, and his advisors are uniquely positioned to be privy to and take advantage of non-public information to inform their investment decisions,\" the senators said in their letter.",
      "Stocks were down Wednesday morning before Trump's Truth Social post immediately caused markets to spike. Nasdaq soared 12.1% at close, the index's largest single-day gain since 2021, while the Dow jumped 7.8%, its biggest one-day increase in five years.",
      "The White House has not immediately commented.",
      "The senators asked the Office of Government Ethics to probe whether any White House or executive branch officials, to include special government employees, were informed of the announcement in advance and what financial transactions were made by officials with knowledge of nonpublic information.",
      "The senators also said they wanted answers to several questions about Wednesday's chain of events, including whether any Trump's family members were informed of the deliberations prior to Trump's Truth Social post announcing the tariff changes and if there were any records of communications with executive branch officials, family members or special government employees.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that the president's decision was part of his plan and that 75 countries had called to negotiate with the president. They did not provide further details.",
      "Hours later, however, Trump told reporters he made his decision Wednesday morning.",
      "\"I think it probably came together early this morning, fairly early this morning. Just wrote it up. I didn't -- we didn't have the use of, we didn't have access to lawyers, or it was just brought up. We wrote it up from our hearts,\" he said.",
      "Michael Guttentag, a Loyola Law School professor who has written several research papers on insider trading, told ABC News there is no universal national insider trading law. Rather, cases have been prosecuted, generally, through court decisions that have set precedents.",
      "\"Generally, the other issue is the standard test for insider trading is, 'Did you have material nonpublic information?,'\" he told ABC News.",
      "However, in 2012, Congress passed the Stock Act of 2012, which made it illegal for Congress members and anyone part of the executive branch to take part in insider trading.",
      "Guttentag said it would not be hard to determine if insider trading took place within the White House as one would just need to start by pulling up the trading records, match them with individuals linked to the executive office and the time Trump's announcement was made.",
      "He noted former U.S. Rep. Chris Collins was prosecuted on insider trading in 2018 after the Office of Congressional Ethics determined he used his congressional connections to inform his son to sell stocks of a pharmaceutical company that was about to get information on a drug trial. Investigators were able to determine Collins made the call to his son while at a picnic at the White House almost immediately after he received the e-mail about the failed drug trial.",
      "He ultimately resigned from his seat and pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2019 but was pardoned by Trump in December 2020.",
      "Guttentag said the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission would be in charge of investigating the civil and criminal allegations of potential violations of the 2012 Stock Act.",
      "While Trump and other officials declined to talk more about Schiff and Gallego's request, some other Democratic senators at the Capitol on Thursday also questioned the timing of the announcement and the rise in stocks.",
      "\"Look, it shouldn't be an investigation by Democrats or Republicans, it should be an independent investigation. And if the president and his cabinet and his family have nothing to hide, they should want an investigation like that. Let's just clear up the smoke here,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., told reporters.",
      "\"Over and over again we see evidence of self-dealing and efforts to improve your bottom-line net worth with the policies of this administration,\" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said. \"I think it deserves closer scrutiny.\"",
      "But some Republicans dismissed the concern.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, called the assertion of insider trading \"ridiculous\" and said Democrats were just looking to \"take a dig\" at Trump.",
      "\"It's pretty obvious that when the stock market is in a dip that maybe if you have some money, you might consider investing and make some money when it picks back up again. I think any idea of insider trading is ridiculous,\" Cornyn told reporters.",
      "Guttentag noted investigating possible insider trading within the executive branch and prosecuting them if there any solid evidence is a long hill to climb. However, he said it is imperative that ethics rules are followed.",
      "\"People tend to find insider trading reprehensible. If [investigators] could share evidence that people were trading in this window, it would be important in establishing transparency and keeping the rule of law,\" he said.",

      "Ackman took to social media early Wednesday, asking Trump to put a 90-day pause on tariffs, arguing the president can \"accomplish his objectives without destroying small businesses in the short term.\"",
      "In a lengthy post on X, Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, issued a dire warning of what could happen if the tariffs weren't halted immediately.",

      "Musk has publicly blasted Trump's senior trade adviser Peter Navarro, one of the architects of Trump's tariff policy, calling him \"truly a moron\" and \"dumber than a sack of bricks\" after Navarro described him as a \"car assembler.\" In a live stream speech to Italy's League Congress Conference in Florence, Italy, on Saturday, Musk expressed hope for the U.S. and Europe to create \"a very close, stronger partnership\" and reach a \"zero-tariff\" policy soon.",
      "A 10% tariff on all U.S. trading partners went into effect on Saturday. Additional reciprocal tariffs against more than 60 countries that place duties on U.S. imports went into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday.

      "The pause would not apply to China, however, because government officials there were unwilling to make a deal, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "Trump had already raised tariffs on China to 104% after China refused to back down from imposing a 34% tariff on U.S. goods. On Wednesday, China responded by jacking up tariffs on U.S. products to 84%, prompting Trump to tack on an additional 21%, bringing China's tariff to 125%.",
      "European Union countries on Wednesday backed the European Commission\u2019s proposal to push back on Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum with a set of countermeasures.",
      "Ackman spoke out against tariffs, saying he is \"receiving an increasing number of emails and texts from small business people I do business or have invested in, expressing fear that they will not be able to pass on their increased costs to their customers and will suffer severely negative consequences.\"",
      "In his post Wednesday, Ackman shared an email from the founder of a cold brew coffee business he said he received before China's announced retaliatory tariffs. The cold brew coffee founder said his cost for glass bottles sourced from China will go up 50%, while chai sourced from India will increase by 26% and coffee imported from Ethiopia, Peru and Canada will climb by 10%.",
      "\"Will my clients tolerate a near doubling of their contract costs overnight, or will they expect me to absorb the increases my vendors are already threatening?\" the business owner wrote in the email to Ackman. \"If clients resist price hikes and my employees demand higher wages to offset their rising cost of living, we end up in a lose-lose scenario -- no spending and no jobs.\"",
      "Ackman ended his post by writing, \"May cooler heads prevail.\"",
      "Following Trump's announcement that he was pausing tariffs on most countries, Ackman issued a series of new posts on X, including one saying, \"This was brilliantly executed by @realDonald Trump. Texbook, Art of the Deal.\"",
      "\"The benefit of @realDonaldTrump\u2019s approach is that we now understand who are our preferred trading partners, and who the problems are. China has shown themselves to be a bad actor,\" Ackman said in a post. \"Our counterparties also have a taste of what life is like if they don\u2019t take down their trade barriers.\"",

CQ Brown Jr., the second Black general to serve as chairman, as part of his Republican administration\u2019s campaign to rid the military of leaders who support diversity and equity in the ranks. The Senate confirmed Caine 60-25 in an overnight vote before heading home for a two-week recess.",
      "Caine is a decorated F-16 combat pilot who served in leadership in multiple special operations commands, in some of the Pentagon\u2019s most classified programs and in the CIA. But he does not meet prerequisites for the job set out in a 1986 law, such as being a combatant commander or service chief. Those requirements can be waived by the president if there is a determination that \u201csuch action is necessary in the national interest.\"",

      "\u201cGeneral Caine has served our nation with distinction in the Air Force and Air National Guard, including over multiple combat deployments,\" Schumer said. \"Now, as our nation\u2019s top military advisor, I hope he will continue to fight for the needs of our servicemembers, speak truth to power, and resist Donald Trump when he\u2019s wrong.\u201d",
      "Still, the vote was bipartisan, with 15 Democrats and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine voting in support of Caine's nomination.",
      "At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Caine said he would be candid in his advice to Trump and vowed to be apolitical. Caine disputed Trump\u2019s story that Caine wore a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat when the two first met.",
      "\u201cI have never worn any political merchandise,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked how he would react if ordered to direct the military to do something potentially illegal, such as being used against civilians in domestic law enforcement, he told senators that it is \u201cthe duty and the job that I have\u201d to push back.",
      "Trump\u2019s relationship with Caine dates to his first administration. They met during a trip to Iraq, as Trump recounted in a 2019 speech. He has said Caine is \u201ca real general, not a television general.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump\u2019s relationship with then-Chairman Gen. Mark Milley soured as Milley pushed back and took steps to try to prevent what he saw as an attempt to politicize the office. Milley would remind military service members that they took an oath to the Constitution, not to a president.",
      "Within hours of Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, Milley\u2019s portrait as chairman of the Joint Chiefs was removed from the Pentagon. Milley\u2019s security clearance and security detail also were revoked.",

      "The U.S. Department of Justice is ending a settlement agreement with Alabama regarding wastewater problems in a rural Alabama county where most residents are Black",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- The U.S. Department of Justice announced Friday that it is ending a settlement agreement regarding wastewater problems in a rural Alabama county where most residents are Black, closing an environmental justice probe launched by the Biden administration.",
      "Justice Department officials said they were ending the agreement reached with the state regarding wastewater issues in Lowndes County. Federal officials said the decision follows President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order forbidding federal agencies from pursuing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "\u201cThe DOJ will no longer push \u2018environmental justice\u2019 as viewed through a distorting, DEI lens,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division said in a statement.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump made it clear: Americans deserve a government committed to serving every individual with dignity and respect, and to expending taxpayer resources in accordance with the national interest, not arbitrary criteria,\" the statement said.",
      "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in February issued a memo rescinding a Biden-era directive to prioritize environmental justice cases.",
      "Wastewater sanitation issues are well-documented in Lowndes County. Poverty, inadequate infrastructure and a type of soil that makes it difficult for traditional septic tanks to work have sometimes left some residents with sewage in their yards.",
      "The Justice Department in 2023 said its probe found Alabama engaged in a pattern of inaction and neglect regarding the risks of raw sewage for county residents. The Alabama Department of Public Health agreed to take several steps as part of the settlement, including not fining people with inadequate home systems, creating a comprehensive plan for the region and other steps.",
      "The agreement was the result of the Justice Department's first environmental justice investigation under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",
      "U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, a Democrat whose district includes the county, criticized the decision to end the agreement.",
      "\u201cIt was about addressing a public health crisis that has forced generations of children and families to endure the health hazards of living in proximity to raw sewage, as the DOJ itself documented,\" Sewell said.",
      "She said that the Trump administration \"has put its blatant disregard for the health of my constituents on full display.\u201d",
      "Dr. Scott Harris, Alabama\u2019s state health officer, said his department will continue its work in the region. But he noted that work and efforts to help install new septic systems at homes is dependent upon federal and state funding. American Rescue Plan funds helped provide money for new septic system installations.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change our intent to help as many people as possible,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe real question is going to be what the funding situation looks like.\u201d",
      "Catherine Flowers, an activist who brought attention to the problem in the county, said wastewater sanitation is a problem in many rural areas.",
      "\u201cI pray that today\u2019s action means that this administration will make sanitation a priority for all who are affected throughout rural America,\u201d Flowers said.",

      "SALEM, Ore. -- Oregon's DMV says it has found new cases of people being registered to vote despite not showing proof of U.S. citizenship, as it continues to review voter registration records following the disclosure of the errors last fall.",
      "A DMV report released Thursday revealed 118 new cases, in addition to the roughly 1,600 known cases of people who didn't show proof of citizenship yet were registered to vote. Nearly all of the newfound errors, or 111 cases, involved people whose information was entered into a previous computer system that was in place between 2010 and 2020.",
      "In total, the technical and clerical errors are so far known to have resulted in 1,739 people being mistakenly registered to vote, according to the Secretary of State's office, which said many were later confirmed to be citizens. As of this month, the office has determined that only 30 of those people voted in an election \u2014 a tiny fraction of the state's roughly 3 million registered voters.",
      "The Secretary of State\u2019s elections division investigated the 30 cases, according to the office's webpage on the DMV automatic voter registration errors. Eight cases were closed, 19 are still under active investigation by the office and three were referred to the Oregon Department of Justice for further investigation.",
      "Most of the clerical errors stemmed from a drop-down menu option in the DMV's computer system that staff used when entering personal information, according to authorities.",
      "\u201cNone of these people intended to register, represented themselves as eligible to vote, or made any claim to U.S. citizenship. We are sorry for the error and want to be clear that the people mistakenly registered bear no responsibility for it,\u201d the Secretary of State's webpage says.",
      "The DMV has been reviewing records and issuing monthly reports since the errors were revealed last fall. The mistakes occurred in part because Oregon allows some residents who aren\u2019t citizens to obtain driver\u2019s licenses, and the state\u2019s so-called \u201cMotor Voter\u201d law automatically registers most people to vote when they seek a new license or ID.",
      "The DMV will continue sampling Motor Voter data on a monthly basis through 2025. Both the department and the Secretary of State's office say they have put new controls in place to prevent the error from occurring.",
      "The DMV resumed automatic voter registrations in February after Gov. Tina Kotek had ordered a pause because of the errors.",

      "But amid the laughing emojis, LOLs and people simply posting \u201chuh,\u201d there has been a lot of interest from price-conscious parents as U.S. egg prices increased again last month to reach a new record high of $6.23 per dozen. Relief could be coming: There is evidence that prices are falling, and grocery stores may start offering discounts to get shoppers in the door.",
      "But even with all that, egg prices are higher than ever. That has the idea of coloring potatoes or rocks, which first made the rounds after a 2023 spike in prices, making a resurgence.",
      "One video that is circulating shows a grinning mom filling cupcake tins with dye. Her child then skewered marshmallows with toothpicks before gently lowering them into the dye and proudly displaying the creations on a glass platter. Another influencer created marshmallow chicks by dipping marshmallows in yellow food coloring, dabbing dots of black icing to create eyes and and then attaching orange M&Ms for a nose and feet.",

      "For many families like Friedl's, dyeing eggs isn\u2019t so much about eating eggs. That meant having some go bad in the fridge wasn\u2019t such a big deal when a dozen cost less than $2, as they consistently did for years, outside the 2015 bird flu outbreak and the current one. But not now.",
      "Paas, a supplier of egg dyeing kits, said that while 94% of those who celebrate Easter will dye eggs this year, 78% of families said they would dye fewer of them than in past years due to the expense.",
      "The craft retailer Michaels said their craft egg kits are flying off the shelves. Sales of two of the kits are up 20% compared to the same time last year, said Melissa Mills, senior vice president and general merchandising manager at Michaels.",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, declined to comment on sales of dyeable plastic eggs and other alternatives, but said it wasn\u2019t the first year it carried them.

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration's move to classify thousands of living immigrants as dead and cancel their Social Security numbers is an escalation of the president's crackdown on people who were legally allowed to live in the U.S. under programs instituted by his predecessor.",
      "The move will make it much harder for affected immigrants to use banks or other basic services where Social Security numbers are required.",
      "The White House says that \u201cby removing the monetary incentive for illegal aliens to come and stay, we will encourage them to self-deport.\u201d",
      "However, the affected individuals newly added to the Social Security Administration's \u201cDeath Master File\u201d are in the country legally. Immigrant advocates say the administration is committing \"digital murder.\"",
      "Here's what we know about the administration's plan to note some immigrants as dead in Social Security data:",
      "A Trump administration official said the SSA moved roughly 6,300 immigrants\u2019 names and Social Security numbers to a database that federal officials normally use to track the deceased after the Department of Homeland Security identified them as temporarily paroled aliens on the terrorist watch list or with FBI criminal records.",
      "The administration has not provided evidence of this assertion.",
      "The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, known as the Death Master File. It contains more than 142 million records going back to 1899.",
      "In its latest move, the White House has taken to referring to it as the \u201cIneligible Master File.\"",
      "Effective April 8, Customs and Border Patrol terminated parole for all these individuals with written notice to each of them, the Trump administration official said. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and discussed the development on condition of anonymity.",
      "Without a Social Security number, you cannot legally get a job, collect Social Security benefits or receive certain government benefits. Some school districts may prevent children from enrolling in school without a Social Security number.",
      "And while some banks allow people to open an account without a Social Security number, stripping immigrants of their Social Security numbers will cut them off from many other financial services.",
      "Devin O\u2019Connor, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that the move is unprecedented and that never before have people been deliberately added to death rolls when they are still alive.",
      "\u201cThe administration is saying they have the right to declare someone as dead when they have not died \u2014 where is the oversight here?\" O'Connor asked. \u201cAnd what happens when they make a mistake?\u201d",
      "Former Social Security Administrator Martin O\u2019Malley told The Associated Press, \u201cThe police state is here, now.\u201d The administration's latest move violates privacy rules meant to protect everyone's personal data, he said.",
      "Experts warn that the targeting of immigrants could just be the beginning.",
      "O'Connor said, \u201cThe idea that you can rename the Death Master File and decide you can put people on the list as persona non grata\" is unheard of and should concern everyone.",
      "\u201cIf they can do it to one group, they can do it to anyone \u2014 in error or in malice,\u201d Kathleen Romig, the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, posted on the BlueSky social media app Thursday.",
      "\u201cA person must be (asterisk)lawfully admitted(asterisk) to the U.S. to be assigned a Social Security number,\u201d she said in another post.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let the Trump Administration gaslight you. Their \u2018digital murder\u2019 policy isn\u2019t about undocumented immigrants. It\u2019s about people who came here legally.\u201d",
      "Earlier this week, DHS revoked the legal status of hundreds of thousands of immigrants who used the CBP One app. They had generally been allowed to remain in the U.S. for two years with work authorization under presidential parole authority during the Biden era but are now expected to self-deport.",
      "Additionally, DHS and the Treasury Department signed a deal this week that would allow the IRS to share immigrants\u2019 tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the purpose of identifying and deporting people illegally in the U.S. The agreement will allow ICE to submit names and addresses of immigrants inside the U.S. illegally to the IRS for cross-verification against tax records.",
      "The acting IRS commissioner, Melanie Krause, who had served in that capacity since February, stepped down over that deal.",
      "Advocates say the Treasury-DHS information-sharing agreement violates privacy laws and diminishes the privacy of all Americans.",

      "North Carolina\u2019s Supreme Court has ruled that tens of thousands of cast ballots challenged by the trailing candidate in November\u2019s election for a seat on the court must remain in the election count",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina\u2019s Supreme Court ruled on Friday that tens of thousands of cast ballots challenged by the trailing candidate in November\u2019s unresolved election for a seat on the court must remain in the election count.",
      "The decision partially overturns last week\u2019s ruling by a panel of the intermediate-level Court of Appeals that had favored Republican Jefferson Griffin, who closely trails Democratic Associate Justice Allison Riggs.",
      "But a majority of justices \u2014 all registered Republicans \u2014 agreed with the lower court that additional ballots from two other categories that Griffin contested were wrongly allowed in the tally. Some of these voters \u2014 potentially thousands who serve in the military or live overseas \u2014 would still get a chance to turn in a photo identification or an ID exception form for their choice in the race to remain in the count, the court's prevailing order says.",
      "The Supreme Court\u2019s order isn\u2019t expected to fully resolve the close race between Griffin and Riggs, who leads Griffin by 734 votes from more than 5.5 million ballots cast in their race. It\u2019s the only 2024 election in the country that is still undecided.",
      "It\u2019s also unknown whether the outstanding ballots that could ultimately get taken out of the count could flip the result to Griffin, himself a current Court of Appeals judge. Griffin did not sit on the three-judge panel whose majority ruled for him last week, and Riggs did not participate in the Supreme Court deliberations.",
      "Riggs' attorneys filed a motion late Friday in U.S. District Court in Raleigh asking a judge to issue an injunction preventing the state appeals court decisions from being carried out immediately.",
      "Riggs and the State Board of Elections, which had previously thrown out Griffin's formal protests of more than 65,000 ballots covering three categories, had signaled plans to return to federal court if necessary, should the justices side with Griffin to potentially plead violations of federal elections and voting rights laws.",
      "The largest category of challenged voters \u2014 roughly 60,000 \u2014 included ballots cast last fall by people who have been registered to vote since 2004, but their records lack a driver\u2019s license number or the last four digits of a Social Security number.",
      "Friday\u2019s prevailing opinion said the Court of Appeals got it wrong by declaring these ballots shouldn't have been counted. That's because, according to the opinion, the blame rests with the State Board of Elections for failing for years to properly collect those numerical identifiers, not the voters. These voters ultimately proved their identity by complying with the state's new photo ID law, and longtime legal precedent says such mistakes by election officials cannot result in cast votes being voided, the order reads.",
      "\u201cAccordingly, we cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that the Board erred by counting their ballots,\u201d the order says. The Court of Appeals ruling on the registrations, had it been upheld, also would have given these voters about three weeks to provide identifying numbers that if verified would mean their ballots would have counted.",
      "A majority of the six justices participating in the case declined to alter the bulk of the portion of the Court of Appeals ruling that determined ballots from a category of military or overseas voters who did not provide copies of photo identification or ID exception forms were ineligible. But instead of giving 15 business days to these voters to provide an ID or form to keep them eligible, the prevailing order directed a \u201ccure\u201d deadline in 30 calendar days.",
      "And the high court kept in place the Court of Appeals ruling that those in the third category \u2014 potentially hundreds of overseas voters who have never lived in the U.S. \u2014 were ineligible based on state residency laws to cast ballots and their choices must be removed from the totals.",
      "Attorneys for Riggs and the board have said the votes challenged by Griffin were lawfully cast by voters based on the rules in place for the November election and should remain in the count.",
      "Riggs said in a news release that while she was gratified that the justices reversed a large portion of the Court of Appeals decision, she wouldn't give up \"in my fight to protect the fundamental freedoms for which our military service members and their families have sacrificed so much.\u201d",
      "Griffin campaign spokesperson Paul Shumaker said Friday's ruling was \u201cconsistent with what we asked in our initial filing.\u201d",
      "Associate Justice Anita Earls, the only Democrat among the participating justices on Friday, entered a blistering opinion of nearly 40 pages. While agreeing that canceling the ballots based on registration issues would have been inappropriate, Earls wrote that the prevailing order, should it stand, otherwise \u201ccompels unequal treatment of North Carolina voters and infringes on their state constitutional right to vote.\u201d",
      "In another opinion, Republican Associate Justice Richard Dietz wrote the courts should have agreed to conduct a full-blown review of the appeal, then declare Griffin\u2019s claims could not be made to alter a past election. The Supreme Court held no oral arguments before Friday's decision.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is betting that a beleaguered Iran is so vulnerable following a tumultuous 18 months in the Middle East that it might finally be ready to abandon its nuclear program.",
      "The renewed push to solve one of the most delicate foreign policy issues facing the White House and the Mideast will begin in earnest Saturday when Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi gather in Oman.",
      "Trump says he prefers a diplomatic solution, even as he warns that Iran will face \u201cgreat danger\u201d if talks don't go well. But Iran's nuclear advances since Trump scrapped an Obama-era agreement during his first term make finding a pathway to a deal difficult, and experts warn that the prospects of U.S. military action on Iranian nuclear facilities appear higher than they have been in years.",
      "\u201cI want Iran to be a wonderful, great, happy country, but they can\u2019t have a nuclear weapon,\" Trump said Friday night aboard Air Force One as he flew to Florida for the weekend.",
      "The moment is certainly fraught, but the White House is seeing hopeful signs that the timing might be right. The push comes as Iran has faced a series of enormous setbacks that has ostensibly left Tehran in a weaker negotiating position.",
      "The military capabilities of Iranian-backed proxy forces Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been dramatically degraded by Israeli forces. U.S. airstrikes, meanwhile, targeting Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen have hit oil refineries, airports and missile sites.",
      "Israel also carried out strikes against Iran in October that damaged facilities linked to Tehran\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. And in December, Iran saw Syrian leader Bashar Assad \u2014 Tehran's closest Mideast ally \u2014 ousted after more than two decades in power.",
      "The leaders of the Islamic Republic also face domestic pressure as years of international sanctions have choked the economy. The U.S. Treasury Department announced a new round of sanctions earlier this week targeting five entities and an individual that American officials say play key roles in Iran's nuclear program.",
      "\u201cAll eyes are on Oman by Iranians following this very closely and potentially hoping that this would impact the state of the economy,\u201d said Negar Mortazavi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "But it remains to be seen if the U.S. can entice Iran with a big enough carrot for it to make concessions to meet Trump's demands that any potential deal go further in ensuring Tehran doesn't develop nuclear weapons than the agreement forged during Democratic President Barack Obama's administration.",
      "Under the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, Iran could only maintain a small stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67%. Today, it has enough to build multiple nuclear weapons if it chooses and has some material enriched up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels.",
      "At the meeting Saturday in Oman\u2019s capital city of Muscat, Iran will be represented by Araghchi and the United States by Witkoff. It's unclear if the two will speak directly.",
      "Trump has said the two sides will have \u201cdirect\u201d negotiations. But Iranian officials have insisted that the plan is for \u201cindirect talks,\u201d meaning an intermediary from Oman would shuttle messages between Witkoff's and Araghchi's teams holed up in different rooms.",
      "Either way, the decision for the two sides to talk \u2014 announced by Trump in the Oval Office this week alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 came as a bit of a surprise.",
      "Trump has been calling for direct talks while threatening \"consequences\" for Iran if it doesn't move to get a deal done.",
      "Iran, meanwhile, has given mixed signals about the utility of the talks, arguing that engaging would be useless under the shadow of threats.",
      "After Trump recently sent a letter to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, 85-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calling for direct negotiations, Tehran rejected the entreaty while leaving open the possibility of indirect negotiations.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian again pledged this week that Iran's \u201cnot after a nuclear bomb\u201d and even suggested Tehran could be open to the prospect of direct American investment in the Islamic Republic if the countries can reach a deal.",
      "That was a departure from Iran\u2019s stance after its 2015 nuclear deal, in which Tehran sought to buy American airplanes but in effect barred U.S. companies from coming into the country.",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz has said Trump wants the \u201cfull dismantlement\u201d of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s enrichment, that is weaponization, and that is its strategic missile program.\u201d",
      "But Trump left greater space for negotiations: \u201c The only thing that they can\u2019t have is a nuclear weapon,\" Trump told reporters as he met with his Cabinet secretaries Wednesday.",
      "Witkoff also has signaled that the administration could be amenable to a deal that is less than full nuclear disarmament.",
      "\u201cWhere our red line will be, there can\u2019t be weaponization of your nuclear capability,\u201d Witkoff said in a Wall Street Journal interview published Friday.",
      "Meanwhile, Netanyahu, who met with Trump on Monday, said he would welcome a diplomatic agreement along the lines of Libya\u2019s deal with the international community in 2003. The Israeli leader is known for his hawkish views on Iran and in the past has urged Washington to take military action against Iran.",
      "The Libya deal saw late dictator Moammar Gadhafi give up all of his clandestine nuclear program. Iran has insisted its program, acknowledged to the International Atomic Energy Agency, should continue.",
      "But Trump has notably not embraced Netanyahu's push for the Libya model, said Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, another Washington-based think tank.",

      "Carvalho said after asking to see the identifications of the agents, the principals at each school contacted the district\u2019s legal department, which sent representatives and dispatched school board police to the campuses. The federal officers then got in their vehicles and left.",

      "On Thursday, as the Congressional recess loomed, Bowser also issued an 11th-hour plea on the X social media platform, tagging both Trump and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, and warning the necessary cuts would \u201cimpact DC police overtime, firefighters, and programs for our kids ... The House should not recess until this bill is passed.\u201d",
      "Bowser also reposted Trump\u2019s own social media posting from late March, where he called on House leadership to pass the budget measure and \u201cget it done IMMEDIATELY.\u201d",
      "The crisis dates back to March, when the House passed a federal government funding bill that would force the district\u2019s government to revert to its 2024 budget parameters, effectively cutting $1.1 billion from its previously balanced budget midway through the financial year.",
      "Bowser spearheaded an intense congressional lobbying campaign to prevent the change, saying it would result in immediate across-the-board cuts to staffing and programs, including teachers and police officers being laid off.",
      "The Senate approved the funding bill with the cut but immediately followed up with a separate bill that would make the district\u2019s budget whole again. That fix then reverted back to the House for approval. But despite three weeks in session following Trump\u2019s appeal, and endorsements from both the police and firefighters unions, the House of Representatives failed to even bring the proposal to the floor for discussion.",
      "What happens next is unclear, but potentially dire. Bowser and D.C. officials have talked of layoffs among teachers and police officers and a scaling back of city services.",
      "D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson told reporters last week there is \u201cnot a hard and fast deadline\u201d for budget cuts, but he described the 2025 budget crisis as \u201ca vice that\u2019s closing ... At some point, the dollars are not going to be there and we will have to act.\u201d",
      "Bowser has mentioned \u201covertime spending for public safety officials\u201d \u2014 meaning fewer police on the street for less time. On Thursday, she said, \u201cif we have to make drastic cuts \u2026 It could affect some ways that we keep the city safe.\u201d",

      "The White House has hung a painting of President Donald Trump depicting a moment after an assassination attempt against him last summer \u2014 bumping the official portrait of one of his predecessors, Barack Obama",
      "WASHINGTON -- The White House on Friday hung a painting of President Donald Trump depicting a moment after an assassination attempt against him last summer \u2014 bumping the official portrait of one of his predecessors, Barack Obama.",
      "Hanging a new presidential likeness without advance notice is unusual, and Trump putting himself in that space could be seen as him breaking with norms yet again. By tradition, portraits of the two most recent former presidents go on display in the foyer \u2014 and Trump is in the unique position of also being a former president.",
      "Obama's portrait went on display in the foyer of the State Floor, near the staircase to the president's residence, after it was unveiled in 2022. The White House said it is still in the foyer, but has been moved to the opposite wall, where a portrait of former President George W. Bush used to hang.",
      "Plans are to move Bush\u2019s portrait nearer to his father\u2019s, former President George H.W. Bush, which is on the staircase to the residence.",
      "The White House announced the unexpected change in a post on its official account on X with a photo of the new painting that said, \u201cSome new artwork at the White House\u201d and a pair of emoji eyes. The painting captures the aftermath of an attempt on Trump's life during a July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was wounded in the ear and thrust his fist skyward as he said, \u201cfight, fight, fight!\u201d",
      "Those words became a key rallying cry of his successful reelection campaign.",
      "The original painting on canvas was done by artist Marc Lipp and was donated to the White House by Andrew Pollock via the Blue Gallery in Delray Beach, Florida, the White House said.",
      "Lipp\u2019s online biography as part of the Blue Gallery website describes him as \u201ca Modern Pop Art who translates his love for art through paintings and sculptures.\u201d Pollack is an author and school safety advocate whose daughter Meadow was among the students killed in the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.",
      "Regardless of party affiliation, the sitting president had often genially hosted his immediate predecessor for the unveiling of his portrait, but Trump did not extend that courtesy to Obama.",
      "It was left to then-President Joe Biden, and his wife, Jill, to welcome former President Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, to the White House for the unveiling of their portraits in 2022, as Democrat Bill Clinton did for Republican George W. Bush and the younger President Bush did for Clinton.",
      "The Obamas hosted George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, at the White House for their portrait unveiling in 2012.",
      "There was an unexplained pause when Trump did not host Obama during his first term.",
      "Biden left office nearly three months ago and it likely will be a few years before his and the former first lady's portraits are commissioned and completed.",
      "Trump has involved himself with paintings outside of the White House, too.",
      "Last month, a painting of Trump that had hung with other presidential portraits at the Colorado state Capitol was taken down after he complained that his likeness was \u201cpurposefully distorted.\u201d",
      "The White House portrait collection starts with George Washington, America\u2019s first president. Congress bought his portrait.",
      "Other portraits of early presidents and first ladies often came to the White House as gifts. Since the 1960s, the White House Historical Association has paid for most of the paintings. The first portraits financed by the association were of Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson, and John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy, said Stewart McLaurin, president of the private, nonprofit organization established by first lady Kennedy.",
      "President and first lady portraits are seen by millions of White House visitors, though not all are on display. Some are undergoing conservation or are in storage.",
      "Those on display line hallways and rooms in public areas of the mansion, such as the Ground Floor and its Vermeil and China Rooms, and the State Floor one level above, which has the famous Green, Blue and Red Rooms, the East Room and State Dining Room.",

      "The government\u2019s contention that Khalil\u2019s presence in the U.S. posed \u201cpotentially serious foreign policy consequences\u201d satisfied requirements for deportation, Immigration Judge Jamee E. Comans said at a hearing in Jena.",
      "Comans said the government had \u201cestablished by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable.\u201d",
      "After the immigration court hearing, Khalil attorney Marc Van Der Hout told a New Jersey federal judge that Khalil will appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals within weeks.",
      "\u201cSo nothing is going to happen quickly,\u201d he said.",
      "Addressing the judge at the end of the immigration hearing, Khalil recalled her saying at a hearing earlier in the week that \u201cthere's nothing more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness.\"",
      "\u201cClearly what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process,\u201d he added. \"This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to the court, 1,000 miles away from my family.\"",
      "Van Der Hout, also criticized the hearing's fairness.",
      "\u201cToday, we saw our worst fears play out: Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent,\" Van Der Hout said in a statement.",
      "Khalil, a legal U.S. resident, was detained by federal immigration agents March 8 in the lobby of his university-owned apartment, the first arrest under President Donald Trump\u2019s promised crackdown on students who joined campus protests against the war in Gaza.",
      "Within a day, he was flown across the country to an immigration detention center in Jena, far from his attorneys and wife, a U.S. citizen due to give birth soon.",
      "Khalil\u2019s lawyers have challenged the legality of his detention, saying the Trump administration is trying to block free speech protected by the First Amendment.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cited a rarely used statute to justify Khalil\u2019s deportation, which gives him power to deport those who pose \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d",
      "At Friday\u2019s hearing, Van Der Hout told the judge that the government\u2019s submissions to the court prove the attempt to deport his client \u201chas nothing to do with foreign policy\u201d and said the government is trying to deport him for protected speech.",
      "Khalil, a Palestinian born and raised in Syria after his grandparents were forcibly removed from their ancestral home in Tiberias, isn\u2019t accused of breaking any laws during the protests at Columbia.",
      "The government, however, has said noncitizens who participate in such demonstrations should be expelled from the country for expressing views that the administration considers to be antisemitic and \u201cpro-Hamas,\u201d referring to the Palestinian militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Khalil, a 30-year-old international affairs graduate student, had served as a negotiator and spokesperson for student activists at Columbia University who took over a campus lawn last spring to protest Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza.",
      "The university summoned police to dismantle the encampment after a small group of protesters seized an administration building. Khalil is not accused of participating in the building occupation and wasn\u2019t among those arrested.",
      "But images of his maskless face at protests and his willingness to share his name with reporters have drawn scorn from those who viewed the protesters and their demands as antisemitic. The White House accused Khalil of \u201csiding with terrorists\u201d but has yet to cite any support for the claim.",
      "Federal judges in New York and New Jersey have ordered the government not to deport Khalil while his case plays out in multiple courts.",
      "The Trump administration has said it is taking at least $400 million in federal funding away from research programs at Columbia and its medical center to punish it for not adequately fighting what it considers to be antisemitism on campus.",
      "Some Jewish students and faculty complained about being harassed during the demonstrations or ostracized because of their faith or their support of Israel.",
      "Immigration authorities have cracked down on other critics of Israel on college campuses, arresting a Georgetown University scholar who had spoken out on social media about the Israel-Gaza war, canceling the student visas of some protesters and deporting a Brown University professor who they said had attended the Lebanon funeral of a leader of Hezbollah, another militant group that has fought with Israel.",

      "In a letter dripping with sarcasm, Executive Director Jen Miller told Ohio Supreme Court justices she was certain that they chose the location of their new Women in the Law display \u2014 where retired Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor 's portrait would be the centerpiece \u2014 to emphasize the difficulties of being female.",
      "\u201cSituating the exhibit so far from the history-making action happening above ground also sends a powerful message about the distance women must travel to reach success,\" she wrote, \"inviting visitors to consider the fortitude required to make it out of the darkness of exclusion.\u201d",
      "O'Connor's portrait initially stood in the court\u2019s Grand Concourse, alongside an otherwise all male lineup. But it recently was removed amid disagreements about its placement among justices. Miller suggested that the court could commission a reproduction for use in the exhibit and return the original back upstairs.",
      "Among the issues that have arisen with the portrait, by artist Paul Wyse, is that its carved walnut frame is freestanding \u2014 so to be stood, rather than hung on a wall.",
      "Miller otherwise commended the conservative-leaning court for supporting such an exhibit as \u201cso many of those in leadership are abandoning expressions of diversity and inclusion,\u201d and said the league plans to widely promote it.",
      "O\u2019Connor, a Republican, sided with Democrats in a series of rulings finding GOP-drawn congressional and Statehouse maps unconstitutional, alienating many members of her own party. Last year, after retiring because of age limits, she became the face of a proposed constitutional amendment to change the troubled political mapmaking process. The measure failed in the face of forceful opposition from Ohio's Republican establishment.",
      "In its announcement, the court said the Women in the Law exhibit \u2014 to be located in the Thomas J. Moyer Judicial Center's \u201chistoric ground floor\u201d \u2014 will highlight women besides O'Connor, too.",
      "Other female trailblazers include Florence Allen, the first woman to serve on the Ohio Supreme Court and the first woman appointed to a federal court of appeals; and Melody Stewart, the first Black woman elected to the high court. Planned interactive displays would also bring to life the stories of former justices Alice Robie Resnick, Yvette McGee Brown and Evelyn Stratton, among others, the court said.",

      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- A proposal to designate the tortilla as New Mexico's official state bread had unanimous support from lawmakers. On Friday, though, it ended up falling flat.",
      "It wasn't because Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham isn't a fan of the round wraps that have long been a staple of Mexican, Central American and Southwestern U.S. cooking. It was because she believes lawmakers missed opportunities to debate bills that deal with weightier matters as the state faces extraordinary challenges.",

Georgia lawmakers recently passed a bill to recognize cornbread as their state\u2019s official bread.

And there\u2019s a proposal in California to name Bigfoot the state\u2019s official cryptid \u2014 a creature that has never been proven to exist.",

      "With the push to adopt the tortilla, which was proposed by Las Cruces fourth-grader Adaline McIntosh, lawmakers debated the kinds of flour needed for the perfect specimen. Their conclusion: It depends on the meal. They also got a history lesson from state Sen. Benny Shendo, a member of Jemez Pueblo tribe who explained that the first bread in what is now New Mexico was made by Pueblo people who cooked blue corn paste on a hot stone.",

      "Official state symbols date to the late 1800s, as legislatures throughout the U.S. sought to stake cultural claims and foster pride among their residents. First came flowers and flags. Then came fossils and foods, with the practice growing into a clever marketing tool to boost conversation and commerce.",
      "Oregon already has an official state nut, fruit and pie. But adopting the T-bone would recognize the role that cattle has played in the state\u2019s development and its contribution to the economy, supporters say.",

      "It is the last plant in the UK capable of producing virgin steel, which is used in major construction projects like new buildings and railways.",
      "Two huge blast furnaces are used to produce the steel, which has fewer imperfections than the recycled steel made elsewhere in the country.",
      "Were the plant to cease producing virgin steel, then the UK would become the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make it - a prospect the government views as a risk to the country's long-term economic security.",

      "The company was founded in 2016 when Tata Steel sold its loss-making long products division in Scunthorpe to private investment firm Greybull Capital for a token \u00a31.",
      "The new owners renamed the business British Steel.",

      "Jingye says the blast furnaces are no longer sustainable, blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with transitioning to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "The blast furnaces generate the extreme heat needed to produce virgin steel and are fuelled by coking coal and iron pellets - but supplies of those raw materials at the Scunthorpe plant are running low.",
      "That adds a time pressure to the British Steel talks because once a blast furnace shuts down, it is a costly and complex process to restart it again.",

      "The government has ordered MPs to return from their Easter breaks for an unusual weekend sitting in the Commons, as it weighs up options to protect the site.",

      "This intervention stops short of nationalisation - when a government takes ownership and control of a company - but Sir Keir said the government would do \"everything possible\" to \"protect\" the UK's steel industry.",
      "The prime minister's decision to announce emergency legislation follows tense talks between the government and Jingye earlier this week, which appear to have largely broken down.",
      "The government offered to buy the raw materials needed to keep the furnaces going but Jingye did not agree to that proposal.",

      "A key reason for this increase is climate change-related weather impacts on cacao farms, particularly in West Africa.",
      "Plus, some farmers in Ghana are turning away from cacao production in favour of illegal gold-mining, according to reports.",
      "It means that there was a deficit of roughly 500,000 tonnes of cocoa in the global market last year.",
      "Real chocolate could become a \"luxury\" item in the future says Massimo Sabatini, co-founder and chief executive of Italian firm Foreverland, which makes a cocoa powder alternative called Choruba.",
      "The company opened its production facility in March, where staff process not cacao beans but carob husks.",
      "Carob trees produce small, brown, banana-shaped pods containing seeds. It's possible to process the pods to create a cocoa-like powder. This chocolate alternative has a long history, however \u2013 and not a very happy one.",
      "A New Yorker article claims a generation was \"traumatized\" by carob-based confectionary during the 1970s. It didn't taste as good as real chocolate, and it didn't melt in your mouth in the same way, apparently.",
      "But Mr Sabatini insists that he and his colleagues have come up with a worthy product. He acknowledges that carob \"really doesn't taste like chocolate\" but adds that Foreverland's fermentation and roasting process removes some of the carob flavour to get it closer to cocoa.",
      "Their carob-based dark chocolate alternative is sweeter and more caramel-like than real dark chocolate, he explains.",
      "There could be health benefits to this. \"We can reduce drastically the sugar content,\" says Mr Sabatini. Carob is also higher in fibre and lower in fat than cocoa.",
      "German food manufacturer Planet A Foods has developed a different chocolate alternative. Sara Marquart, co-founder and chief technology officer, says her goal is not to replace chocolate but to help fill the gap in the market caused by volatility in cocoa availability and prices.",
      "Unlike Foreverland, Planet A Foods have chosen sunflower seeds as the key ingredient in their cocoa powder alternative, ChoViva.",
      "\"We process sunflower seeds like cocoa beans,\" explains Dr Marquart. \"It's a highly abundant ingredient, there's millions and millions of tonnes on the market.\"",
      "ChoViva is now present in roughly 35 different retail products, mostly on the market in Germany and France \u2013 though it also appears in mini egg-shaped sweets sold by Aldi in the UK. The sweets are made with peanuts and have a chocolate-like coating containing ChoViva.",
      "When I try them, the flavour is overwhelmingly dominated by the salty peanut at the egg's core. But the chocolatey texture of the coating is impressive. The same applies to ChoViva-covered biscuits made by the firm.",
      "I note that the chocolate-like coating is rather thin and not overly flavourful. But again, the texture is pretty much what you'd expect from real chocolate, though not quite as melty.",
      "The company's ChoViva-covered popcorn is probably the most chocolatey item I try \u2013 the popcorn doesn't usurp its coating.",
      "Overall, there's nothing here that would perturb a consumer. Especially one unaware that these products don't actually contain chocolate.",
      "A UK start-up also keen to compete in this space is Nukoko. Two of its founders previously ran a real chocolate business and teamed up with a food scientist to form their new venture.",
      "\"We saw first-hand the issues with the chocolate supply chain,\" says Ross Newton, co-founder. Like Foreverland and Planet A Foods, Nukoko has opted for a key ingredient that the firm can source and process locally \u2013 to reduce food miles and insulate against supply chain risks. But in Nukoko's case the raw material of choice is not carob or sunflower seeds but fava beans.",
      "\"There's around a million tonnes harvested in the UK every year,\" says Mr Newton.",
      "It's early days for the company but he adds that he hopes to begin selling their cocoa powder alternative to food firms later this year.",
      "Mr Newton says imitating the flavour of real chocolate is very hard but that, out of 25 crucial flavour compounds in real chocolate, his company's product manages to include 24 of them \u2013 though in some cases at slightly different concentrations.",
      "The company sends me four caramel-filled truffles to try. The caramel totally dominates and the truffles are very sweet. But the chocolate alternative is as smooth and glossy as you'd expect, and very satisfying to chew.",
      "\"Anything new that comes out has got to meet equal taste expectations,\" says Mr Caines, noting how discerning consumers are when it comes to their favourite chocolate-containing products. Getting them to embrace alternatives devoid of cocoa will be no mean feat.",
      "He adds that alternatives might fare best when used in bakery products \u2013 such as the chips in chocolate chip cookies: \"The chocolate is not so much the star of the show there so it might actually be more acceptable.\"",
      "Should chocolate alternatives meet with success, there is some risk that this could negatively impact cacao farmers, says Tonya Lander, a lecturer in biology at Oxford University.",
      "\"It's something that should be worked through with farmers or farmer collectives,\" she says. Cacao farmers are among the poorest agricultural workers in the world.",
      "Nukoko, Planet A Foods and Foreverland all say they don't aim to replace chocolate, rather, the goal is to fill the gap left by cocoa production shortfalls.",
      "Dr Lander and colleagues have studied environmental factors that influence yield from cacao trees.",
      "Poor pollination and high temperatures negatively affect how much cacao the trees produce, the researchers report in a study published in February.",
      "By shading cacao trees on plantations, for example, it might be possible to improve harvests and potentially reduce the volatility of cocoa supplies. Such interventions, besides switching to cocoa alternatives, could help satisfy confectionary-obsessed consumers in the coming years.",

    "story": [
      "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.",
      "The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.",
      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",
      "Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".",
      "Shipping agrees net-zero goal but critics unmoved",
      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water atoms to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",
      "Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.",

      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.",
      "\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",
      "It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken.",

      "By this reading, Trump's 4D game of chess has left China in check. Certainly the Chinese economy faces a massive hit from punitive tariffs in its biggest market. But even accounting for the President's roll back, the US has still erected a massive protectionist tariff wall, not seen since the 1930s.",
      "The world is left with a universal 10% tariff, irrespective of whether that country (for example the UK or Australia) actually sells less to the US than the US sells to it.",
      "There is now no difference between the EU, which clearly does have a massive trade deficit in goods and was preparing to retaliate, and the UK.",
      "There is also an anxious wait to find out what comes next. One of the questions is whether President Trump pushes ahead with tariffs on medicines, the UK's second biggest goods export.",
      "Plus there is potential logistical chaos on the cards from a little-noticed multi-million dollar port tax for every cargo vessel docking in the US that was \"made in China\". That is more than half of the global merchant fleet - and it is due next week.",
      "Even with Trump's stated 90 day pause on implementing higher tariffs, there remains too much uncertainty for companies to go through the rigmarole of rerouting global trade.",
      "The China fallout",
      "The central issue now, however, is that the world's two great economic superpowers are facing off against each other like rutting stags.",
      "Tariffs at these sky-high rates are massively hitting business between two nations which together account for around 3% of the entire world's trade. The main motorway of the global economy is effectively shut.",
      "The visible tangible consequences of all this will become very real very quickly: Chinese factories will close, workers will stroll from plant to plant looking for work.",

      "In theory this will be in sharp contrast to what is happening in other countries in the world. Across the border in Canada, or in Europe, not only will there not be such China-sourced price rises, there could be price cuts.",
      "From trade wars to currency wars",
      "Trade wars on this scale do not stay confined to the flow of goods. They tend to become currency wars.",
      "What we saw this week was the trade turmoil spread to credit markets, especially the US bond market, having already hit share prices.",
      "Indeed there was an invaluable reveal for the game theory of this conflict. The Trump administration revealed a key pressure point with its concern about the \"yippy\" - as Trump called it - bond market.",
      "As trading in US government debt continued overnight in Asia, the effective interest rate on these bonds rose to 5%.",
      "This sort of borrowing should not move in such an erratic fashion.",
      "The last time this happened was in the \"Dash for Cash\", the key moment of financial fragility at the very beginning of the pandemic. The world was focussed on life or death in March 2020, but this potential further crisis was alleviated only by emergency action.",
      "Effectively, the President's row back was a form of emergency policy change.",
      "Was the Chinese government behind this rash of US government bond sales in Asia? Probably not. However, what happened on Wednesday highlighted a vulnerability for Trump.",
      "China is the second biggest holder of US government debt in the world and if it chose to, dumping all that debt would be catastrophic for America. But doing so would be a form of mutually assured economic destruction - the losses for China would be huge.",
      "More importantly, what the bond markets were telling Trump is that they are deeply sceptical about his tariff policy.",
      "The US does have the Federal Reserve, which does have some power to tranquillise bond markets. But right now it does not look like its chairman Jerome Powell will ride to the rescue.",
      "The bond market scepticism echoes the sentiment of the ascendant Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. He is now pushing for Trump to reach trade deals with their allies because the US needs them to take on China.",
      "Given the US was previously calling these same close allies cheaters, looters and pillagers, there is no way this was the strategy all along.",
      "This does matter. The US needs the EU, UK, the rest of the G7 on side in terms of China. China probably needs those countries just to stay neutral, and carry on soaking up its exports.",
      "The rest of the world has seen Trump's team struggle to explain tariffing penguin islands or poor African economies and the President himself recirculating the suggestion he was crashing stock markets on purpose.

      "Almost at the same time as Trump posted his move on social media, Goldman Sachs issued a report predicting a recession in the US economy triggered by the steep duties.",

      "Government considers nationalising British Steel",
      "'Scunthorpe could become a disaster town'",
      "British Steel, which has been owned by China's Jingye since 2020, has said its two blast furnaces in Scunthorpe are \"no longer financially sustainable\".",
      "Jingye said it has invested more than \u00a31.2bn into British Steel to maintain operations and claims it suffered financial losses of around \u00a3700,000 a day.",

      "Mr Boyd said Scunthorpe's current blast furnaces produce \"the highest grade of steel available\".",
      "\"If we lose that capability we'll be wholly reliant on [countries] like China producing the blast furnace steel and electric arc furnaces, which make steel out of scrap, are all well and good but they're at least five years away,\" he said.",
      "It is very difficult and very expensive to get blast furnaces running again once they have been turned off, which would make the Scunthorpe site's existing vulnerability even more perilous.",

      "\"We're doing everything we can to preserve those jobs and to support those communities,\" she told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "But the chancellor would not guarantee whether the plant would be able to acquire fresh raw materials in time to keep the blast furnaces running.",
      "Asked to give such a guarantee, Reeves said: \"We are in active discussions now with both the owners and the trade unions.\"",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called on the government to nationalise the Scunthorpe plant, order the raw materials, and then seek a consortium to take over the running of it.",
      "\"Unless within three days that Scunthorpe plant is nationalised, those blast furnaces will go,\" he told BBC Breakfast.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump is ripping up the rulebook on trade that has been in place for more than 50 years.",
      "His latest round of sweeping tariffs, which came into force shortly after midnight on Wednesday, hits goods from some of America's biggest trading partners including China and the European Union with dramatic hikes in import duties.",
      "It provoked a dramatic retaliation from China, which ratcheted up its own tariffs on products imported from America - rapidly escalating the countries' latest trade war.",
      "The president and his allies say his tariffs are necessary to restore America's manufacturing base, which they view as essential to national security.",
      "But it remains a potentially seismic action, affecting more than $2tn (\u00a31.56bn) worth of imports, which will push the overall effective tariff rate in the US to the highest level in more than a century.",
      "In the US, key consumer goods could see huge price rises, including an estimated 33% for clothing, and analysts are warning of near-certain global economic damage as sales in America drop, trade shrinks and production abroad falls.",
      "As the global stock market reels, investors sell off their US government bonds and political pressure grows, the White House has worked to soothe nerves by floating the possibility of trade talks - touting conversations that have already begun with Japan, Vietnam and South Korea.",
      "But Trump has signalled resistance to the kinds of exemptions he granted during his first term, and even if these talks are ultimately productive, country-by-country deal-making will no doubt take time.",
      "\"The primary question... is whether or not there will be negotiations,\" said Thierry Wizman, a global strategist at the investment bank Macquarie. \"And no one has an answer to that because it's going to depend on the approach and the disposition of the negotiating parties.\"",

      "The US already appears set on a collision course with China -  its third biggest supplier of imports last year.",
      "Tensions intensified after the White House confirmed it was going ahead with its plan to increase the tax rates on products coming from China to 104%.",
      "Beijing hit back early Wednesday, saying it would also tax goods imported from the US at a new rate of 84%.",
      "In a statement before the new tariff rate was unveiled, a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington called Trump's moves \"bullying\" and warned that \"intimidation, threat and blackmail are not the right way to engage with China\".",
      "The rapid change has shaken US businesses with decades of ties to China, which now find themselves paralysed and unsure how this escalating trade fight might end.",
      "\"You would laugh if you weren't crying,\" said US businessman Jay Foreman, whose toy company Basic Fun! is known for classics such as Tonka Trucks and Care Bears, the vast majority of which are made in China.",
      "He put out notice to his suppliers to halt any shipments to the US earlier this week, as the US announced it would hit goods from China with duties starting at 104%.",
      "\"We just have to hold our shipments until this thing gets sorted out,\" he said. \"And if it doesn't get sorted out, them I'm going to sell down the inventory that I have in my warehouse and pray.\"",
      "Speaking to Congress on Tuesday, Jamieson Greer, who leads the office of the US Trade Representative, declined to set a timeline for how quickly talks might progress.",
      "\"The president is fixed in his purpose. This trade deficit and offshoring and the loss of jobs has persisted for too long,\" he said, while acknowledging the measures might lead to a \"challenging\" economic adjustment.",
      "\"It is a moment of drastic, overdue change, but I am confident the American people will rise to the occasion as they have done before,\" he said.",
      "US share prices have been on a downward slide for days. The S&P 500  is now trading at its lowest level in more than a year, after seeing roughly 12% of its value wiped out since the announcement last week.",
      "Stock markets from Japan to Germany have also been shaken, as investors assess the wider repercussions of the actions.  In the UK, the FTSE 100 has dropped about 10%.",
      "\"What I'm really seeing is trepidation, uncertainty, a lot of questions, a lot of people wanting us to predict what will happen next,\" said Amy Magnus, director of compliance and customs affairs for Deringer, a Vermont-based firm that is one of America's top five customs brokers. \"But I have entered into a world that I cannot predict.\"",
      "Erin Williamson, vice-president of US customs brokerage at GEODIS, a global supply chain operator, said on Tuesday afternoon that the uncertainty had prompted some of her firm's clients to simply put shipments on pause.",
      "\"One of the top ways that you can confirm that you're not putting your business at risk is really holding off until maybe the dust settles,\" she said.",
      "The uncertainty is raising the risks to the economy, said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics of the Budget Lab at Yale, which is not predicting a recession in the US, but still expects tariffs announced so far this year will cost the US 600,000 jobs and lead to a roughly $3,800 hit to purchasing power for the average household.",
      "\"A lot of the market turmoil we've seen is not about the substance of the economic damage of tariffs on their own. A lot of it is about the uncertainty,\" he said.",
      "\"Businesses and consumers don't know what the tariff rate is going to be an hour from now... How can you invest or make plans for the future in that environment?\"",
      "Mr Tedeschi said he saw no clear end to the trade war in sight.",
      "\"Even if the administration wanted to step back, how does it save face in a way that is mutually acceptable to all the relevant players?\" he said. \"That's becoming harder by the day.\"",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs targeting most of the world are now in effect \u2013 and outside China, no other region has been hit as hard as South East Asia.",
      "Near the top of the list are Vietnam and Cambodia which have been hit by some of the highest tariffs: 46% and 49%.  Further down are Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%) and Malaysia (24%). The Philippines gets a tariff of 17%, and Singapore of 10%.",
      "This is a huge blow for a region highly dependent on exports. Its widely admired economic development over the past three decades has largely been driven by its success in selling its products to the rest of the world, in particular to the US.",
      "Exports to the US contribute around 30% of Vietnam's GDP, and 25% of Cambodia's.",
      "That growth story is now imperilled by the punitive measures being imposed in Washington.",
      "The longer-term impact of these tariffs, assuming they stay in place, will vary, but will certainly pose big challenges to the governments of Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia in particular.",
      "As Trump hikes tariffs again, nervous businesses weigh what comes next",
      "China is not backing down from Trump's tariff war. What next?",
      "Vietnam's \"bamboo diplomacy\", where it attempts to be friends with everyone and balance ties with both China and the US, will now be tested.",
      "Under the leadership of the new Communist Party Secretary-General To Lam, Vietnam has embarked on an ambitious plan to build an upper-income, knowledge-and-tech-based economy by the year 2045. It has been aiming for annual growth rates in excess of 8%.",
      "Exporting more to the US, already its biggest market, was central to that plan.",
      "It was also the main reason why Vietnam agreed to elevate their relationship to that of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2023.",
      "The Communist Party, which tolerates little dissent and has no formal political opposition, depends on its economic pledges for its legitimacy. Already viewed by many economists as too ambitious, these will now be even harder to meet.",
      "Thailand depends on US exports less than Vietnam \u2013 under 10% of GDP \u2013 but the Thai economy is in much worse shape, having underperformed for the past decade. The Thai government is trying to find ways to lift economic growth, most recently attempting but failing to legalise gambling, and these tariffs are another economic blow it cannot afford.",
      "For Cambodia, the tariffs pose perhaps the greatest political threat in the region.",
      "The government of Hun Manet has proved just as authoritarian as that of his father Hun Sen, whom he succeeded two years ago, but it is vulnerable.",
      "Keeping the Hun family's hold on power has required offering rival clans in Cambodia economic privileges like monopolies or land concessions, but this has helped create a glut of property developments, which are no longer selling, and a mass of grievances over land expropriations.",
      "The garment sector, which employs 750,000 people, has been a crucial social safety valve, giving steady incomes to Cambodia's poorest. Thousands of those jobs are now likely to be lost as a result of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "Unlike China, which has hit back with its own levies, the official message from governments in South East Asia is don't panic, don't retaliate, but negotiate.",
      "Vietnam has dispatched deputy prime minister Ho Duc Phoc to Washington to plead his country's case, and has offered to eliminate all tariffs on US imports. Thailand plans to send its finance minister to make a similar appeal, and has offered to reduce its tariffs and buy more American products, like food and aircraft.",
      "Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is also heading to Washington, though with  exports to the US making up only 11% of Malaysia's total, his country is less affected than some of its neighbours.",
      "However, the Trump administration appears to be in no mood to compromise.",
      "Peter Navarro, President Trump's senior counsellor on trade and manufacturing and one of the main thinkers behind the new policy, said in interviews on Monday that Vietnam's offer of zero tariffs was meaningless, because it would not address the deficit in trade where Vietnam sells $15 worth of goods to the US for every $1 it buys.",
      "He accused Vietnam of keeping multiple non-tariff barriers to US imports, and said that one-third of all Vietnamese exports to the US were actually Chinese products, trans-shipped through Vietnam.",
      "The proportion of Vietnamese exports which are being made or trans-shipped there to avoid US tariffs on China is difficult to assess, but detailed trade studies put it at between 7% and 16%, not one-third.",
      "Like Vietnam, the government of Cambodia has appealed to the US to postpone the tariffs while it attempts to negotiate.",
      "The local American Chamber of Commerce has called for the 49% tariffs to be dropped, making the point that the Cambodian garment industry, the country's biggest employer, will be badly affected, but that no tariff level, however high, will see clothing and footwear manufacturing return to the US.",
      "Perhaps the most perverse tariff rate is the 44% applied to Myanmar, a country mired in a civil war, which has no capacity to buy more US goods.",
      "US exports make up only a small proportion of Myanmar's GDP, less than 1%.",
      "But as in Cambodia, that sector, mainly garments, is one of the few that provides a steady income to poor families in Myanmar's cities.",
      "In a supreme irony,  Trump has until now been a popular figure in this region.",
      "He has been widely admired in Vietnam for his tough, transactional approach to foreign policy, and Cambodia's former strongman Hun Sen, still the main power behind the scenes, has long sought a close personal relationship with the US president, proudly posting selfies with him at their first meeting in 2017.",
      "Only last month Cambodia was praising  Trump for shutting down the US media networks Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, which often carried the views of Cambodian dissidents.",

    "story": [
      "It sounds like something from a science fiction movie, but Stephen Eisele is confident that one day his company will open a data centre on the Moon.",
      "\"The way we see it is that by putting the data centre in space, you're really offering unparalleled security,\" says the president of Lonestar Data Holdings.",
      "Last month, the Florida-based firm claimed to have successfully tested a tiny data centre the size of a hardback book that hitched a ride to the Moon on the Athena Lunar Lander from US space exploration firm Intuitive Machines. This, in turn, had been launched by a rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX.",
      "Data centres are the vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Lonestar says that putting them on the Moon will offer customers secure, reliable data processing, while taking advantage of unlimited solar energy to power them.",
      "The environmental campaigners fighting against data centres",
      "Data centre power use 'to surge six-fold in 10 years'",
      "Concern UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages",
      "And while space-based data centres may sound far-fetched, it's an idea that's really starting to take off.",
      "Part of the reason is rocketing demand and the difficulty of finding suitable sites on Earth.",
      "The ever-expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) computing has seen a massive increase in the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed around the world.",
      "As a result, the need for data centres has shot up too, with annual demand set to rise between 19% and 22% by 2030, according to global management consultants McKinsey.",
      "New facilities are springing up all the time - but it's getting hard to find places to put them. Data centres are large and sprawling, and use enormous amounts of power and water for cooling.",
      "And increasingly local people don't want them built nearby.",
      "Putting data centres in space \u2013 either in orbit around Earth, or on the Moon - the theory goes, means they can't do quite so much harm. There's more-or-less unlimited energy available from the sun, for example, and no neighbours to complain about the environmental impacts.",
      "Not only that, space-based data centres could specialise in services for spacecraft and other space facilities, with space-to-space data transfers quicker than from the ground.",
      "Last summer, a European Commission-funded feasibility study into orbiting data centres published its results.",
      "The Ascend report by carried out by Thales Alenia Space - a joint venture between French and Italian aerospace groups Thales and Leonardo - published its results.",
      "It determined that deploying data centres in space \"could transform the European digital landscape\", and be \"more eco-friendly\".",
      "Thales Alenia Space envisages building a constellation of 13 satellites measuring  a combined 200m-by-80m, and with a total data processing power of around 10 megawatts (MW). That's equivalent to a current medium-sized, ground-based data centre, with some 5,000 servers.",
      "Based on technologies that already exist or are under development, the satellites would be assembled in orbit.",
      "Damien Dumestier, Ascend project architect at Thales Alenia Space, says that for space-based data centres to be more environmentally friendly than existing ground-based ones it will be necessary to make the rocket launchers 10 times less emissive over their lifecycles. He says this looks possible.",
      "\"But in order to cover the new technology's developments and the production capacity ramp-up to benefit from scale, we have to consider larger system capacity, around 200MW, meaning 200 of our envisaged large space infrastructures and 200 launches,\" he says.",
      "\"The main question is when an adapted launcher will be ready. Depending on the investment and decisions to be taken, this could be done for 2030 or 2035, meaning commercial viability before 2037.\"",
      "However, despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology, Dr Domenico Vicinanza, associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, says there are numerous big hurdles before space-based data centres can be a viable proposition.",
      "\"Even with the contribution and advancements of companies like SpaceX, launching hardware into orbit remains extremely expensive,\" he says. \"Each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars.",
      "\"Space-based data centres would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect, power, and cool them. All of which add up in weight and complexity.\"",
      "Cooling the equipment will be a particular problem,  because even though space is cold, conventional cooling systems don't work well without gravity.",
      "Meanwhile, space weather can damage electronics, while the ever-increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.",
      "Dr Vicinanza adds: \"And fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward. Even with robotics and automation, there are limits to what can be repaired remotely.",
      "\"A big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission, potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months.\"",
      "Yet firms like Lonestar are supremely confident, and say that they are responding to demand. \"We wouldn't be doing this if the customers weren't asking us to,\" says Mr Scott.",
      "Its next target is to put a small data centre in orbit around the moon in 2027. Meanwhile, other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster, such as Washington state-based Starcloud, which is due to launch a satellite-based data centre next month, and start commercial operations in mid-2026.",
      "Lonestar's Mr Eidele says that space-based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks. Instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station.",
      "\"It's like having the vaults at the back of the bank,\" he says. \"You don't have to open it every day, but it's there to provide an extra measure of security, and the distance from the Earth to the moon offers that - it's that much harder to hack, that much harder to access.\"",

      "Hong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year.",
      "So when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note.",
      "Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.",
      "The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: \"The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,\" he explains.",
      "\"There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,\" Mr Panaruna added.",
      "The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.",
      "To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India.",
      "Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.",
      "\"These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,\" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.",

      "\"It's complicated,\" says Mr Sharma.",
      "\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.",
      "\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"",

      "Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. \"The shift to high value is now happening.\"",
      "\"Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,\" he adds.",
      "Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.",
      "\"The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.\"",
      "But Mr Sharma says change is inevitable.",

      "Responding, a Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) spokesperson said the social security system would always be there for those with severe health conditions and a new premium was being introduced for those who would never be able to work.",

      "Ms Read said while people needed to try and live healthier lives, that was a \"big problem\" because many \"simply can't afford healthy food or warm homes\".",
      "\"The benefits changes are going to be crippling,\" the GP said.",
      "\"I understand people need to be helped back into work, but for people who have been out of work with chronic pain or multiple conditions there has to be some kind of provision.",
      "\"Anxiety levels are huge and that affects people's ability to go to work. It's anxiety that is not caused by medical issues and if we just focus on medication, we are only papering over the cracks.\"",
      "'Dignity and independence'",
      "Ms Read said she worked in an area where people were affected by long-term conditions \"much earlier\" than in more affluent areas.",
      "\"They are getting more than one long-term condition in their late 30s and early 40s, compared to their 70s in more affluent areas.\"",

      "What are interest rates and why do they change?",
      "An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it.",
      "The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money.",
      "This influences what lenders then charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts.",

      "It has a target to keep inflation at 2%.",
      "When inflation is high, it may decide to raise rates to bring inflation back down.",
      "The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand.",
      "Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them.",
      "What has happened to UK interest rates and will they go down further?",
      "It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates. The Bank has to consider whether inflation remains at or below its target, and how the UK economy is doing more generally.",
      "It also pays close attention to the performance of the global economy, which has been thrown into chaos by US tariffs.",
      "The main inflation measure, CPI, was 2.8% in the 12 months to February 2025, down slightly from the previous month.",
      "Although that is far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022, it remains above the 2% target.",
      "After many months of keeping interest rates at a 16-year high of 5.25%, the Bank of England cut them to 5% in August 2024, and again to 4.75% in November. Rates fell again to 4.5% in February, where they stayed in March.",
      "When the Bank cut rates in February, it also cut its growth forecast for the UK economy in 2025.",
      "It said it expected the UK to only narrowly avoid falling into recession - where the economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row - and predicted that inflation would rise towards 4% later in 2025.",
      "Announcing the decision to hold rates in March, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned about global economic uncertainty but said that he still believed interest rates were on a \"gradually declining path\".",
      "The Bank was concerned about the possible impacts of increases to the amount of National Insurance paid by employers and the minimum wage, both of which took effect at the start of April.",
      "There are growing fears that the US tariffs could spark a full-blown international trade war, push up prices and fuel inflation around the world - including in the UK.",
      "If that happens and the economy suffers, the Bank may may feel it has to cut rates further than it had planned to do at the start of the year.",

      "About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages with an interest rate of 3% or below are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027.",

    "story": [
      "CCTV of an autistic pupil being restrained by staff in a seclusion room at a special school is \"brutal\" and \"unlawful\", a restraint expert has told the BBC.",
      "The footage shows the 12-year-old being held face-down on the floor in a prone restraint involving five members of staff.",
      "His mother, who gave it to the BBC, said she was \"horrified\" when she watched it.",
      "The management of the school, in Leeds, said multiple investigations found staff had no case to answer and the expert views were a \"difference of opinion\".",
      "The BBC has also spoken to an autistic pupil who was aged five when he was detained for prolonged periods at a different school.",
      "The BBC's investigation into seclusion - facilities known variously as calming, quiet or safe rooms - began last year when we uncovered CCTV of non-verbal pupils being abused and neglected at Whitefield School in north London.",
      "A spokesperson for the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described those failings as \"horrendous\" and said they \"must never happen again\".",
      "Now, we have separately learned of concerns about the use of such rooms elsewhere, including footage recorded in October 2023 at Springwell Leeds Academy North site - a school for pupils with social, emotional and mental health special needs.",
      "The CCTV includes one 50-minute video in which an 12-year-old autistic pupil is repeatedly restrained by staff and shown trying to kick them.",
      "Near the end of the footage, the child swings his arm at staff and is then manoeuvred to the floor. He is then held in a prone restraint for three minutes.",
      "Eric Baskind, an expert on the use of force in institutional settings who has reviewed the footage, said the restraint is \"too brutal, unnecessary and, in my view, unlawful\" - an opinion endorsed by a second expert asked to review the footage by the BBC.",
      "Mr Baskind said the force was unreasonable as staff members already had control of the boy and could have moved him into a sitting position on the bench instead.",
      "\"They just dragged him [into the prone position],\" he said. \"That would have been really traumatic, and it would have escalated the hostility in the situation, which is the exact opposite of what they ought to have been trying to do.\"",
      "A third expert, education consultant Elizabeth Swan, said the use of force was \"unreasonable, excessive and unnecessarily prolonged\".",
      "She also said the room resembled a \"holding cell\" and many autistic children find being deprived of sensory stimulation traumatising.",
      "The boy's mother, Zoe, requested the footage from the school through an application for his personal information known as a subject access request, and later shared it with the BBC.",
      "\"This is a child and these are five grown adults in a school where he's supposed to be safe,\" she said.",
      "\"A calming room should be a room for children to calm down with blankets, teddies and soft lighting. Not a padded cell. You wouldn't put an animal in there.\"",
      "In response, Wellspring Academy Trust's chief executive, Mark Wilson, told the BBC that it had conducted three investigations into the footage and found no case to answer against staff.",
      "He also said that an investigation by Leeds City Council's local authority designated officer - responsible for managing allegations against adults who work with children - had found that malpractice was unsubstantiated.",
      "In a further statement, Mr Wilson said the incident was typical of those that happen in schools \"from time to time\" and this \"difference of opinion\" concerned footage which was \"selective\", lacking context and sound, and misrepresentative of staff care. He also said the school was rated \"good\" by Ofsted.\u00ad",
      "Although the door to the room at the Leeds school was open, the BBC's investigation into seclusion has revealed that pupils are also sometimes locked in rooms elsewhere. Zip up tents have also been used - and even, in one instance, a cage.",
      "We have spoken to an eight-year-old autistic pupil who was repeatedly locked inside seclusion rooms at a different school while aged five.",
      "The boy - whose identity we have protected - told the BBC that being sent there was \"horrible\" and left him feeling angry and worried.",
      "\"It was just very scary because they can put me in there for as long as they want,\" he said.",
      "Our initial investigation into Whitefield School in London showed pupils being pushed into rooms with Rhino pads - that are often used in rugby training - and also being thrown to the floor and left sitting in vomit, before its calming rooms were shut in 2017.",
      "However, no rules have been changed and schools in the UK are not legally required to tell parents when they place their child in seclusion.",
      "In 2021, 550 hours of CCTV were handed to the Metropolitan Police after it had been discovered by new leadership at Whitefield School - but the force's investigation into staff concluded last year without anyone being charged.",
      "Now the BBC has learned that the local authority where the school is based, Waltham Forest, was warned that calming rooms were being over-used at Whitefield the year before they were shut down following an Ofsted inspection - but it failed to act.",
      "A charity, the British Institute of Learning Disabilities, visited the school and warned of the harms of seclusion. Waltham Forest did not comment when approached by the BBC.",
      "The Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has repeatedly declined to be interviewed about the lack of regulation of calming rooms.",
      "In response to our latest findings, the government said a consultation is under way about use of force and restrictive interventions - and it is awaiting the findings of a Waltham Forest investigation.",
      "Draft guidance asks schools to have a policy on seclusion but this will not be a legal requirement.",
      "Meanwhile, the families of Whitefield pupils have now formed a campaign group that is calling on the government to act.",
      "Maria - the parent of one of the 39 affected Whitefield pupils - said ministers \"have seen the footage and said 'this can't happen again' - and yet there's no change.\"",
      "\"Anything that happens to any other child or young person since they said that is on them - as their inaction makes them culpable.\"",

      "\"These children are not spending these hours on their phones while sat in school,\" Dame Rachel said in a new report.",
      "She said schools should educate young people about online risks - but parents and carers needed more help to manage their children's online habits and technology companies must \"take responsibility for making the online world safe\".",
      "She added that she would back any head teacher's decision to ban phones, but added: \"It should always be their choice, based on their knowledge of what's best for the children in their own classrooms, not a direction imposed nationally by the government.\"",

      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",

      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment.

      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",

      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",

This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",

      "The parents of a baby who was killed at a nursery have told the BBC they want stronger safeguarding measures to be introduced.",
      "Nine-month-old Genevieve died from asphyxiation when she was tightly swaddled, strapped to a beanbag, and left unattended by a nursery worker for 90 minutes.",
      "In an exclusive interview, Katie Wheeler and John Meehan told the BBC that life without Genevieve was \"unbearable\".",
      "When she sent her daughter to nursery, she \"never in a million years thought that anything like this would happen\", says Ms Wheeler.",
      "The couple have described as \"horrifying\", figures obtained by the BBC that show there were almost 20,000 reports of serious childcare incidents in England's nurseries in the past five years.",
      "That is an average of about 75 \"significant events\" reported to Ofsted each week - including incidents of serious injury or significant harm. There have even been rare cases involving deaths.",
      "The latest figures for serious incidents in the year 2023-24 are 40% higher than five years previously.",
      "Ofsted - which inspects England's education providers - says the rise may, in part, be due to its increased efforts to ensure nurseries report such events.",
      "Industry body, the Early Years Alliance, says most providers prioritise safety and that safeguarding breaches are extremely rare.",
      "Ms Wheeler and Mr Meehan are now calling for more frequent Ofsted inspections and for CCTV footage to be checked by inspectors.",
      "Genevieve had been at the now-closed Tiny Toes nursery in Stockport, Greater Manchester, for a week when she died.",
      "CCTV footage showed her struggling and coughing, but nursery worker Kate Roughley did not check on her properly until she was \"unresponsive and blue\", her trial heard. Roughley received a 14-year prison sentence for manslaughter in May last year.",
      "\"I couldn't understand how a baby of this age could go to sleep for a nap in the afternoon and then not wake up,\" Ms Wheeler told us.",
      "\"I completely lost who I was, that night in hospital, holding her.\"",
      "Nurseries made more than 4,200 reports of serious childcare incidents in 2023-24, the BBC has found, compared with 3,021 in 2019-20 - according to Ofsted figures, obtained through a Freedom of Information request.",
      "Ofsted - which regulates more than 27,000 non-domestic childcare settings in England - says these were reports it had assessed as urgent.",
      "Incidents could range from injuries or illnesses, to serious accidents and deaths. They also include events affecting nursery premises, such as fires or floods.",
      "Ofsted's broad criteria for reporting can mean nursery workers \"err on the side of caution\", the Early Years Alliance says - meaning investigations often find no safeguarding breach has, in fact, occurred.",
      "But a childcare expert says the rise in the number of reports highlights a \"dire situation\".",
      "\"Standards [of care] are so low that the government surely has an obligation to improve them,\" says Helen Penn, professor of early childhood from the University of East London.",
      "Parents often rely on Ofsted's inspections and subsequent ratings to help them choose the best childcare setting.",
      "Full inspections usually happen every six years, but the regulator can inspect more often if a nursery is graded as inadequate or requiring improvement - or if concerns are raised.",
      "Schools rated good or outstanding are usually inspected every four years - and more frequently if graded lower.",
      "More than 1,500 nursery inspections had been brought forward after receiving reports of serious childcare incidents - Ofsted told us.",
      "But a former Ofsted inspector told us the regulator is not conducting enough inspections to identify poor practice and protect children.",
      "The ex-inspector, who did not want to be named, says inspections are a \"tick box exercise\" which are \"very easy to manipulate\".",
      "\"As long as they can say: 'We've asked all these questions, what more can we do?' But you do that once every so many years - how is that safeguarding the children?\" she says.",
      "Details of organisations offering support with child bereavement are available at BBC Action Line",
      "Details of organisations offering support with child bereavement are available at BBC Action Line",
      "The BBC has spoken to more than 20 former and current nursery workers, all from different premises across England, who said they had witnessed poor care.",
      "Many said frequent short-staffing was a factor in children being put at risk - and that Ofsted inspectors were not always able to spot this.",
      "Until 2015, inspectors would arrive at nurseries unannounced - but only a third of inspections are now carried out this way. Most nurseries are informed the day before.",
      "The notice period is used by some nurseries to deliberately mislead inspectors, some nursery workers told us. Managers ask friends or family to attend, they say, to make a nursery appear fully staffed.",
      "One former worker said 15 babies had been left sleeping in a room with only a baby monitor and no staff members to look after them. But when Ofsted announced an inspection, managers called in staff from other locations.",
      "The ex-Ofsted inspector says she witnessed workers man-handling children during inspections. \"If you can do that in front of someone, what are you planning on doing if nobody is watching?\" she adds.",
      "Misleading inspections is an \"appalling practice\", says Yvette Stanley, Ofsted's Head of Early Years and Social Care - adding that inspectors have to rely on the \"integrity of providers\".",
      "As police reviewed nursery CCTV as part of their investigation into Genevieve's death, it revealed a second staff member had also been causing harm to children.",
      "Rebecca Gregory was jailed for three years last September after being convicted of the wilful neglect and ill-treatment of children, including threatening and pushing babies younger than one.",
      "Ofsted inspectors do not routinely check CCTV footage - and the regulator says it cannot mandate CCTV use in nurseries.",
      "There is no government guidance on checking footage during inspections and it does not have the resources to do this, it adds.",
      "The former owners of Tiny Toes in Stockport say they cannot comment because of an ongoing investigation by Stockport Council.",
      "Local authorities are responsible for investigating any safeguarding concerns at nurseries.",
      "In light of our findings from Ofsted about a broad range of incidents, we asked councils across England about the specific number of times harm had been caused to children by nursery workers.",
      "Seventy-two out of more than 150 councils responded to Freedom of Information requests with figures indicating there had been 5,795 reports or allegations of children being harmed by nursery workers, over a five-year period between 2019 and 2024.",
      "There were like-for-like figures from 36 councils for both that period and the five years up to 2015, when Ofsted stopped routine no-notice inspections.",
      "Reports of harm to young children almost tripled over that time - from 1,303 between 2010-15, to 3,342 between 2019-24. These figures may include cases where the incident was either accidental or unproven.",
      "Standards of care are low and if something does not change there will be \"more accidents, more harm to babies, more unhappy parents and children,\" says early childhood professor Helen Penn.",
      "Ofsted says it is giving \"conspicuous care and monitoring\" to reports of harm to children.",
      "More frequent inspections may be a solution, says Ofsted's Yvette Stanley, but she says the regulator does not currently have the resources available to do this.",
      "\"We think we do enough no-notice inspections to reassure ourselves in the cases where the data is worrying,\" she adds.",
      "The Early Years Alliance added that children's safety should \"never be compromised\" and it welcomed any action which strengthens this.",
      "The Department for Education (DfE) has said it will introduce stronger safeguarding measures in early years settings in September, including \"enhanced recruitment practices\" intended to prevent unsuitable people from working with children.",
      "A spokesperson said the department will \"continue to closely monitor whether any further changes to safeguarding requirements are needed in early years to keep children as safe as possible\"."

      "The star was \"nervous\" and \"irritable\", partly because he was recovering from a hip replacement, he said, but also because he was working in a new way - writing live in the studio with Carlile, producer Andrew Watt and long-term lyricist Bernie Taupin.",
      "\"It was an enormous challenge, getting those four people together,\" he told the BBC. \"And the challenge really was at my feet.",
      "\"I was very nervous [because] I wanted the album to stand a certain way, but you can't always guarantee it will.",

      "\"I'm a gay woman, Elton's a gay man and we both have families, and our dreams have come true,\" she told the NME.",
      "\"I was thinking, wouldn't it be cool to write an anthem for young gay kids out there that calls them into a bigger, more elegant, more fabulous life? Just like, 'Go, go! Don't let anything hold you back!'\"",

    "story": [
      "\"Every day, as a deaf person, you're reminded of your deafness,\" says William Mager, writer of new BBC thriller Reunion.",
      "These reminders can range from having to face medical appointments with no available interpreter to being excluded from important decisions about your own life, he says.",
      "\"All those things add up over time and generate a sense of injustice,\" Mager says, adding that artist Christine Sun Kim describes this feeling as \"deaf rage\".",
      "It is a feeling partly borne out of the frustration and isolation of living in a hearing-centred world.",
      "This rage, alongside a love of 70s thrillers, is what inspired Mager's new drama.",
      "The bilingual thriller features both British Sign Language (BSL), with subtitles, and spoken English. The majority of the cast in Reunion are deaf or use BSL in their roles.",
      "The four-part series, from the producers of Adolescence, tells the story of Daniel Brennan (Matthew Gurney), a deaf man on a journey of revenge after spending a decade in prison.",
      "Mager, a lifelong fan of 70s thrillers, says he wanted to put his own \"twist\" on films like Get Carter and The Outfit (which feature \"intimidating men in cool clothes\" on a mission of vengeance) by drawing on the deaf experience as well.",
      "\"Reunion starts out like those classic thrillers, but ends up in a very different place,\" the writer says.",
      "As main character Brennan hunts down a man known only as Monroe, viewers become aware of a painful secret he's been hiding and the struggles he is facing to find justice in a hearing-centred world.",
      "The Guardian called the performances in the show \"outstanding\" and the switch between signed and spoken language \"utterly seamless\", while the Independent says Reunion is \"in many ways, a groundbreaking show\".",
      "Ultimately, Mager says he wanted to touch on issues unique to the deaf community in the programme, as well as providing opportunities for deaf creatives.",
      "'Unfortunately, that's still the reality'",
      "Mager says communication is a central theme of Reunion and the drama shows how each character struggles with it.",
      "One key example is a scene where Brennan's daughter Carly has to pass on painful information to her mother and father that would usually be relayed by professionals, due to a lack of interpreters.",
      "\"Unfortunately, that's still the reality today,\" Mager says, explaining his wife recently experienced this, having to interpret for her mother at a hospital appointment, because an interpreter had not been booked.",
      "Mager says this shows how deaf people often have to rely on someone else voicing them in order to be understood.",
      "\"That can be hard for a deaf person to relinquish that control over what they're saying to someone else,\" he says.",
      "Another thing Mager wanted to draw attention to was literacy rates in deaf children.",
      "A key plot point in Reunion is that Brennan is unable to read or write in English which, coupled with the prison's failure to book interpreters, means he misses important letters from his daughter and does not have his case details fully explained.",
      "\"Deaf children often lag behind their hearing counterparts in education, particularly [in] reading and writing,\" Mager says.",
      "The writer adds that, in his opinion, this is partly due to language deprivation, resulting from deaf children not being given access to the language they're most comfortable with from a young age.",
      "According to Simon Want, from the National Deaf Children's Society, many deaf children face barriers to accessing a good education.",
      "'I hope that door stays open'",
      "Mager says it was a \"joy\" to see the actors both deaf and hearing bringing his script to life.",
      "On set, deaf first assistant director Sam Arnold worked with hearing first assistant director Alex Szygowski to relay directions to the cast and crew.",
      "And hearing actors Anne-Marie Duff and Lara Peake learned to sign for their roles.",
      "\"They're all fantastic. My favourite thing about making Reunion has been to see the genuine enthusiasm and excitement [of] the cast and crew,\" Mager says.",
      "The writer adds that he hopes the series will \"open a door\" for deaf creatives both in front of and behind the camera.",

      "The veteran had a very big reason for wanting to recreate what happened that day - to help replace the lost memories of his colleague Elliott Miller.",
      "Miller, a former Navy Seal, was so badly injured in Ramadi that he suffered traumatic brain injury and memory loss, and had to have a leg amputated.",
      "During the mission, Mendoza carried the unconscious soldier to the rescue tank that ultimately saved his life.",
      "\"Elliott doesn't remember it, and when he woke up, he had a lot of questions,\" Mendoza says.",
      "\"No matter how many maps we drew, or how many times we wrote it out - without that core memory, I think he's had a hard time.",
      "\"It just raised more questions than answers. So I wanted to recreate this one.\"",
      "So Garland and Mendoza decided to make Warfare together, sharing writing and directing credits, and dedicating the film to Miller.",
      "The crucial question is whether seeing the film helped Miller piece things together.",
      "\"It did, yeah - he was a sponge,\" Mendoza says.",
      "\"We walked him through it - he had a lot of questions, he's got kids that have questions.",
      "\"It's now a film memory, but it's as close as he's gonna have \u2013 he's super grateful.\"",
      "Miller was played by Jarvis, who calls him \"a funny guy... he's great - a living embodiment of perseverance\".",
      "It was a \"unique situation to be in when you're entrusted with portraying somebody that's sitting right across from you\", Jarvis said, about having the person he was playing actually on set.",
      "\"But because he didn't remember [what happened], a lot of my references had to come from his colleagues.\"",
      "The soldiers' casting has caused some excitement online, with some publications breathily calling the actors \"all of the internet's boyfriends\" and \"red hot rising stars\".",
      "Garland arches an eyebrow at this, and Mendoza jumps in to talk about why those actors were chosen.",
      "\"I've said this to them, so I'm not trying to offend them, but we weren't looking for the best actors. They're all great actors. We were looking for the right actors,\" he says.",
      "\"So what that means is their willingness to push their bodies past a comfort level that they're maybe not used to. 'You're gonna be exhausted. You're gonna be required to rely on other people. It's not about you, it's about the team'.",
      "\"And the ones that jump at that opportunity, you're like, 'Yep, that's the attitude that we need'.\"",
      "Collating and cross-checking the soldiers' memories was a big job, largely undertaken by Garland.",
      "\"I think there's an inherent value in attempting to be honest and truthful about something as serious and significant as war,\" he says.",
      "He shot the film in a studio in a suburb north of London, on a former World War Two airfield, making it in real-time to recreate \"a real incident of combat... as honestly, forensically and accurately as possible\".",
      "Not surprisingly, while sharing credits with Garland, former US Navy Seal Mendoza ran the actors' bootcamp.",
      "He was played by Woon-A-Tai, who calls him \"a brilliant instructor who instilled a lot of confidence in us\", while also making gun safety a top priority.",
      "The actor was also fascinated by the narrative not being \"dramatised or Hollywoodised\".",
      "\"To see these guys not obey orders - and do what they needed to save their platoon was interesting to me,\" he says, talking about the soldiers' evacuation process.",
      "Mendoza thinks the film may also help veterans who are struggling to express what warfare can be like.",
      "\"Some of these things are harder to explain in words,\" he says. \"So art imagery is how I'm able to communicate that.\"",
      "Connor echoes this, saying: \"A lot of these men are very much less inclined to talk about themselves in these situations, whether it be to be due to humility, or a difficulty in really articulating it.",
      "\"A lot of them just don't really enjoy talking about their involvement.\"",
      "The film has been called \"the most harrowing \u2013 and honest \u2013 depiction of modern combat ever made\" by the Telegraph, while the New Yorker said it offers a \"hyperrealist rebuke of the American war movie\".",
      "The Guardian said the \"film-makers' message gets lost in the deafening blizzard of battle\", while Empire added: \"It may well be cinema's most effective, purest anti-war film: there is no sentimentality, no hand-wringing, but most significantly not a second of it makes war look cool, or attractive.\"",
      "Poulter says he admires the film-makers' determination to make Warfare purely factual.",
      "\"Hopefully this film contributes to a better understanding of just how negative, and how the consequences of war are characterised by a lot of loss...",
      "\"I think this is as much an anti-war film as you can possibly hope to see.\"",

      "\"We did play one new song towards the end of the tour, and nobody threw things at us, or left to go to the bar,\" he said. \"So we just thought we'd carry on and see what we could conjure up.\"",

      "\"This time, they were all written before we went into the studio, and I realised it was a lot less stressful.",

    "summary": "A CMS committee report warns of the need to safeguard \"culturally distinct British productions\".",
    "story": [
      "A share of the revenue streaming services make from subscription fees should be paid into a fund to support British high-end TV production, an influential group of MPs has said.",
      "In a new report, the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee urged the government to improve support measures for producers while safeguarding the creation of distinctly British content.",
      "It follows an inquiry into the UK TV and film industry which examined the effects of the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon and Apple TV.",
      "The report noted how \"vital\" dramas such as Adolescence are to the country's \"identity, national conversations and talent pipeline\", which they say is now \"under threat\".",
      "It is \"time for streamers to put their money where their mouth is\", the report read, suggesting that streaming companies should pay \"5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance drama with a specific interest to British audiences\".",
      "Chair of the CMS committee, MP Dame Caroline Dinenage, noted how recent \"big box-office blockbusters made in Britain have showcased the UK's world-class film and high-end television industry like never before\".",
      "\"But the boom in inward investment of recent years now risks crowding out our many talented independent British producers,\" she said.",
      "She added: \"While streamers like Netflix and Amazon have proved a valuable addition for the industry and economy, unless the government urgently intervenes to rebalance the playing field, for every Adolescence adding to the national conversation, there will be countless distinctly British stories that never make it to our screens.\"",
      "Adolescence, created by Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham, tells the story of a 13-year-old boy who is charged with killing a female classmate.",
      "This week, it became fourth most popular English-language series in Netflix's history with 114 million views.",
      "A Netflix spokeswoman said: \"The UK is Netflix's biggest production hub outside of North America - and we want it to stay that way.",
      "\"But in an increasingly competitive global market, it's key to create a business environment that incentivises rather than penalises investment, risk taking and success. Levies diminish competitiveness and penalise audiences who ultimately bear the increased costs.\"",
      "The Association for Commercial Broadcasters and On-Demand Services (COBA) said a levy risks damaging streamers' investment in the UK.",
      "Coba executive director Adam Minns said: \"Especially in this economic climate, a levy risks impacting existing content budgets for UK shows, jobs, and growth, along with raising costs for businesses.",
      "\"Ironically, it could actually damage public service broadcaster dramas by reducing co-production budgets at streamers.\"",
      "He added pressure on domestic production stemmed from the real terms decline in the TV licence fee.",
      "A BBC spokesman said the corporation \"continues to invest\" in British content but faced \"significant financial challenges due to pressure on the licence fee and rising industry costs\".",
      "\"It is therefore integral that the BBC and the wider UK creative industries have the support in place to drive growth in the creative economy and support homegrown content and storytelling.\"",
      "The report released on Thursday noted how last year there was a 27% decrease in the number of domestic high-end TV productions made in the UK and a 25% fall in spend.",
      "The calls for greater help come after Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky told BBC News last month that the industry was in crisis, and that public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV could no longer afford to make high-end British drama.",
      "Fair levy or unfair tariff?",
      "The arrival of the streamers into the UK market \"drove up the price of everything\", Kosminsky told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, to the point where the public service broadcasters \"couldn't afford to make their programs anymore, so we need a new pot of money.\"",
      "He underlined how 17 other countries in Europe have imposed a similar levy \"so that public service broadcasters can stay in the game.\"",
      "Speaking on the same programme, former BBC One controller Peter Fincham replied saying he did not agree.",
      "\"I think this sounds to me a little bit like a tariff - to use a more fashionable word - and indeed a form of protectionism.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for the Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) said: \"We acknowledge the challenges facing our brilliant film and TV industry and are working with it through our industrial strategy to consider what more needs to be done to unlock growth and develop the skills pipeline.",
      "\"We thank the committee for its report which we will respond to in due course.\"",
      "'Support freelancers'",
      "The report also noted while the introduction of tax breaks for independent British films, and for film and TV studios in England may have helped, it was not a \"silver bullet\" for solving many of the issues facing British producers.",
      "As well as providing greater support and resources for UK TV production workforces, it also suggested that lawmakers should consider cutting VAT on cinema tickets as well as doing more to meet the challenges posed by AI.",
      "Commenting on the report, Paul W Fleming, general secretary of Equity, which represents British performers, said the government should \"heed the call\" for the licensing of creative works in all cases where they are used to train artificial intelligence models.",
      "\"AI is being built illegally by stealing Equity members' life's works,\" he said.",
      "Big tech firms \"must be held to account\", he added, \"brought to the table and made to pay creators what they owe.\"",
      "The cross-party committee recommended the government and British Film Institute (BFI) should launch a national awareness campaign, highlighting the employment opportunities offered by film and high-end TV, and \"the range of skills the industry requires\".",
      "It stressed how the industry \"benefits hugely from the flexibility afforded by a predominantly freelance workforce\" and therefore more should be done to \"support freelancers when they are out of work\"; such as the introduction of a minimum hourly wage or guaranteed basic income.",
      "Head of industry union Bectu, Philippa Childs, said: \"We welcome this timely and incisive report from the committee which identifies many of the urgent challenges currently facing the industry and its workforce.\"",
      "She added: \"It's essential that the industry does not become too skewed towards large streamers, which risks the homogenisation of content and the loss of much of the UK's unique and distinctive output.\"",

      "It costs around \u00a315 per bar and can only be bought during specific hours of the day to ensure the company can fulfil all their orders.",
      "I also saw similar bars sold in many shops in the region, dubbed \"Dubai chocolate\" and adorned with pictures of pistachios and filo pastry.",
      "Alani says the \"copycat\" bars are \"very frustrating because people are trying knockoffs, which damages our brand\".",
      "One of the reasons for the bar's surge in popularity has been social media - with a viral video by TikTok user Maria Vehera  from 2023 being cited as one of the main reasons for its rise to prominence.",
      "It shows Vehera trying the Knafeh bar for the first time - along with several others made by the same chocolatier - and has been liked nearly seven million times.",
      "The way the bar looks is made for social media -  from the attractive orange and green spots on top of the smooth milk chocolate to the crunch sound it makes when you break off a piece.",
      "Chocolate combined with pistachio isn't new but the real standout element is the crunchy nature of the filling, with the filo pastry adding a texture and thickness to the bar.",
      "Since the Can't Get Knafeh of It bar is only available in one country, other brands have started to sell their versions in the UK, including Swiss chocolate manufacturer Lindt whose Dubai chocolate is being sold for \u00a310 in supermarkets.",
      "Since stocking the bar, Waitrose says they've had to introduce a two-bar limit for customers in order to regulate stock levels.",
      "Another version has also been sold by Home Bargains, while supermarket Lidl has its own version for \u00a34.99 and is also limiting purchase numbers.",
      "One influencer documented how the bar been kept behind tills for this reason.",
      "Having tried the Lindt bar and a couple of other versions being sold in corner shops, there is quite a contrast.",
      "The FIX chocolate is billed as a \"dessert bar\" and needs to be kept in the fridge, with a short expiry date like many dairy items.",
      "This isn't the case for the others, which have been designed to have a longer shelf life.",
      "You can also see the difference in taste and texture - the original bar is almost double the width of the Lindt bar, which is more aligned to the size and shape of a standard chocolate bar.",
      "When Alani and Hamouda first started out, they employed one person to fulfil around six to seven orders a day.",
      "But since growing in popularity, primarily thanks to TikTok, their business now employs 20 people, who fulfil 500 orders a day.",
      "One big talking point has been the price of the product, which is \u00a315 per bar.",
      "\"It's all handmade, every single design is done by hand,\" Alani says.",
      "\"We use premium ingredients and the process is not like making a Cadbury's bar - you've got the baking, moulding the chocolate to the design and with the filling itself, even the pistachios are hand-picked and processed\".",
      "Speaking to Arabian Business last year, Hamouda said: \"My mother used to make Knafeh, and that's something I wanted to capture my own way.",
      "\"Knafeh was the first flavour we perfected. The crunch, the pistachio, it had to be just right,\" she added.",
      "Despite the product's success, Alani says \"it's been a tough journey\" as the pair have been working together full time while also raising their two children.",
      "\"There's been times where we've wanted to give up, but we said to ourselves 'we'll keep going as long as we can pay the rent' and now we have no regrets as its worked out\"."

      "It's only been a couple of years since the last series of Charlie Brooker's dystopian Netflix show Black Mirror landed. But we're now living in an unpredictable world and a lot can happen in a short space of time.",
      "Renowned for its often savvy and disturbing takes on humanity and our relationship with technology, Black Mirror is back for a seventh series at a time when the pace of change in both politics and tech has left many of us - including lawmakers - struggling to keep up.",
      "In 2011, when the first episode aired, Siri was the new kid on the block and the iPhone 4S had just been launched. Now we have Meta AI embedded in WhatsApp and we're on series 10 of the Apple watch.",
      "Since then, Black Mirror has taken us from creepy memory devices, phone implants and robotic bees to actors-turned-werewolves. And everything in between.",

      "\"I just like the voice and the mannerisms and the way they hold themselves, and the style of acting is so ridiculous, larger than life and tongue in cheek, and yet packed with emotion at the same time.\"",

      "At nearly 88 years old, he is frail but still very dapper in his beige, red and black houndstooth suit with a white silk handkerchief poking out of the pocket, and trademark round yellow glasses perched on his nose.",
      "Britain's most popular artist chuckles a lot, his throaty laugh betraying his many years of smoking.",
      "But, he tells me, as a young student from Bradford at the Royal College of Art in London in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the other students laughed at him.",
      "\"People would mock my accent,\" he says. But it didn't faze him. Hockney knew his worth even then. \"I'd look at their artworks and I'd think, well, if I drew like that, I'd keep my mouth shut.\"",
      "What would the young boy growing up in Bradford think about the life he'd go on to have and the work he'd create?",
      "\"He'd have thought it was pretty daft.\"",
      "For decades, Hockney has been among the world's greatest living artists, and he is now opening his biggest ever show.",
      "As we sit together in a vast gallery at the Louis Vuitton Foundation, a stunning museum designed in reflective glass on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, I ask him what he thinks of the exhibition.",
      "He says it's his best ever, and bursts into laughter again.",
      "It's an expression of pure delight at the 11 rooms filled across four floors with his art - and at being alive to see it. \"I'm just laughing, I mean we made it!\"",
      "Two years ago, when they started planning the exhibition, \"I just thought I probably wouldn't be here\", he says. \"I'm still a smoker, a happy smoker fed up of bossy people telling you what to do... but I didn't know.\"",
      "Hockney is sporting a badge that says \"End Bossiness Soon\" in a gallery dedicated to his love of spring. During the pandemic in 2020, Hockney, who was living in Normandy, used his iPad to paint the trees and flowers blooming as spring arrived.",
      "Those 220 iPad works adorn this gallery, floor to ceiling, the walls bursting with blossom and pure joy, made at a time when the world wasn't feeling very hopeful.",
      "Visitors to the show are greeted at the entrance by Hockney's message from that time: \"Do remember they can't cancel the spring.\"",
      "Hockney has been in poor health. He now has two full-time carers, who have accompanied him to Paris from London, where he now lives. Portraits of both, sitting in their dark blue nurses' uniforms, are the most recent works in the exhibition, made earlier this year.",
      "A self-portrait of Hockney, painting and smoking a cigarette (his two great loves) is also very new.",
      "He still paints for four to six hours every day, he tells me.",
      "He believes you can't judge a painter until their last work is done - but looking at his own work gathered together in Paris, \"I can see what I was always trying to do, really\".",
      "And he promises that \"anybody who has just a little visual sensibility will really enjoy this show\".",
      "His great-nephew Richard Hockney, who has regularly sat for him for 28 years, since he was four years old, including for this exhibition, tells me everyone was determined the artist would make it to Paris.",
      "The night before, Hockney got into a car with his dachshund Tess to be driven across the Channel. And on the morning before they left, they were playing him variations of the jazz classic April in Paris.",
      "Having arrived, \"he is glowing\", Richard says. \"I think this will keep him going for a long, long time, to be honest.\"",
      "And with spring unfolding in the French capital, it's entirely appropriate that the artist known for chronicling spring would open his exhibition, David Hockney 25, now.",
      "This is a man who would fly back from his home in Los Angeles when he heard the hawthorn had begun to blossom in his native Yorkshire, just so he could paint the dazzling spectacle.",
      "Some of his earliest works, including probably his most famous, A Bigger Splash, are also on show in Paris.",
      "That painting, capturing the moment of a swimmer diving into a Santa Monica pool, is on the wall next to Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), the south of France pool painting that broke records when it sold at auction in 2018 for \u00a370m.",
      "Next to those are Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy, another of Hockney's most recognisable works, which depicts his good friend Celia Birtwell and her husband Ossie Clark, with their white cat on his knee.  Seeing them brought together in one room is spectacular.",
      "But the show's main focus is the last 25 years because \"it's 2025\", he says. \"People think it's miserable, but in 1925 they'd had the First World War.\"",
      "It's a visual feast, full of the bright colours and optimism for which Hockney has become known.",
      "\"I've always had it. I've always thought it was an absurd world.\"",
      "A world to laugh at, to look at closely, as Hockney does, and to paint vibrantly.",
      "Some of the iPad paintings are huge. He's \"amazed they could be blown up so big\" when they were created on something so small.",
      "One room is almost pitch dark to show off paintings he did of the Moon, made possible by advances in iPad technology.",
      "There's also a floor devoted to his portraits (about 60), including a 2022 painting of singer Harry Styles in a striped cardigan with a set of pearls around his neck.",
      "But the rest are the friends and family Hockney knows well - Birtwell, her children and grandchildren, the show's curator Sir Norman Rosenthal wearing full regalia, Hockney's partner JP, sometimes with Tess the dog - and two of Richard.",
      "Even though they're related, when he's having a portrait done \"it's very surreal looking at him and then realising you're being painted by David Hockney\", he tells me. \"You know he's always going to create a masterpiece.\"",
      "His great uncle chooses to paint people he loves because \"he sees the truer representation of yourself than you do\". In one of the portraits, Richard is grinning, in a green and white striped T-shirt.",
      "Because Hockney likes Richard's cheeky grin, \"he will sit there and grin at me because he knows it's going to make me grin... after six hours, it aches a bit\".",
      "King Charles went to visit Hockney at home in London before he travelled. \"He's a very nice man, thoughtful, I thought,\" the artist says. \"He does watercolours himself.\"",
      "But he doesn't fancy painting the King. \"The problem there is the majesty, isn't it really? I would find that a bit difficult, I think.\"",
      "He does, though, have a work on the go, a new painting of his great-nephew.",
      "Richard tells me Hockney \"says he's still got a lot of work to do, which is good\", adding: \"As long as that's in his head, then he'll keep going.\"",
      "The artist says he'll finish his painting of his great nephew and then \"I will paint somebody else. And I just carry on.\"",

      "It's that last rule ex-Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe, who's now up front for John Terry's 26ers side, grapples with the most, saying corners should be left \"as God intended\".",
      "In these games, if the ball goes behind off the opposition three times, a penalty is awarded to the attacking team.",
      "But while the shift from the Premier League takes some getting used to, Ibe tells BBC Newsbeat he's impressed with the new format which can \"100%\" bring sport and entertainment closer together.",

      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jackson, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jackson can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",
      "\"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\"",
      "The study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information.",
      "The Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health.",
      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",
      "Emily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry's mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team's carefully designed puzzles.",
      "\"We've both been a part of this since birth,\" Emily says. \"It wasn't a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it's fascinating.\"",
      "Helping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains \"a lot of things are already set.",
      "\"This is the groundwork that will help us support children at the right time.\"",
      "Henry and Jackson finish their puzzles and games and take off their brain-scanning hats.",
      "\"My boys just love coming here,\" says Emily. \"They love all the toys - they get free snacks. So I'll continue coming just as long as they want to.",

    "summary": "The US president vows \"major\" tariffs on imported medicines - raising fears of an increase in costs for Americans.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump says he will soon announce \"major\" tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, a move that could end decades of low-cost global trade in medicines.",
      "For years, most countries, including the US, have imposed few or no tariffs on finished drugs, thanks in part to a 1995 World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement aimed at keeping medicines affordable.",
      "This shift comes after Trump introduced a blanket 10% tariff on other imports last week, as part of a broader effort to bring manufacturing back to the US.",
      "His new \"reciprocal\" tariffs - including a duty of 104% on goods arriving from China - came into force on Wednesday, intensifying a global trade war and further shaking markets.",
      "Pharmaceutical buyers, so far spared from such measures, are now preparing for what may come next.",
      "The US has typically imported vast quantities of finished medicines from India, Europe and China without buyers paying tariffs - although active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), used to make drugs, do face some duties.",
      "Speaking at a fundraiser dinner for his Republican Party on Tuesday, Trump said: \"We're going to be announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals. And when they hear that, they will leave China.\"",
      "He also told reporters on board his Air Force One plane last week that \"pharma\" tariffs would arrive \"at a level that you haven't really seen before\", saying these would be announced \"in the near future\".",
      "In 2024, the US imported $213bn (\u00a3168bn) worth of medicines - more than two and a half times the total a decade earlier.",
      "While short on detail, his comments have rattled buyers, especially those relying on Indian imports. India supplies nearly half of all US generics, or cheaper versions of popular drugs, saving the country billions in healthcare costs.",

      "Indian pharma stocks fell sharply on the news. India sends about a third of its $13bn annual pharma exports to the US, which is a key market.",
      "At the moment, Americans pay little or no tax on imports of Indian medicines - compared with the duty of nearly 11% paid by Indians importing American medicines.",
      "Indian drugmakers warn that tariffs would force them to raise prices, which could ultimately drive up US medical bills. While firms like Cipla and Dr Reddy's have US plants, most say moving production is not viable for low-margin generic drugs.",
      "European drugmakers are also on alert. After a high-level meeting between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and top pharma firms on Tuesday, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) warned that tariffs could shift production away from Europe, and to the US.",
      "The EFPIA, whose members include major pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer, Novartis, and Novo Nordisk - the maker of the star diabetes type 2 drug Ozempic - expressed concerns that rising tariffs could disrupt Europe's role as a key player in global pharmaceutical production.",
      "In 2024, pharmaceuticals were the EU's largest export to the US, worth a reported $127bn (\u00a3100bn).",
      "Major companies have urged the EU to act swiftly, seeking policy changes to enhance Europe's competitiveness and prevent a \"mass exodus\" to the US. They have also expressed concerns about potential EU retaliatory tariffs, which could disrupt supply chains and affect patients on both sides of the Atlantic.",

    "story": [
      "A \"miracle\" baby girl has become the first child in the UK to be born to a mother using a donated womb.",
      "The baby's mum, Grace Davidson, 36, was born without a functioning uterus, and received her sister's womb in 2023 \u2013 in what was then the UK's only successful womb transplant.",
      "Two years after that pioneering operation, Grace gave birth to her first child in February. She and her husband, Angus, 37, have named their daughter Amy after Grace's sister, who donated her womb.",
      "Holding baby Amy - who weighed just over two kilos (four and a half pounds) - for the first time was \"incredible\" and \"surreal\", new mum Grace says.",
      "\"It was quite overwhelming because we'd never really let ourselves imagine what it would be like for her to be here,\" she says. \"It was really wonderful.\"",
      "Grace and Angus, who live in north London but are originally from Scotland, hope to have a second child using the transplanted womb.",
      "The couple initially wished to remain anonymous, but following the safe arrival of baby Amy are now speaking to the BBC about their \"little miracle\".",
      "The surgical team told the BBC they have carried out three further womb transplants using deceased donors since Grace's transplant. They aim to carry out a total of 15 as part of a clinical trial.",
      "Grace was born with a rare condition, Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, where the womb is missing or underdeveloped, but with functioning ovaries. When the BBC first spoke to her in 2018, she was hoping her mother could donate her uterus to allow her to have children - but it proved to be unsuitable.",
      "The BBC met Grace and husband Angus again in 2019 when one of Grace's two sisters, Amy Purdie, was being assessed to find out if she could donate her womb to Grace. Amy and her husband already had two children and did not want any more.",
      "Prior to surgery both sisters had counselling. Grace and Angus also had fertility treatment and still have several embryos in storage. Grace says she was given the option of surrogacy or adoption, but carrying her own baby felt \"really important\".",
      "\"I have always had a mothering instinct,\" she says, \"but for years I had been suppressing it because it was too painful to go there.\"",
      "Womb transplants: how do they work?",
      "The first baby born as a result of a womb transplant was in Sweden in 2014. Since then around 135 such transplants have been carried out in more than a dozen countries, including the US, China, France, Germany, India and Turkey. Around 65 babies have been born.",
      "Originally scheduled to take place in late 2019, the sisters' transplant operation fell through and then looked in doubt for several years during the Covid pandemic.",
      "When it eventually took place, in February 2023, it took a team of more than 30 medics around 17 hours to remove Amy's womb and transplant it to Grace.",
      "Isabel Quiroga, the surgeon who led the transplant team at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, says although the procedure carried risks for both sisters, it was \"life-enhancing and life-creating - and you can't have better than that.\"",
      "Amy says she did not feel the sense of loss some women experience after a hysterectomy, because of the \"dramatic\" and immediate benefits to her sister. Grace had her first ever period within two weeks of the transplant and became pregnant on the first attempt at IVF.",
      "It was \"incredible\" to feel her baby's first kick, she says, adding the entire pregnancy had been \"really special\".",
      "Baby Amy was born by Caesarean section at Queen Charlotte's hospital in west London on 27 February.",
      "\"It was an incredible moment, full of joy,\" says surgeon Isabel Quiroga.",
      "Grace and Angus say they hope to have a second child - as soon as the medical team say the time is right.",
      "The donated womb will be removed after the birth of a second child. This will allow Grace to stop taking the daily immunosuppressants she is currently on to ensure her body does not reject her sister's womb. Taking these drugs can increase the risks of developing some cancers, especially if taken over many years - but surgeon Isabel Quiroga says these risks should return to baseline once the womb is removed.",
      "Prof Richard Smith, a gynaecological surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare, who led the organ retrieval team, has been researching womb transplantation for more than two decades.",
      "He says his team is thrilled about the birth of baby Amy.",
      "\"I'm not often short of words but when the baby came out I was speechless - there were a lot of tears in the theatre that day.",
      "\"The whole thing is astonishing and incredibly moving,\" Prof Smith adds.",
      "He says Amy's birth will give hope to many of the 15,000 women in the UK of childbearing age who do not have a functioning uterus, of whom around 5,000 were born without a womb.",
      "Mr Smith heads a charity called Womb Transplant UK, which paid the NHS costs for Grace's transplant operation. All the medical staff gave their time for free.",
      "He told the BBC around 10 women have embryos in storage or are undergoing fertility treatment, a requirement for being considered for womb transplantation. Each transplant costs around \u00a330,000, he says, and the charity has sufficient funds to do two more.",
      "The surgical team has permission to perform 15 womb transplants as part of a clinical trial, five with living and 10 with deceased donors. No details have been made public about the three women who have so far received wombs from deceased donor organs. NHS Blood and Transplant told the BBC extra consent is sought from families for such rare donations.",
      "Baby Amy's father, Angus, says he and Grace will never be able to thank his wife's sister enough for enabling them to become parents. It was an \"absolute no brainer\" that they would name Amy after her aunt, Angus says.",
      "The baby's middle name is Isabel, after the surgeon who led the womb transplantation team.",
      "For Grace, having baby Amy has brought her even closer to her sister.",

    "summary": "Men are more likely to die prematurely than women - and worse at seeking care when they need it.",
    "story": [
      "This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men's health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health \u2013 and what can be done about it?",
      "Andrew Harrison was running a men's health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms.",
      "\"I was on the first floor,\" he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. \"The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn't want to go through the reception and ask.\"",
      "The anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health \u2013 a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.",
      "Early deaths",
      "In the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure.",
      "These are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75 with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents.",
      "Prof Alan White, who co-founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously.",
      "He cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. \"Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?\"",
      "He says it is too easy to blame men's poor health on their lifestyles, arguing \"it's much more complex than that.\"",
      "He says there are biological reasons \u2013 the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services.",
      "Prof White says: \"Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally \u2013 many go years without seeing a health professional.",
      "\"It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.\"",
      "Stark differences",
      "Machismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy.",
      "\"In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.\"",
      "But he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest \u2013 a larger gap than is seen for women \u2013 and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75.",
      "\"You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,\" he says. \"The way health services are designed isn't working for men.\"",

    "summary": "Analysts warn the unexpected growth could prove short-lived due to the threat of US tariffs and business tax rises.",
    "story": [
      "The UK economy grew by more than predicted in February and exports to the US increased by \u00a3500m as businesses rushed to beat US tariffs.",
      "The economy expanded by 0.5%, with the services sector having a strong month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.",
      "The better-than-expected figures come as the UK economy braces itself for the impact of tariffs imposed on goods imported to the US, with analysts warning that growth could prove short-lived.",
      "Tariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect on 12 March, while a 10% tariff on other goods came into effect this week.",
      "Goods exports from the UK to the US increased for the third consecutive month and are now at the highest level since November 2022, the ONS said.",
      "\"There are clear signs that UK firms increased goods exports to the US ahead of the introduction of tariffs,\" said William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).",
      "\"Data for the past three months shows a 23% increase in the value of goods flowing from the UK across the Atlantic,\" Mr Bain said.",
      "Economists had predicted UK growth of just 0.1% in February, but the ONS said several factors contributed to the surprise rise which was driven by a boost in manufacturing and production.",
      "The government has made growing the UK economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said February's surprise growth was due to computer programming, telecoms and car dealerships in the services sector all having \"strong months\".",
      "She added that manufacturing, electronics and pharmaceutical businesses performed well, and the car making industry also picked up after \"its recent poor performance\".",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the latest growth figures an \"encouraging sign\", but added the government was \"not complacent\".",
      "\"We must go further and faster to kickstart economic growth, provide security for working people and put more money in their pockets,\" she added.",
      "The UK is subject to the blanket 10% tariff on nearly all of its goods being brought into the US, which is expected to hit British exporters and also affect economic growth.",
      "Mr Bain from the BCC said securing a deal with the US and removing trade barriers with the EU would be \"key to cushioning the negative impacts of the sweeping new US tariffs\".",
      "Speaking to reporters, Reeves said: \"We continue to engage with our counterparts in the United States and of course we want to secure the best deal possible for British jobs and British industry and we are absolutely committed and resolved to do everything we can,\" she told reporters.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Alongside the better-than-expected growth, the ONS revised up its figure for January from a contraction of 0.1% to no growth.",
      "Monthly figures alone can be volatile so should be taken in context. The more stable three-month average to February shows growth is up 0.6%.",
      "This would have been considered normal growth a decade ago, but has been elusive in recent years.",
      "However, it suggests that recent talk of a recession has been way off the mark.",
      "But February's figure comes ahead of the impact of tax rises on businesses and household energy and water bill increases on the economy, along with US tariffs.",
      "Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist, said the UK's \"surprisingly strong growth will prove short lived, as rises in tariffs and taxes bite\".",
      "\"The big picture is that the economy has grown in only four of the last nine months and it's hard to see the economy strengthening much from here,\" she said.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: \"Since coming to office, Labour's choices have killed growth stone dead and there is still a long way to go to recover.\"",
      "While there is an acknowledgement that the uncertainty from US tariffs poses threats to the economy, some experts believe it may also create opportunities for a the UK as a stable, growing trade-friendly economy.",
      "Mitchell Barnes runs a 3D printing company in Warwickshire, designing and manufacturing parts for the automotive industry.",
      "Half of the parts made here are exported to the US.",
      "But rather than Trump tariffs, he says it is domestic factors that are hitting his business.",
      "Mr Barnes says this month's changes to National Insurance contributions and the minimum wage mean he may need to rethink his plan to create new jobs at the site.",
      "He had hoped to increase his number of staff from 27 to 100 over the next 18 months, but has now lowered that to between 30 to 40.",

      "But businesses have told the BBC there are backlogs and huge payment delays leaving them out of pocket.",
      "One company told the BBC it is owed nearly \u00a3200,000 by the Access to Work scheme and is worried it may have to close.",
      "Another said it had already been forced to shut down in part due to problems with the programme.",
      "Access to Work was highlighted by ministers as a way of boosting the job prospects of disabled people when the government announced multi-billion pound welfare cuts last month.",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said they had recently introduced a \"streamlined claims process\" to make swifter payments to businesses.",
      "The programme can pay individuals with disabilities and the businesses that employ them for the extra costs associated with being in work.  It covers a broad range of support, from paying for taxis to powered wheelchairs.",

      "It says it is owed \u00a3186,000 by the Access to Work scheme.",
      "\"It's an existential threat to us,\" says chief executive, Sheldon McMullan.  \"If we don't get it, we could potentially close this magical place forever, and that would be a tragedy for the local community and for the government's agenda more broadly.\"",
      "Yateley Industries is part of a nationwide forum of dozens of supported businesses -   companies specialising in employing disabled people.",
      "Mr McMullan says many others are affected by the backlog.",
      "\"The annoying thing is that it's money that's been granted to us,\" he adds.  \"We have the paperwork saying this is what each person's been awarded, but the claim system is not set up for us to draw down the money effectively.\"",
      "Businesses say that as well as poor internal processes at the Department for Work and Pensions, there has also been a large increase in the bureaucracy associated with Access to Work in recent months, with many more forms having to be filled in and then posted \u2013 not uploaded or emailed \u2013 to the DWP.",
      "\"Until ministers realise that they've got this wrong, they're in danger of pushing so many disabled people out of the workplace,\" says Steven McGurk, president of the trade union, Community Union.",
      "\"Its very bureaucratic, very difficult to claim - it's the biggest threat to disabled people's employment.\"",
      "In Newton Abbott in Devon, a cafe that employed people with learning disabilities shut last month. Its founders say new restrictions and problems with Access to Work contributed to the closure.",
      "Sarah Thorp, who set up the No Limits cafe, said the scheme had in recent months started to refuse funding for people who wanted to get some work experience.",
      "The decision came despite the local Job Centre recommending the individuals to the cafe.  The change left the business with a shortfall of \u00a3800 a week.",
      "\"In the last 18 months, we've got 20 people into paid employment, all with disabilities,\" she says.",
      "\"When the issues around work experience changed in the last few months, we had to turn people down because we could not fund the support. It just seems really counter-intuitive when all the rhetoric is around getting disabled adults into work.\"",
      "When the government unveiled cuts and restrictions to disability benefits last month, the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, name-checked the Access to Work scheme as a programme that could help those who will lose out to get a job.",
      "As well as businesses being able to claim, disabled people themselves can apply for help under the scheme.",
      "They are also suffering delays and backlogs; in October, there were 55,000 outstanding applications, according to the DWP.",
      "Some claimants are waiting more than six months to be assessed, with people writing on social media that the delays have resulted in them losing job offers.",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions says it prioritises those who are newly offered a job.",
      "Lucy Earle, 31, is a social media executive for a museum.",
      "She has various disabilities and conditions, including agonising pain in her feet that means she needs to use a wheelchair.",
      "It took six months for her claim to be looked at by Access to Work, and then she was assigned a wheelchair that wasn't suitable and left her upper body in pain.",
      "\"The last few weeks, I haven't been into work because I can't manage the pain of either using the wheelchair that isn't built for me, or being on my feet and not going very far.\"",
      "She credits the Access to Work scheme with helping her stay in employment, but feels they are refusing reasonable requests.",
      "\"They're saying that the benefits are being cut so we can push more people into work, but then also Access to Work is having all these problems.\"",
      "Steve Darling MP, the Lib Dem Work and Pensions spokesperson, says that while the principles behind Access to Work are excellent, \"individuals and businesses are often covering significant sums from their own savings while waiting for payments from Access to Work, which risks pushing people into debt, or businesses even closing down. This is unacceptable.\"",
      "Minister for Social Security and Disability, Sir Stephen Timms, said in February that Access to Work, established in 1994, \"was not in a good shape at the moment.\"",
      "Spending on the programme increased by 41% in 2023/24 to \u00a3257.8m.",
      "\"What we will need to do\u2026is make some fairly significant reforms to Access to Work, look at whether employers can do more. There is quite a big issue here and the current style of Access to Work is unlikely to be sustainable in the long term,\" he said.",

      "The party has stepped up its call for nationalisation of the Port Talbot steel plant, after Chancellor Rachel Reeves put the option on the table for British Steel's Scunthorpe site.",
      "\"If it's good enough for Scunthorpe, why wasn't it good enough for Port Talbot?\" said Plaid's economy spokesman, Luke Fletcher MS.",
      "Tata Steel's blast furnaces at Port Talbot were closed six months ago, with 2,800 jobs lost, after an agreement with the UK government was reached which saw it commit \u00a3500m to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking.",

      "He added Plaid was told a Labour government in both Cardiff and Westminster would save Welsh steel but claimed that, following the general election, \"Labour got in and the deal they put on the table was not that different to the deal the Conservatives put on the table\".",
      "In 2016, the then-Conservative UK government ruled out nationalisation, and the \u00a3500m deal agreed between Tata and the new Labour government last year matched that offered by the outgoing administration.",

      "Rescue talks will restart on Thursday to try to save jobs at the site, which is now home to the UK's only remaining blast furnaces.",
      "The BBC understands the UK government has offered to buy the coal to keep the plant open and, on Wednesday, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves said all options were on the table.",

      "She told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast there were \"definitely similarities\" with Tata - including that both companies were facing massive losses and \"needed to move away from their current technology\" - adding the company \"accepted\" \u00a3500m of government funding, while British Steel \"were reportedly offered the same \u00a3500m and rejected it\", instead asking for \u00a31bn.",

    "story": [
      "A share of the revenue streaming services make from subscription fees should be paid into a fund to support British high-end TV production, an influential group of MPs has said.",
      "In a new report, the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee urged the government to improve support measures for producers while safeguarding the creation of distinctly British content.",
      "It follows an inquiry into the UK TV and film industry which examined the effects of the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon and Apple TV.",
      "The report noted how \"vital\" dramas such as Adolescence are to the country's \"identity, national conversations and talent pipeline\", which they say is now \"under threat\".",
      "It is \"time for streamers to put their money where their mouth is\", the report read, suggesting that streaming companies should pay \"5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance drama with a specific interest to British audiences\".",
      "Chair of the CMS committee, MP Dame Caroline Dinenage, noted how recent \"big box-office blockbusters made in Britain have showcased the UK's world-class film and high-end television industry like never before\".",
      "\"But the boom in inward investment of recent years now risks crowding out our many talented independent British producers,\" she said.",
      "She added: \"While streamers like Netflix and Amazon have proved a valuable addition for the industry and economy, unless the government urgently intervenes to rebalance the playing field, for every Adolescence adding to the national conversation, there will be countless distinctly British stories that never make it to our screens.\"",
      "Adolescence, created by Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham, tells the story of a 13-year-old boy who is charged with killing a female classmate.",
      "This week, it became fourth most popular English-language series in Netflix's history with 114 million views.",
      "A Netflix spokeswoman said: \"The UK is Netflix's biggest production hub outside of North America - and we want it to stay that way.",
      "\"But in an increasingly competitive global market, it's key to create a business environment that incentivises rather than penalises investment, risk taking and success. Levies diminish competitiveness and penalise audiences who ultimately bear the increased costs.\"",
      "The Association for Commercial Broadcasters and On-Demand Services (COBA) said a levy risks damaging streamers' investment in the UK.",
      "Coba executive director Adam Minns said: \"Especially in this economic climate, a levy risks impacting existing content budgets for UK shows, jobs, and growth, along with raising costs for businesses.",
      "\"Ironically, it could actually damage public service broadcaster dramas by reducing co-production budgets at streamers.\"",
      "He added pressure on domestic production stemmed from the real terms decline in the TV licence fee.",
      "A BBC spokesman said the corporation \"continues to invest\" in British content but faced \"significant financial challenges due to pressure on the licence fee and rising industry costs\".",
      "\"It is therefore integral that the BBC and the wider UK creative industries have the support in place to drive growth in the creative economy and support homegrown content and storytelling.\"",
      "The report released on Thursday noted how last year there was a 27% decrease in the number of domestic high-end TV productions made in the UK and a 25% fall in spend.",
      "The calls for greater help come after Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky told BBC News last month that the industry was in crisis, and that public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV could no longer afford to make high-end British drama.",
      "Fair levy or unfair tariff?",
      "The arrival of the streamers into the UK market \"drove up the price of everything\", Kosminsky told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, to the point where the public service broadcasters \"couldn't afford to make their programs anymore, so we need a new pot of money.\"",
      "He underlined how 17 other countries in Europe have imposed a similar levy \"so that public service broadcasters can stay in the game.\"",
      "Speaking on the same programme, former BBC One controller Peter Fincham replied saying he did not agree.",
      "\"I think this sounds to me a little bit like a tariff - to use a more fashionable word - and indeed a form of protectionism.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for the Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) said: \"We acknowledge the challenges facing our brilliant film and TV industry and are working with it through our industrial strategy to consider what more needs to be done to unlock growth and develop the skills pipeline.",
      "\"We thank the committee for its report which we will respond to in due course.\"",
      "'Support freelancers'",
      "The report also noted while the introduction of tax breaks for independent British films, and for film and TV studios in England may have helped, it was not a \"silver bullet\" for solving many of the issues facing British producers.",
      "As well as providing greater support and resources for UK TV production workforces, it also suggested that lawmakers should consider cutting VAT on cinema tickets as well as doing more to meet the challenges posed by AI.",
      "Commenting on the report, Paul W Fleming, general secretary of Equity, which represents British performers, said the government should \"heed the call\" for the licensing of creative works in all cases where they are used to train artificial intelligence models.",
      "\"AI is being built illegally by stealing Equity members' life's works,\" he said.",
      "Big tech firms \"must be held to account\", he added, \"brought to the table and made to pay creators what they owe.\"",
      "The cross-party committee recommended the government and British Film Institute (BFI) should launch a national awareness campaign, highlighting the employment opportunities offered by film and high-end TV, and \"the range of skills the industry requires\".",
      "It stressed how the industry \"benefits hugely from the flexibility afforded by a predominantly freelance workforce\" and therefore more should be done to \"support freelancers when they are out of work\"; such as the introduction of a minimum hourly wage or guaranteed basic income.",
      "Head of industry union Bectu, Philippa Childs, said: \"We welcome this timely and incisive report from the committee which identifies many of the urgent challenges currently facing the industry and its workforce.\"",
      "She added: \"It's essential that the industry does not become too skewed towards large streamers, which risks the homogenisation of content and the loss of much of the UK's unique and distinctive output.\"",

      "Senedd members will have to decide whether to give consent for Labour MP Kim Leadbeater's legislation to apply in Wales, should it be agreed by the UK Parliament.",
      "Last October Senedd members - including First Minister Eluned Morgan and Health Secretary Jeremy Miles - voted against the broader principle of assisted dying.",
      "If agreed by MPs, Leadbeater's legislation would make it legal for over-18s who are terminally ill to be given assistance to end their own life.",
      "Separately, amendments passed in March by MPs could also give Senedd politicians and ministers power over the date for when most of the law comes into force.",
      "The UK and Welsh governments have remained neutral on the backbench legislation. Miles and Leadbeater met to discuss the bill earlier this week.",
      "Assisted dying move defeated in Senedd vote",
      "Assisted dying law could take four years to implement",
      "On Wednesday the Welsh government published documentation confirming Labour ministers in Cardiff believe Leadbeater's bill requires the consent of the Senedd.",
      "Although it amends the law regarding suicide - something which the UK Parliament is responsible for in Wales - the Welsh government says parts of the law tread into matters that the Senedd is usually responsible for.",
      "That includes the chief medical officer drawing up guidance on how the act operates, and powers for Welsh ministers to provide assisted dying services.",
      "It means that the Senedd needs to pass what is known as a \"legislative consent motion\" (LCM).",
      "When they were first envisaged parliament was not meant to legislate in devolved areas without the Senedd's permission via an LCM, but it is not legally binding.",
      "If the LCM was rejected it could be ignored by the UK Parliament, although that would be politically difficult.",
      "Westminster Labour has promised to \"strengthen\" the convention behind LCMs at the last general election.",
      "'Respect democracy'",
      "A committee of MPs has been amending the bill. In March it agreed by a small margin that Welsh ministers should have powers over when to start most of the legislation's provisions.",
      "Under the amendment, which was backed by 12 votes to 11 and proposed by Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney, the Senedd will have to vote on regulations to bring the law into force.",
      "Such a decision would only take place if the law gets through the UK Parliament - itself not certain - while the LCM would likely be held earlier.",
      "The proposal was opposed by UK Labour ministers Stephen Kinnock and Sarah Sackman, as well as Leadbeater herself.",
      "At the committee in March, Olney said: \"Regardless of where we stand on assisted dying, we should respect democracy.",
      "Referring to the October vote, she said: \"The people of Wales, through their elected representatives - acting as they should, as representatives - have voted against assisted dying.",
      "\"We should respect that choice and not impose it on them, in whole or in part, without their consent.\"",
      "But Aberavon MP Kinnock said the amendment could potentially \"create a disparity, particularly in relation to the introduction of the criminal offences, and a lack of certainty\".",
      "Ministers and Senedd 'could block bill'",
      "The amendment followed evidence to the committee by Aberyswyth University emeritus professor Emyr Lewis, who asked the MPs to consider whether ministers should be given powers over when the legislation begins to apply when the Senedd had rejected the broader principle.",
      "He told BBC Wales he had questioned whether it would be \"constitutionally appropriate\" for Parliament to have ignored the earlier Senedd vote.",
      "\"We know the Senedd has rejected this. Is it right that... the parliament in London should impose, if you want to put it that way, on Wales this change in the law, which is going to have far reaching effects?\"",
      "He said that if the Senedd supported the bill it could be brought in in Wales, should it be passed by MPs, as it would be in England.",
      "\"If, however, the feeling in Wales remains as it was when the matter was voted on before then this very morally and legally far reaching bill won't be brought into force in Wales if the people of Wales don't want it.\"",
      "He told BBC Wales that the Olney amendment could give ministers in Cardiff powers to block the legislation.",
      "The law professor said: \"Welsh ministers could block it and so could the Senedd in Wales.\"",
      "The Senedd vote last October saw 26 Members of the Senedd opposing Labour MS Julie Morgan's motion with 19 MSs in support versus nine abstentions.",
      "Leadbeater's bill is narrower than Morgan's motion, specifying it would apply to over-18s who are expected to die within six months, with a number of measures intended to act as safeguards.",
      "Morgan's vote proposed that suffering \"intolerably\" from an incurable physical condition should have the option of an assisted death. Former counsel general Mick Antoniw has said he expects a different debate.",
      "The difference between the law and the earlier Senedd vote was acknowledged in the committee's debate on Olney's amendment.",
      "Leadbeater said the Morgan motion was \"very different from the legislation before this Parliament\".",
      "She said changes made to the bill allowing ministers powers to make regulations about voluntary assisted dying services would \"hopefully also provide some reassurance on issues around devolution\".",
      "No date has been set for the LCM.",
      "A spokesperson for Kim Leadbeater said discussions with the Welsh government \"have been very constructive and Kim is determined to respect the devolution agreement and work with Welsh ministers in the interests of terminally ill people in both England and Wales\".",
      "The Welsh government said: \"This is a complex issue with many moral, operational, constitutional and legal considerations, and like the UK government we have adopted a neutral position.\""

      "In an open letter, Labour MPs from three groups said a \"gear shift\" was needed to reap the benefits of digital identification.",
      "The idea of digital ID for all has long been backed by former Labour Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair and former Conservative leader William Hague.",
      "But the BBC understands the government has no plans to introduce mandatory digital ID.",
      "The letter said while the government had made \"great strides\" on digitising identification, \"the time has come for a more comprehensive programme\".",
      "\"The truth is we are moving to an era of digital ID,\" Jake Richards, one of the Labour MPs who signed the letter, told the BBC.",

      "In the open letter, the Labour MPs said \"this government will only succeed if it is able to get a grip on illegal migration\".",
      "A key part of this, the letter said, \"must be tackling illegal off-the-books employment, which is a major draw for migrants entering our country unlawfully\".",

      "The UK appeared to have come off lightly compared to other economies.",

      "Those most directly exposed in the UK to this trade war are British businesses - from carmakers to food producers - selling goods into the US.",
      "As American importers buying their products pay 10% more, they face a dilemma of whether to squeeze profits, share the pain across the supply chain or hope customers will be prepared to pay higher prices.",

      "Growth",
      "The blow to growth via trade will likely be less marked in the UK than elsewhere, in part because of what Britain sells to America.",
      "Two-thirds of British exports to the US are services - the likes of banking, insurance  and advertising - which aren't subject to tariffs. The UK's success in this area makes it a particular area of strength in its trade portfolio.",
      "But that strength can also be a weakness.",
      "Some services exports are linked to goods; think after-sales services or marketing. The demand for those could be affected by tariffs in the US.",
      "Sales of services exports could more broadly be impacted elsewhere if demand from other countries suffers.",
      "Some in the advertising industry are already fretting because spending on their services are often the first to suffer when there are budget cutbacks.",
      "And that trade success could be a vulnerability.",
      "The Bank of England notes that the size of the UK's export sector compared to the economy, and its financial sector, means it may be susceptible to risks to financial stability from weaker global growth.",
      "It's for all these reasons that Chancellor Rachel Reeves is warning that growth in the UK will be hit, even if we're now on a level playing field with other countries in terms of the 10% tariff.",
      "That's worrying, not just for households and businesses, but for the chancellor's own sums - weaker growth puts more of a strain on the public finances.",

      "And the wild swings in stock markets around the world, egged on by the heightened risk of global recession, have not been good news for investors in the UK.",
      "When share prices drop, they reduce the value of products such as ISAs and pension funds.",
      "But as seasoned analysts caution, those sorts of funds are long-term ones. Swings in the value of investments tend to get smoothed out over time - and most people aren't drawing from such funds day-to-day. On the whole, households here are less exposed to the stock market directly than those in America are.",
      "Interest rates",
      "There may be a silver lining to the market volatility.",
      "Prices of oil and commodities such as copper and sugar have been falling.",
      "That may bode well for lower inflation, as might the diversion of cheap goods from countries struggling to sell in the US.",
      "Against a backdrop of weaker growth, investors are speculating that the Bank of England may cut interest rates four more times this year, touting potential relief for millions of households.",
      "The Bank of England itself has noted that, in any case, British households are well placed to weather the storm - our debt relative to our incomes is at its lowest level since 2001.",
      "Moreover, the banking system, the Bank judges, is well placed to absorb shocks. Lessons from the 2008 financial crisis have been learnt.",

    "summary": "Countries break ten-year deadlock to agree measures to reduce commercial shipping emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.",
      "The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.",
      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",
      "Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".",
      "Shipping agrees net-zero goal but critics unmoved",
      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water atoms to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",
      "Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.",
      "\"It is a difficult set of decisions, but it is the first regulation of its kind and that is to be celebrated,\" he said.",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.",
      "\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",
      "It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken.",
      "Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations.",
      "The US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised.",

    "story": [
      "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.",
      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",
      "Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.",
      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",

    "summary": "The BBC finds evidence of fraud in the production of a \"green\" diesel meant to cut emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.",
      "HVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.",
      "But industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.",
      "And data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.",
      "Europe used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.",
      "In response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".",
      "HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.",
      "UK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.",
      "Its green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.",
      "But industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.",
      "That would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.",
      "This palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.",
      "They said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.",
      "Another whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.",
      "\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.",
      "\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"",
      "As well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce.",
      "The figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.",
      "EU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.",
      "But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.",
      "This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.",
      "\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".",
      "\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"",
      "Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.",
      "It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.",
      "But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.",
      "\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.",
      "\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"",
      "This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.",
      "Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.",
      "\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.",
      "The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.",
      "In a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".",
      "In the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.",
      "The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.",
      "It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.",
      "In response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".",

      "The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on.",
      "And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise.",
      "\"Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell,\" said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst.",
      "The scan has been studied for a new documentary by National Geographic and Atlantic Productions called Titanic: The Digital Resurrection.",

      "Scans of Titanic reveal wreck as never seen before",
      "The wreck, which lies 3,800m down in the icy waters of the Atlantic, was mapped using underwater robots.",
      "More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the \"digital twin\", which was revealed exclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023.",
      "Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.",
      "The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.",
      "But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.",
      "The new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.",
      "\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"",
      "The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.",
      "Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.",
      "Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.",
      "The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.",
      "Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.",
      "This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.",
      "All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.",

      "\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"",
      "A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.",
      "It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.",
      "\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.",
      "The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.",
      "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.",
      "But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.",
      "\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.",
      "\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"",
      "Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.",
      "The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.",
      "Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.",
      "The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.",

      "\"You can reconstruct [it], but it's not good enough to do anything else with.\"",
      "Instead, he added, the de-extinction team used new synthetic biology technology - using the ancient DNA to identify key segments of code that they could edit into the biological blueprint of a living animal, in this case a grey wolf.",
      "\"So what Colossal has produced is a grey wolf, but it has some dire wolf-like characteristics, like a larger skull and white fur,\" said Dr Rawlence. \"It's a hybrid.\"",
      "Dr Beth Shapiro, a biologist from Colossal Biosciences, said that this feat does represent de-extinction, which she described as recreating animals with the same characteristics.",
      "\"A grey wolf is the closest living relative of a dire wolf - they're genetically really similar - so we targeted DNA sequences that lead to dire wolf traits and then edited grey wolf cells... then we cloned those cells and created our dire wolves.\"",
      "According to Dr Rawlence though, dire wolves diverged from grey wolves anywhere between 2.5 to six million years ago.",
      "\"It's in a completely different genus to grey wolves,\" he said. \"Colossal compared the genomes of the dire wolf and the grey wolf, and from about 19,000 genes, they determined that 20 changes in 14 genes gave them a dire wolf.\"",

      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",

      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",

    "summary": "The BBC finds evidence of fraud in the production of a \"green\" diesel meant to cut emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.",
      "HVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.",
      "But industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.",
      "And data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.",
      "Europe used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.",
      "In response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".",
      "HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.",
      "UK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.",
      "Its green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.",
      "But industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.",
      "That would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.",
      "This palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.",
      "They said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.",
      "Another whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.",
      "\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.",
      "\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"",
      "As well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce.",
      "The figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.",
      "EU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.",
      "But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.",
      "This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.",
      "\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".",
      "\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"",
      "Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.",
      "It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.",
      "But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.",
      "\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.",
      "\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"",
      "This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.",
      "Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.",
      "\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.",
      "The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.",
      "In a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".",
      "In the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.",
      "The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.",
      "It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.",
      "In response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".",

      "More than 40 percent of the world's electricity was generated without burning fossil fuels in 2024, according to a new report from think-tank Ember.",
      "But carbon dioxide emissions, which warm the planet, have risen to an all time high, the report says, with hot weather pushing up the overall demand for power.",
      "That meant an increase in the use of fossil fuel burning power stations.",
      "Solar power continues to be the fastest-growing energy source, with the amount of electricity it generates doubling in the last three years.",
      "\"Solar power has become the engine of the global energy transition,\" said Phil Macdonald, the managing director of Ember.",
      "\"Amid the noise, it's essential to focus on the real signal. Hotter weather drove the fossil generation increase in 2024, but we're very unlikely to see a similar jump in 2025.\"",
      "In a separate report, the European Copernicus climate service said March 2025 was the second hottest on record, extending a spell of record or near record breaking temperatures.",
      "Ember is a global energy think tank which has been predicting for several years that emissions of the climate warming gas carbon dioxide were about to start falling.",

      "China continues to dominate the growth of solar with more than half of the increase taking place there. India's solar capacity doubled between 2023 and 2024.",
      "Though it is growing fast, solar remains a relatively small part of the global energy mix contributing just under 7% of global supply \u2013 that's the same as powering the entire country of India.",
      "Wind contributes just over 8%, with hydropower contributing 14% making it the largest source of clean energy. Both hydro-electric and nuclear power (9%) are growing much more slowly than wind and solar.",
      "Back to the 1940s",
      "The report says that clean energy sources contributed more than 40% of global electricity generation for the first time since the 1940s. Back then demand was much lower, and hydroelectric power stations contributed a significant share.",
      "The big picture is that the rise in the global demand for electricity continues to outpace the growth in renewable energy.",
      "That means that though the percentage generated by clean power has risen to 40.9% the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted has yet to start falling.",
      "According to the Ember report global demand for electricity rose by 4% in 2024.",
      "This was partly due to an increased use of air conditioning in what was a particularly hot year. That meant that fossil fuel generation, mostly coal (34%) and gas (22%), increased by 1.4% and global emissions of the climate warming gas CO2 rose to an all time high of 14.6bn tonnes.",

      "The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on.",
      "And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise.",
      "\"Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell,\" said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst.",

      "Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.",
      "The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.",
      "But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.",
      "The new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.",
      "\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"",

      "Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.",
      "Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.",
      "The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.",

      "A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.",
      "It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.",
      "\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.",
      "The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.",
      "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.",
      "But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.",
      "\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.",
      "\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"",
      "Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.",
      "The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.",
      "Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.",
      "The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.",

      "Mr Musk sued OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman last year in a bid to stop him from changing its corporate structure. He co-founded OpenAI with Mr Altman but left several years ago.",
      "The countersuit opens up a new front in the high-stakes - and long-running - battle between two Silicon Valley heavyweights, who both say they are acting in the best interests of OpenAI and the public.",
      "\"Elon's nonstop actions against us are just bad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit,\" OpenAI said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Today, we countersued to stop him.\"",
      "Last week, a federal judge in Oakland, California, set a March 2026 trial date in Mr Musk's suit in a bid to fast-track the legal fight.",

      "She also said that she expected Mr Musk to give evidence in the case.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:37:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Some analysts say that if costs incurred by tariffs pass to consumers, US iPhone prices could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.",
      "Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.",
      "The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
      "And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.",
      "Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.",
      "\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.",
      "Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.",
      "And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.",
      "While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025.",
      "\"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.",
      "Where are iPhones made?",
      "The US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research.",
      "It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.",
      "Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years.",
      "India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs.",
      "As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days.",
      "Reuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US.",
      "Amid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost.",
      "The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.",
      "How exposed is Apple to tariffs?",
      "Trump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing.",
      "However, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly.",
      "This, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat.",
      "Apple committed a $500bn (\u00a3385bn) investment in the US in February - which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing.",
      "But Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money.",
      "\"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" he wrote on X on 3 April.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Will iPhone prices go up?",
      "Apple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.",
      "Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them.",
      "\"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.",
      "But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.",
      "\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"",
      "Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers.",
      "Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.",
      "They estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046.",
      "While some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.",
      "What can consumers do about it?",
      "There's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen.",
      "This hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones.",
      "The BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike.",
      "Anthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone.",
      "\"I really didn't need a phone... but I'm not ready to pay double the price,\" he said.",
      "Bruce Conroy, a hair stylist, told the BBC that even if prices had risen considerably he \"would have stuck with Apple products\" - though potentially delayed his purchase of a new iPad.",
      "\"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.",
      "We will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost.",
      "But if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices.",
      "CCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market.",
      "The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost.",
      "The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions.",
      "\"The path of least resistance would be to keep the smartphone they already have for longer,\" said Mr Wood.",

      "Dame Rachel said children were racking up hours of screen time at home instead, and that \"the people with the real power here are the parents\".",
      "Her comments come as the general secretary of the UK's largest teaching union said a government ban on phones would \"take the pressure off schools\".",
      "Dame Rachel told BBC Radio 5Live that the vast majority schools were already restricting and banning phones, adding: \"Blanket ban if you want, but they're doing it.\"",
      "The former head teacher cast doubt on how effective a ban would be on those schools without strict policies, noting that the government can impose rules but \"unless a headteacher really believes it, they won't do it properly\".",

      "\"These children are not spending these hours on their phones while sat in school,\" Dame Rachel said in a new report.",
      "She said schools should educate young people about online risks - but parents and carers needed more help to manage their children's online habits and technology companies must \"take responsibility for making the online world safe\".",
      "She added that she would back any head teacher's decision to ban phones, but added: \"It should always be their choice, based on their knowledge of what's best for the children in their own classrooms, not a direction imposed nationally by the government.\"",
      "However, her report also recommended the government should \"conduct more research into the potential benefits of wider restrictions on children's use of phones, particularly social media\".",

      "A government spokesperson said social media platforms already have to take down illegal material under the Online Safety Act, and the same law would soon protect children from other harmful online content.",
      "And the government has said there is already guidance on how schools can restrict the use of phones, which head teachers can decide how to put into practice.",
      "But Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, said he believed a government ban on smartphones in schools would \"assist parents, but also take the pressure off schools\".",
      "\"Most schools do have rules in place, but [a ban] would create a uniformity across the school system, which would be very important and ensure that a new culture was developed in which smartphones were not in possession during school time,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The UK government sought to keep details of its row with Apple over requested access to its encrypted cloud storage tool private.",
    "story": [
      "A judge has sided with a coalition of civil liberties groups and news organisations - including the BBC - and ruled a legal row between the UK government and Apple over data privacy cannot be held in secret.",
      "The Home Office wants the right to be able access information secured by Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system, citing powers given to it under the Investigatory Powers Act.",
      "At the moment Apple has no such capability - such data can only be accessed by the user - and says it does not want to create what it calls a \"backdoor\" into ADP because of concerns it would eventually be exploited by hackers and criminals.",
      "The government's request prompted fierce criticism from privacy campaigners and some US politicians.",
      "In February, Apple pulled ADP from the UK and in March it launched legal proceedings against the government, in a case which is being heard by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.",
      "The government argued it would damage national security if the nature of the legal action and the parties to it were made public - what are known as the \"bare details of the case\".",
      "In a ruling published on Monday morning, the tribunal rejected that request - pointing to the extensive media reporting of the row and highlighting the legal principle of open justice.",
      "\"It would have been a truly extraordinary step to conduct a hearing entirely in secret without any public revelation of the fact that a hearing was taking place,\" it states.",
      "\"For the reasons that are set out in our private judgement, we do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security,\" it later adds.",
      "In a statement the Home Office said it would not comment on legal proceedings or individual notices but said its \"first priority is to keep people safe.\"",
      "\"There are longstanding and targeted investigatory powers that allow the authorities to investigate terrorists, paedophiles and the most serious criminals and they are subject to robust safeguards including judicial authorisations and oversight to protect people's privacy,\" it added.",
      "It stressed it was not seeking blanket data access - and any requests to view individual accounts protected by ADP would need a court approved warrant.",
      "Wider implications",
      "Civil and digital rights organisations in the UK, which criticised the Home Office request, have welcomed Monday's ruling.",
      "They, along with news organisations  - including the BBC - made legal representations for the case to be heard in public.",
      "\"This is bigger than the UK and Apple,\" said Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group.",
      "\"The Court's judgment will have implications for the privacy and security of millions of people around the world.\"",
      "The Open Rights Group campaigned alongside Big Brother Watch and Index on Censorship against the proposal to hold the hearing in secret.",
      "Big Brother Watch interim director Rebecca Vincent says the judgement is \"effectively chipping away at the pervasive climate of secrecy surrounding the Investigatory Powers Tribunal's consideration of the Apple case\".",
      "\"The Home Office's order to break encryption represents a massive attack on the privacy rights of millions of British Apple users, which is a matter of significant public interest and must not be considered behind closed doors,\" she adds.",
      "Apple declined to comment.",
      "In a previous statement it told the BBC:  \"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom.",
      "\"As we have said many times before we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.\"",
      "How does ADP work?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data such as photos and notes stored in their iCloud accounts.",
      "It uses what is known as end-to-end encryption (E2EE), meaning only the user has the \"key\" necessary to unscramble and access the data.",
      "E2EE is also used to protect data on messaging services including WhatsApp and Signal.",
      "It makes the data very secure - but poses a problem for law enforcement agencies.",
      "They can request to view information stored with lower levels of protection - but companies such as Apple have no way of allowing them to view files secured with E2EE because they do not possess such a capability.",
      "Campaign group Privacy International said the right of individuals also needed to be protected - and welcomed today's ruling.",

      "When Omri Miran finally opens his WhatsApp account, he's going to receive a torrent of messages.",
      "Photos of his daughters. Late night musings from his wife, Lishay, as she lies in bed. Snapshots from an Israeli family life that's gone on for 18 painful months without him.",
      "Lishay started sending the messages three weeks after Hamas gunmen violently snatched Omri from their home in Kibbutz Nahal Oz, on 7 October 2023.",
      "She calls the chat Notes to Omri. She's lost count of the number of messages she's sent.",
      "\"My love, there are so many people you'll need to meet when you come back,\" she wrote at the end of October 2023.",
      "\"Amazing people who are helping me. Strangers who have become as close as can be.\"",
      "Three-and-a-half months later, she posted a message from the couple's eldest daughter.",
      "\"Roni just said goodnight to you at the window like every night. She says you don't hear her and she doesn't see you\u2026 You're really missing from her life and it's getting harder for her to deal with your absence.\"",
      "Friday was Omri's birthday. His second in captivity. As he turns 48, somewhere in the tunnels of Gaza, Lishay will be writing again, with tales of two daughters who were still babies when he last saw them.",
      "Released hostages say Omri was seen alive last July. Lishay's belief in her husband's survival seems unshakeable, but this is the toughest time of the year. Not just Omri's birthday, but also the eve of Pesach (Passover), when Jews celebrate the Biblical story of Exodus, in which Moses led their ancestors out of slavery in Egypt.",
      "\"You know, Pesach is the holiday of freedom,\" Lishay says when we meet in a park near Tel Aviv's Hostages Square.",
      "\"I don't feel free. I don't think anyone in Israel can feel free.\"",

      "Danny, Omri's father, crossed out both, and wrote 48.",
      "Nearby, preparations were well under way for a symbolic Passover Seder, or ritual feast.",
      "A long table was being set, with places for each of the remaining 59 hostages still in Gaza (of whom 24 are believed to be alive).",
      "The square is full of symbols: a mock-up of a Gaza tunnel, tents to represent the Nova music festival where hundreds were killed.",
      "Along with a merchandise stall to support the families and a \"virtual reality hostage experience\", it's all part of a collective effort to keep the plight of the missing in the public eye and maintain political pressure on the Israeli government.",
      "Lishay and her daughters have yet to return to the house where family life was blown apart in a few traumatic hours, 18 months ago.",
      "But Lishay says she goes back to Nahal Oz from time to time to commune with her husband.",
      "The kibbutz is just 700m from the border with Gaza. It's as close as she can get to Omri.",
      "\"I can feel him over there,\" she says. \"I can speak with him.\"",
      "After a ceasefire came into effect in mid-January, the border was quiet. Lishay allowed herself to hope, even though she knew Omri's age meant that he would not be among the first to be freed.",
      "But the ceasefire ended after just two months. Now the border area - which Israelis call \"the Gaza pocket\" - echoes once more to the sounds of war, reigniting the deepest fears of all hostage families.",
      "\"I was terrified,\" she says of her most recent trip.",
      "Lishay is careful not to condemn her government, as some hostage families have. But she says that when she realised the war had resumed, she was \"really angry\".",
      "When Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Hungary's Viktor Orban last week, he posted that the two men had discussed \"the Hungarian hostage\", a reference to Omri's dual Israel-Hungarian citizenship.",
      "For Lishay, it stung.",
      "\"I was really, really hard to see this,\" she says. \"Omri has a name. He's not just a hostage.\"",
      "In a Passover message delivered on Friday, Netanyahu once again promised the families that hostages would return and Israel's enemies would be defeated.",
      "Recent days have seen talk of another ceasefire deal, but it doesn't feel imminent.",
      "\"The last time that it happened,\" Lishay says, referring to the first ceasefire deal in November 2023, \"we waited more than a year for another agreement. So now we are going to wait one year more? They can't survive over there.\"",
      "For now, it seems her WhatsApp messages to Omri are destined to remain unopened.",
      "But that doesn't stop her looking for the grey ticks to turn blue.",

      "Appearing to confirm this was the reason for her firing, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell linked to the Military.com article in a post on X, writing: \"Actions [that] undermine the chain of command or to subvert President [Donald] Trump's agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense.\"",

      "His comments come after two Chinese fighters were captured earlier this week - marking Kyiv's first official allegation that China was supplying Russia with manpower.",
      "Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, Zelensky reiterated his claim that there are \"many more\" Chinese nationals engaged in the conflict, based on information gathered by his government.",
      "Responding on Thursday, a Chinese government spokesman said they \"advise relevant parties to correctly and soberly understand China's role and not to make irresponsible remarks\".",
      "\"China is neither the creator nor a party to the Ukrainian crisis. We are a staunch supporter and active promoter of the peaceful resolution of the crisis,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian.",

      "On Wednesday Zelensky had told reporters that the \"the Chinese issue is serious.\"",
      "\"There are 155 people with surnames, with passport data - 155 Chinese citizens who are fighting against Ukrainians on the territory of Ukraine,\" he said, according to remarks reported by Interfax.",

      "He also released on X a video of what appeared to be an interrogation of the two captured Chinese soldiers.",
      "Speaking in Mandarin Chinese, the soldiers described their background and how they were captured.",

      "The other mentions he was in a group that included two other Chinese soldiers before they were separated in the chaos. \"Everyone dispersed, I don't know if they're dead or not,\" he said.",
      "He said he eventually surrendered along with Russian soldiers.",
      "Zelensky said on X that: \"Ukraine believes that such blatant involvement of Chinese citizens in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine during the war of aggression is a deliberate step towards the expansion of the war, and is yet another indication that Moscow simply needs to drag out the fighting.\"",

      "The charity in question denied raising money for weapons or ammunition, saying it was focused on humanitarian aid and disaster relief.",
      "The FSB is thought to have discovered the transaction on her phone.",
      "In exchange, the US freed Arthur Petrov, a dual German-Russian citizen arrested in Cyprus in 2023. He was accused of illegally exporting microelectronics to Russia for manufacturers working with the Russian military.",
      "Russian TASS news agency said President Vladimir Putin had pardoned Ms Karelina.",
      "The prisoner swap took place in Abu Dhabi in the early hours of Thursday.",

    "story": [
      "A tattoo belonging to a man from Derbyshire has appeared in a US government document used to identify members of a notorious Venezuelan gang - despite the man having no connection to the group.",
      "Pete Belton, 44, from Ilkeston says he was shocked to find his forearm featured in a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) document used to help identify alleged members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a transnational criminal organisation.",
      "\"I'm just an average middle-aged man from Derbyshire,\" he told BBC Verify.",
      "Mr Belton said it was a \"bit strange, bit funny at first\" but is now worried the family trip he booked to Miami with his wife and daughter in August might end up \"being a six month all-inclusive holiday to Guantanamo\".",
      "The Trump administration has already deported hundreds of alleged gang members to a high-security jail in El Salvador. Lawyers for some of those deportees say they have been incorrectly identified as TdA members based on their tattoos.",
      "Mr Belton's tattoo - a clock face with the date and time of his daughter's birth - was included in a set of nine images for \"detecting and identifying\" TdA members. Other tattoos featured stars, crowns and a Michael Jordan \"jumpman\" logo.",
      "\"Open source material has depicted TdA members with a combination of the below tattoos,\" states the document which appeared in court filings.",
      "But reverse image searches show that several of the pictures first appeared on tattoo websites with no obvious links to Venezuela or TdA.",
      "One of them led BBC Verify to an Instagram post by a Nottingham-based tattoo artist who posted about Mr Belton's tattoo nearly a decade ago.",
      "The tattoo image in the DHS document is worse quality than the Instagram post, which was shared in 2016, but it is clearly the same arm and features the same clock face tattoo.",
      "The same image of Mr Belton's tattoo also appeared in a September 2024 report by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) about TdA activity.",
      "BBC Verify contacted both the US DHS and the Texas DPS about the source of the images, but did not receive a response.",
      "But in an email the DHS said it was confident in its law enforcement's intelligence and that its \"assessments go well beyond just gang affiliate tattoos and social media.\"",
      "It's unclear exactly how Mr Belton's tattoo ended up in the US documents, but he's worried about being linked to the gang.",
      "\"In my head I'm thinking if I'm working in border force and I saw me walking through I'd think 'hey up we've got one, he's the one in the document'.\"",
      "He provided multiple images of the tattoo to prove that it's his - and he says that he has no association to the Venezuelan group.",
      "The US government hasn't deported anyone based on their tattoos alone, according to comments from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official in a court filing last month.",
      "However, court documents show immigration officials are employing a points-based system known as the \"Alien Enemy Validation Guide\" to determine if someone is linked to the Venezuelan gang.",
      "It includes a scorecard, and according to the document, eight points across a number of categories could be grounds for arrest or deportation.",
      "Half of these points can be given if a \"subject has tattoos denoting membership or loyalty to TdA\".",
      "The document says if all eight points come from the symbolism category, which includes tattoos, then further consultation should be taken before designating someone as a member of TdA.",
      "Venezuelan investigative journalist Ronna Risquez, who wrote a book on TdA's origins, said tattoos alone are not evidence of membership.",
      "\"TdA does not have tattoos that identifies the gang,\" she said.",
      "\"To confirm whether a person is a member of TdA, authorities must conduct a police investigation to determine whether they have a criminal record. A tattoo, their clothing, or their nationality are not proof.\"",
      "However, there have been cases where lawyers have argued that people have been wrongfully identified based on their tattoos and were subsequently deported.",
      "US media have reported on a man whose lawyers say was deported because of a crown tattoo which was inspired by the Real Madrid football club logo.",
      "Another case saw a makeup artist sent to El Salvador after his a crown tattoo with the words \"mum\" and \"dad\" was used by US officials as evidence for gang membership, according to his attorneys.",
      "Back in Derbyshire, Mr Belton says his family have considered cancelling their trip to the US due to the potential risks, but they are going to monitor how the story develops.",
      "\"Hopefully now they'd realise I'm not a Venezuelan gangster but I've seen crazier things happen in the news recently, so we're just going to wait and see.\"",

      "The clinic has launched an investigation and Mr Knaap said the clinic was confident it was an isolated incident.",
      "Monash said when the incident was discovered it activated its crisis management team and within a week the Brisbane clinic  started meeting affected patients to apologise and offer them support, the firm said.",
      "The company has also reported the incident to relevant regulators, including the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee, and voluntarily reported the incident to the new Queensland assisted reproductive technology regulator.",
      "Last year, Monash IVF reached a A$56m (\u00a326.8m) settlement in a landmark class action with 700 former patients for destroying embryos after inaccurate genetic testing.",

      "In 2021 there were 20,690 babies born as a result of IVF in Australia and New Zealand, according to a report by the University of New South Wales."

      "A controversial bill seeking to reinterpret New Zealand's founding document, which established the rights of both M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori in the country, has been defeated at its second reading.",
      "The Treaty Principles Bill was voted down 112 votes to 11, days after a government committee recommended that it should not proceed.",
      "The proposed legislation sought to legally define the principles of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi - causing widespread outrage that saw more than 40,000 people taking part in a protest outside parliament last year.",
      "The bill had already been widely expected to fail, with most major political parties committed to voting it down.",
      "Members of the right-wing Act Party, which tabled it, were the only MPs to vote for it at the second reading on Thursday. Act's leader David Seymour has promised to continue campaigning on the issue.",
      "\"I believe this Bill or something like it will pass one day because there are not good arguments against its contents,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Tensions were high during a parliamentary debate on the bill in November. Labour MP Willie Jackson was told to leave after refusing to withdraw a comment he made calling Seymour a \"liar\".",
      "Labour leader Chris Hipkins said the proposed legislation would forever \"be a stain on our country\", while Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori (The M\u0101ori Party) MP Hana R\u0101whiti Maipi-Clarke - who gained international attention for starting a haka in parliament at the bill's first reading - said it had been \"annihilated\".",
      "\"Instead of dividing and conquering, this bill has backfired and united communities across the motu [country] in solidarity for our founding agreement and what it represents,\" Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson later said in a statement.",
      "The second reading came after a select committee, which had been looking into the proposed legislation released its final report - revealing that more than 300,000 submissions had been made on it, the vast majority of which were opposed.",
      "It is the largest response to proposed legislation that the New Zealand parliament has ever received.",
      "While the principles of the Treaty have never been defined in law, its core values have, over time, been woven into different pieces of legislation in an effort to offer redress to M\u0101ori for the wrong done to them during colonisation.",
      "Act's proposed legislation had three main principles: that the New Zealand government has the power to govern, and parliament to make laws; that the Crown would respect the rights of M\u0101ori at the time the Treaty was signed; and that everyone is equal before the law and entitled to equal protection.",
      "The party said the bill would not alter the Treaty itself but would \"continue the process of defining the Treaty principles\". This, they believe, would help to create equality for all New Zealanders and improve social cohesion.",
      "Among those backing it was Ruth Richardson, a former finance minister for the centre-right National Party, who told the select committee that the proposed legislation was \"a bill of consequence whose time has come\".",
      "She argued that while the Treaty itself could not be disputed, the idea of its principles was a \"relatively modern matter\", and that these principles had so far been largely defined by the courts, rather than parliament.",
      "\"There is a new imperative in New Zealand on the cultural front, the necessity to address and correct Treaty overreach that has increasingly and evidently become wayward and wrong,\" she said.",
      "Opponents of the bill, meanwhile, believe it would be detrimental to M\u0101ori and create greater social divides.",
      "Sharon Hawke, the daughter of the late M\u0101ori activist and MP Joe Hawke, spoke to the select committee on behalf of the Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua \u014cr\u0101kei hap\u016b [sub-tribe] - telling it that the legislation \"strips the fabric of where we've been heading for in the last three decades at improving our people's [M\u0101ori's] ability to gain education, gain warm housing, gain good health\".",
      "She added that the bill \"polluted\" the idea of all New Zealanders having a future together.",
      "\"We will continue to show our opposition to this,\" she said.",
      "Key issues identified by members of the public who made submissions to the select committee included that it was inconsistent with the values of the Treaty, and that it had promoted equality with equity - not taking into account social disparities, such as those created by the legacy of colonisation.",
      "There were also concerns about the extent to which the bill complied with international law, and whether it would negatively impact New Zealand's reputation internationally.",
      "Submitters who supported the bill, meanwhile, referred to a current lack of clarity and certainty about the principles of the Treaty, and of the importance of equality for all.",
      "They also said that it was important to hold a referendum to facilitate a national conversation around the Treaty - something David Seymour believes is still needed.",
      "The Treaty Principles Bill passed its first reading in November, with support from National - the dominant party in New Zealand's ruling coalition - who had promised to back it as part of a coalition agreement with Act, but not any further.",
      "Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who is also leader of the National Party, previously said there was nothing in the bill that he liked. He was not in parliament for its second reading, but remarked earlier in the day that it was time to move on from it.",

      "Church services, packed with fans decked in the Gunners' red and white colours, have been held before big matches - with prayers offered up for a side that sometimes looks as though it needs divine assistance.",
      "The passion for Arsenal and other English clubs has spawned an entire industry in Uganda, with shops and vendors selling jerseys and bigger companies targeting their advertising around the results, while for sports betting companies it is massive business.",
      "\"I have covered football across Africa for many years and I can tell you without a doubt that the soccer enthusiasm in Uganda is on another level,\" veteran sports journalist Isaac Mumema told the BBC.",

      "Ugandan fan clubs have been set up for all the top English sides. WhatsApp groups keep the debates going beyond halls and bars.",
      "But Arsenal fans seem to take it to another level - some have even been arrested for holding victory parades without police notice after winning big matches.",

      "'We need something special' - can Real turn tie around?",
      "\"Our people naturally get attached to something wholeheartedly and Ugandans really love football,\" Uganda Football Coaches Association (UFCA) chairman Stone Kyambadde told the BBC.",
      "\"This soccer fanaticism has even grown stronger with the young generation because they watch the English Premier League from anywhere,\" he said.",
      "They can keep abreast of scores on their phones, but it is mainly a communal event and even the most remote village will have a makeshift video hall where fans will pack in to watch matches.",
      "But it was for a funeral that villagers near Lake Victoria gathered last December, to bury a 30-year-old carpenter who was shot dead while celebrating Arsenal's victory over Manchester United.",
      "Speaker after speaker lamented the loss of John Senyange, who had been a Gunner all his life.",
      "He had been watching the match in a video hall in the town of Lukaya - and when spontaneous cheering erupted from Arsenal fans after the final whistle, it upset their rivals, including a security guard, who reportedly pulled the trigger.",

      "In 2023, there were four Premiership-related deaths in different parts of the country - two Arsenal fans were killed by Man Utd supporters, a fan died in mysterious circumstances after Man Utd were trounced 7-0 by Liverpool and another man died from stab wounds after trying to intervene in a fight after Arsenal lost to Man Utd.",
      "Football violence in Uganda dates back to the 1980s when local games were characterised by stone-throwing and fistfights between rival fans.",
      "\"There has always been cases of violence whenever Express FC and SC Villa - the two main local teams in Uganda - have a major derby,\" sports scientist Lumbuye Linika told me at a football pitch in Kampala.",
      "But things have become much worse - a situation experts blame on fanaticism fuelled by gambling, with many men trying to earn their living by placing bets.",
      "In a tragic case several years ago, police said a man killed himself with poison after losing money in a bet.",
      "With the rise of online gambling, it just takes a second to place a bet via an app on your phone which brings the hope of winning big coupled with bragging rights.",
      "Gaming companies have also taken advantage of the Ugandan obsession with the EPL, setting up viewing centres where fans can watch games and place their bets.",

      "\"With limited job opportunities, many football fans are turning to betting as a way to earn quick money,\" said Amos Kalwegira, who stopped to chat to me one Monday morning on a street in Kampala when I spotted him in a Man Utd shirt.",
      "\"This has become an intense emotional investment which often quickly turns into aggression when soccer results aren't favourable.\"",
      "For Mr Linika this is all proving corrosive: \"Football should make us happy and Western soccer is supposed to be a form of entertainment but here in Uganda we have turned it to be a way of earning a livelihood, spoiling the fun.\"",
      "But Collins Bongomin, a senior officer in one of Uganda's betting companies, said the industry should not be blamed for football violence.",
      "\"People just lack sufficient knowledge on managing expectations and anger,\" he told the BBC, noting industry efforts to encourage responsible gambling.",
      "With more than 2,000 betting shops across the country, it is also proving lucrative for the government, which collected about $50m (\u00a340m) in tax revenue from gambling last year, according to local media.",
      "Some note that the lethal rivalry mainly involves Uganda's Arsenal and Man Utd fans, suggesting this has something to do with age and background.",
      "Mr Linika, a Liverpool supporter, said his team tended to attract an older crowd and those that were slightly better off - with Arsenal's and Man Utd's fanbase drawn from poorer areas.",
      "\"Currently we are on top of the Premier League table and you rarely hear about a Liverpool fan involved in violence,\" he said.",

      "But Arsenal fan Agnes Katende laughed this off when I met up with them both in Kampala - the two women are part of a dedicated female following of the EPL. Ms Icumar is even part of a female only fan club.",
      "For Solomon Kutesa, secretary of the official Arsenal Supporters Club in Uganda, the country's drinking culture is to blame for the football violence.",
      "\"Some of the fans watch the games while intoxicated and it becomes hard to manage them when their teams lose,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Some suggest getting fans back into local stadiums and out of bars could curb the hysteria - and help revitalise the Ugandan Premier League.",

      "Former footballer Tom Lwanga, who played for Uganda's national team when the Cranes reached the finals of the 1978 Africa Cup of Nations, agreed.",

      "It has taken off online, with brands and influencers dabbling in creating their mini-me.",

      "These instructions are really important.",
      "They tell the AI tool everything it is meant to generate, from the items a person wants to appear with to the kind of packaging they should be in - which includes mimicking the box and font of popular toys like Barbie.",
      "Many online will then personalise it further with their name, job and clothing choices.",
      "Though it does not always work, and many have also shared some of the amusing mistakes the tools made, where the action dolls look nothing like them.",
      "Like other generative AI tools, image generators are also prone to making things up, and may make assumptions about how someone should look.",

    "summary": "Amid a trade war with the US, our China correspondent explains why Beijing doesn't need to change tactics.",
    "story": [
      "In response to why Beijing is not backing down to Donald Trump on tariffs, the answer is that it doesn't have to.",
      "China's leaders would say that they are not inclined to cave in to a bully \u2013 something its government has repeatedly labelled the Trump administration as \u2013 but it also has a capacity to do this way beyond any other country on Earth.",
      "Before the tariff war kicked in, China did have a massive volume of sales to the US but, to put it into context, this only amounted to 2% of its GDP.",
      "That said, the Communist Party would clearly prefer not to be locked in a trade war with the US at a time when it has been struggling to fix its own considerable economic headaches, after years of a real estate crisis, overblown regional debt and persistent youth unemployment.",
      "However, despite this, the government has told its people that it is in a strong position to resist the attacks from the US.",
      "It also knows its own tariffs are clearly going to hurt US exporters as well.",
      "Trump has been bragging to his supporters that it would be easy to force China into submission by simply hitting the country with tariffs, but this has proven to be misleading in the extreme.",
      "Beijing is not going to surrender.",
      "China's leader Xi Jinping told the visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday that his country and the European Union should \"jointly resist the unilateral bullying practices\" of the Trump administration.",
      "Sanchez, in turn, said that China's trade tensions with the US should not impede its cooperation with Europe.",
      "Their meeting took place in the Chinese capital in the hours before Beijing again increased its tariffs on goods from the US - though it has said it will not respond to further US tariff increases.",
      "Next week Xi will visit Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia. These are all countries which have been hit hard by Trump's tariffs.",
      "His ministers have been meeting counterparts from South Africa, Saudi Arabia and India, talking up greater trade co-operation.",
      "In addition, China and the EU are reportedly in talks about potentially removing European tariffs on Chinese cars, to be replaced by a minimum price instead, to rein in a new round of dumping.",
      "In short, wherever you look, you can see that China has options.",
      "And analysts have said that these mutual tariff increases by the two superpowers are now becoming almost meaningless, as they've already passed the point of cutting out much of the trade between them.",
      "So, the tit-for-tat tariff increases in both directions have become more like symbolism.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning has, over the past two days, posted images of Chairman Mao on social media, including a clip during the Korean War when he told the US that \"no matter how long this war lasts we will never yield\".",
      "Above this, she posted her own comments, saying: \"We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We won't back down.\"",

    "story": [
      "While on holiday in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) last week, there was only one mission on my mind - getting my hands on the viral \"Dubai chocolate\" bar.",
      "If you're on TikTok, you will have seen the bar, which combines the flavours of chocolate, pistachio and tahini with filo pastry, and is inspired by the Arab dessert Knafeh.",
      "The original, called Can't Get Knafeh of It, by FIX Chocolatier, has been sold exclusively in the UAE since 2022. It become so popular on social media that it's only on sale for two hours a day and often sells out within minutes.",
      "But now imitations, known by the nickname \"Dubai chocolate\", have hit UK supermarkets including Waitrose, Lidl and Morrisons, with some supermarkets limiting the number of bars customers are allowed to buy.",
      "Yezen Alani, who co-owns FIX with his wife Sarah Hamouda, told the BBC the global attention Dubai chocolate was getting was \"flattering and humbling\".",
      "The FIX chocolate bar was first imagined by Hamouda in 2021, who craved the flavours while she was pregnant.",
      "Alani and Hamouda started developing the bar a year later, running the business alongside their corporate jobs.",
      "\"Sarah and I were brought up in the UK and we moved to Dubai 10 years ago, so we've got Western and Arab roots.",
      "\"We wanted to create flavours that were inspired by that,\" Alani says.",
      "Part of the appeal of the chocolate is its exclusivity - you can only order it using a food delivery app, rather than walking into a shop or grabbing it at the supermarket.",
      "It costs around \u00a315 per bar and can only be bought during specific hours of the day to ensure the company can fulfil all their orders.",
      "I also saw similar bars sold in many shops in the region, dubbed \"Dubai chocolate\" and adorned with pictures of pistachios and filo pastry.",
      "Alani says the \"copycat\" bars are \"very frustrating because people are trying knockoffs, which damages our brand\".",
      "One of the reasons for the bar's surge in popularity has been social media - with a viral video by TikTok user Maria Vehera  from 2023 being cited as one of the main reasons for its rise to prominence.",
      "It shows Vehera trying the Knafeh bar for the first time - along with several others made by the same chocolatier - and has been liked nearly seven million times.",
      "The way the bar looks is made for social media -  from the attractive orange and green spots on top of the smooth milk chocolate to the crunch sound it makes when you break off a piece.",
      "Chocolate combined with pistachio isn't new but the real standout element is the crunchy nature of the filling, with the filo pastry adding a texture and thickness to the bar.",
      "Since the Can't Get Knafeh of It bar is only available in one country, other brands have started to sell their versions in the UK, including Swiss chocolate manufacturer Lindt whose Dubai chocolate is being sold for \u00a310 in supermarkets.",
      "Since stocking the bar, Waitrose says they've had to introduce a two-bar limit for customers in order to regulate stock levels.",
      "Another version has also been sold by Home Bargains, while supermarket Lidl has its own version for \u00a34.99 and is also limiting purchase numbers.",
      "One influencer documented how the bar been kept behind tills for this reason.",
      "Having tried the Lindt bar and a couple of other versions being sold in corner shops, there is quite a contrast.",
      "The FIX chocolate is billed as a \"dessert bar\" and needs to be kept in the fridge, with a short expiry date like many dairy items.",
      "This isn't the case for the others, which have been designed to have a longer shelf life.",
      "You can also see the difference in taste and texture - the original bar is almost double the width of the Lindt bar, which is more aligned to the size and shape of a standard chocolate bar.",
      "When Alani and Hamouda first started out, they employed one person to fulfil around six to seven orders a day.",
      "But since growing in popularity, primarily thanks to TikTok, their business now employs 20 people, who fulfil 500 orders a day.",
      "One big talking point has been the price of the product, which is \u00a315 per bar.",
      "\"It's all handmade, every single design is done by hand,\" Alani says.",
      "\"We use premium ingredients and the process is not like making a Cadbury's bar - you've got the baking, moulding the chocolate to the design and with the filling itself, even the pistachios are hand-picked and processed\".",
      "Speaking to Arabian Business last year, Hamouda said: \"My mother used to make Knafeh, and that's something I wanted to capture my own way.",
      "\"Knafeh was the first flavour we perfected. The crunch, the pistachio, it had to be just right,\" she added.",
      "Despite the product's success, Alani says \"it's been a tough journey\" as the pair have been working together full time while also raising their two children.",
      "\"There's been times where we've wanted to give up, but we said to ourselves 'we'll keep going as long as we can pay the rent' and now we have no regrets as its worked out\"."

    "summary": "Australia's housing crisis has hit its worst point in decades, becoming a key issue in the upcoming election.",
    "story": [
      "Buying or renting a home has become unaffordable for the average Australian, driven by a perfect storm of astronomical house prices, relentless rental increases and a lack of social housing.",
      "With less than a month until the federal election, housing remains among the top issues for voters, and the country's two major parties \u2013 the Labor Party and the Liberal-National Coalition - have both pledged to tackle the crisis in a range of ways.",
      "Australians are already struggling under cost-of-living pressures and bracing for the effects of Donald Trump's global tariff war. And it remains to be seen whether either party will sway voters with their promise of restoring the Australian dream.",
      "Why are house prices in Australia so high?",
      "Simply put, Australia has not been building enough homes to meet the demands of its rapidly growing population, creating a scarcity that makes any available home more expensive to buy or rent.",
      "Compounding the issue are Australia's restrictive planning laws, which prevent homes being built where most people want to live, such as in major cities.",
      "Red tape means that popular metropolitan areas like Melbourne and Sydney are far less dense than comparably sized cities around the world.",
      "The steady decline of public housing and ballooning waitlists have made matters worse, tipping people into homelessness or overcrowded living conditions.",
      "Climate change has also made many areas increasingly unliveable, with natural disasters such as bushfires and severe storms destroying large swathes of properties.",
      "Meanwhile, decades of government policies have commercialised property ownership. So the ideal of owning a home, once seen as a right in Australia, has turned into an investment opportunity.",
      "How much do I need to buy or rent a home in Australia?",
      "In short: it depends where you live.",
      "Sydney is currently the second least affordable city in the world to buy a property, according to a 2023 Demographia International Housing Affordability survey.",
      "The latest data from property analytics company CoreLogic shows the average Sydney home costs almost A$1.2m (\u00a3570,294, $742,026).",
      "Across the nation's capital cities, the combined average house price sits at just over A$900,000.",
      "House prices in Australia overall have also jumped 39.1% in the last five years - and wages have failed to keep up.",
      "It now takes the average prospective homeowner around 10 years to save the 20% deposit usually required to buy an average home, according to a 2024 State of the Housing System report.",
      "The rental market has provided little relief, with rents increasing by 36.1% nationally since the onset of Covid - an equivalent rise of A$171 per week.",
      "Sydney topped the charts with a median weekly rent of A$773, according to CoreLogic's latest rental review. Perth came in second with average rents at A$695 per week, followed by Canberra at A$667 per week.",
      "Are immigration and foreign buyers causing housing strain?",
      "Immigration and foreign property purchases are often cited as causes for Australia's housing crisis. But experts say that they are not significant contributors  statistically.",
      "Many people who move to Australia are temporary migrants, such as international students who live in dedicated student accommodation rather than entering the housing market, according to Michael Fotheringham, head of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute.",
      "\"The impact [of migrants] on the housing market is not as profound as some commentators have suggested,\" Mr Fotheringham tells the BBC.",
      "Foreign purchases of homes, meanwhile, is \"a very small issue\" with not much meaningful impact on housing strain, says Brendan Coates, from the Grattan Institute public policy think tank.",
      "The year the Australian Dream died",
      "How Australia is becoming more unliveable",
      "The latest data released by the Australian Taxation Office supports this, with homes purchased by foreign buyers in 2022-23 representing less than one percent of all sales.",
      "\"It's already very difficult for foreigners to purchase homes under existing foreign investment rules. They are subject to a wide range of taxes, particularly in some states,\" Mr Coates explains.",
      "What have Australia's major parties promised?",
      "Labor and the Coalition have both promised to invest in building more homes \u2013 with Labor offering 1.2 million by 2029, and the Coalition vowing to unlock 500,000.",
      "Labor announced a A$33bn housing investment plan in their latest budget, which pledges to help first-time homebuyers purchase properties with smaller deposits through shared-equity loans.",
      "They have also promised to create more social housing and subsidies to help low-to-moderate-income earners own and rent more affordably.",
      "Central to the Coalition's housing affordability policy is cutting migration, reducing the number of international students and implementing a two-year ban on foreign investment in existing properties.",
      "Additionally, they have promised a A$5bn boost to infrastructure to support local councils by paying for water, power and sewerage at housing development sites.",
      "The Greens' policies, meanwhile, have focused on alleviating pressures on renters by calling for national rent freezes and caps.",
      "They have also said that in the event of a minority government, they will be pushing to reform tax incentives for investors.",
      "What are the experts saying about each party's policies?",
      "In short, experts say that while both Labor and the Coalition's policies are steps in the right direction, neither are sufficient to solve the housing problem.",
      "\"A combination of both parties' platforms would be better than what we're seeing from either side individually,\" Mr Coates tells the BBC.",
      "A 2025 State of the Land report by the Urban Development Institute of Australia says the federal government will fail to meet its target of 1.2 million new homes by 2029 \u2013 falling short by almost 400,000.",
      "The Coalition's focus on reducing immigration, meanwhile, will only make housing marginally cheaper while making Australia poorer in the long-term, according to Mr Coates.",
      "The cuts to migration will mean fewer skilled migrants, he explains, and the loss of revenue from those migrants will result in higher taxes for Australians.",

    "summary": "When F. Scott Fitzgerald\u200b wrote \"The Great Gatsby\"\u200b at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",

      "When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote \"The Great Gatsby\" at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",
      "In fact, when Fitzgerald \u2013 a St. Paul, Minnesota native whose debut novel \"This Side of Paradise\" launched him into national prominence at the age of 24 \u2013 died in 1940 at the early age of 44, the book was already in danger of falling into obscurity.",
      "Now, 100 years after the book's first publication on April 10, 1925, it endures as one of the country's foremost tales of American hubris, modern yearning and class consciousness. And its clear-eyed assessment of the attainability of the American dream remains incisive with each passing decade.",
      "Fitzgerald's book, long a staple in high school literature classes, tells the story of Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner (and veiled Fitzgerald stand-in) who becomes enamored with the bon vivant, Jazz Age lifestyle on Long Island, specifically the effects of mutli-millioniare Jay Gatsby.",
      "Like Carraway, Gatsby is a Midwesterner who has trekked to the East Coast to make a name for himself. It's Carraway's cousin Daisy Buchanan who serves as the catalyst for Gatsby's downfall, and ultimately Carraway's own disillusionment. All the while, a symbolic green light beckons from the distance.",
      "When the book was first published, reviews were largely positive, though not unanimous. Fitzgerald, who originally wanted to title the book \"Trimalchio in West Egg\" before being persuaded to go with a title he thought far more generic, watched as the book languished on the vine commercially, selling fewer than 25,000 copies in the initial push.",
      "He would only complete one further novel in his lifetime: 1934's \"Tender is the Night,\" a thinly-veiled roman \u00e0 clef of Fitzgerald's own marriage to socialite Zelda Sayre, detailing their mutual descent into alcoholism and mental illness. Fitzgerald's early death from a heart attack was likely fuelled by years and years of alcohol abuse. Ironically, he'd gone sober just ahead of the cardiac event.",
      "If \"The Great Gatsby\" never achieved the level of esteem it now enjoys during the author's own life, it wasn't long after his death that Fitgerald's literary reputation took off.",
      "When the Modern Library asked authors, historians, critics and publishers on the eve of Y2K to rank their picks for the world's best novels of the 20th century, it was \"The Great Gatsby\" that\u00a0stood above all other U.S. contenders near the top of the poll. (The novel landed in second place, bookended by Irish author James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the top three.)",
      "The novel has since launched multiple film adaptations, has been transposed to the stage, and since going into the public domain in 2021, has been the subject of an endless array of reimaginings, remixes and mashups. It's even cleared space around itself as a modern-day meme, in the form of an animated .GIF depicting Leonardo Dicaprio (playing Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation) smirking as he offers a champagne toast flanked by ostentatious fireworks.",
      "Host of \"Gatsby\" centennial events planned in New York, Minnesota",
      "A host of \"Gatsby\"-themed events are planned to mark the novel's centennial anniversary. In New York, the Empire State Building announced plans to light up in green in a nod to the novel's symbolic green light at the end of Tom and Daisy's dock.",
      "There was also a rowdy \"Roaring Twenties\" party at the Empire Steak House in New York, which was an opulent opera house in Fitzgerald's era. Billed as the \"nation's most extravagant celebration,\" the event featured live jazz, period dancing, and speeches from officials with the New York Public Library.",
      "In honor of the legendary stage play, Broadway has marked the occasion with a release of new block tickets for the show. Tickets are on sale now and will run through Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "The iconic Victorian-themed New York bar, Oscar Wilde, is also hosting a Gatsby-inspired soir\u00e9e on Saturday. The event information markets the celebration as \"an all-day affair of music, opulence and mischief.\" Events kick off at 2 p.m. and continue into the evening until 11 p.m.",
      "Additionally, multiple restaurants are offering exclusive discounts on cocktails, and even a free drink at some places. Gatsby's Landing, Nothing Really Matters, Angelina Bakery and The Plaza are all listed as participants. All events and discounts are ongoing throughout the month of April.",
      "In Fitzgerald's hometown of St. Paul, the events include a new exhibit of the author's life and times at the Minnesota History Center, as well as various, less-than-sober events leaning into the novel's party-friendly Prohibition-era setting.",
      "If you managed to get through high school without having been assigned to read the book, there are a number of live readings of the book scheduled this month, including at St. Paul's Gale Family Library.",

      "\"The first thing my dad said is, 'This is an accurate portrayal of what it was to love and fear this woman.' Once I knew that I had gotten her right, everything else flowed,\" she said during an appearance on \"CBS Mornings\" on Wednesday.",
      "The book details Hanks' six-month journey along Interstate 10 from California to Florida, during which she sought to better understand Susan Dillingham \u2014 who died in 2002 \u2014 and reflect on her own difficult childhood.",
      "\"I'm just another girl trying to make sense of her dead, crazy mother,\" Hanks said.",
      "Hanks revealed that while growing up, she had language to understand addiction \u2014 her mother hosted 12-step programs in their home \u2014 but lacked vocabulary for mental illness.",
      "\"My mom \u2014 I had language for addiction because we used to host 12-step programs in our house, and my mom would have sponsees stay with us. I had a language even from 8 years old about addiction, but there was no language for mental health and what was sort of wrong in the house,\" Hanks explained. \"A lot of the book is me trying to create that language and share it.\"",
      "The author described her mother's \"fluid\" relationship with reality, saying in the book that \"mom's relationship with reality was fluid. Truth was fed through the meat grinder of mental illness.\"",
      "She detailed both emotional and physical abuse in her childhood home. Hanks explained that in California during the late 1980s, family law typically required evidence of physical abuse before a child could be removed from a situation.",
      "\"Family law in California in the late '80s wasn't enough room for it. At that time, you kind of had to have the receipts of physical abuse to get pulled out of a situation. And once we crossed that rubicon is when I moved to Los Angeles,\" she said.",
      "What Hanks learned about her mother",
      "Despite the difficult relationship, Hanks said she remained protective of her mother. In writing the memoir, she incorporated her mother's poetry as a way to reconnect with her.",
      "\"At the time, my mom kind of had this stance like a thoroughbred who had been put out to pasture too soon, and she didn't get her chance as an artist because of my dad's, as I describe it, catastrophic fame,\" Hanks said. \"I think including her poetry in the book is a way of treating her seriously as an artist and getting back into conversation with her. And anybody who's buried a parent knows that a two-way conversation suddenly becomes a one-way conversation.\"",
      "When asked about the truth she now understands, Hanks reflected, \"The truth is, my mother had good days and bad days. And I was lucky to experience the good days, and I was shaped by the bad days. All of the care and protection I had for the child that I was doesn't diminish what happened between us. But it means that as I get older, there's more wiggle room and acceptance for her flaws and mine.\"",
      "The memoir also explores themes of place and identity. As a journalist accustomed to interviewing others, Hanks discovered, \"When you're talking to stone-cold strangers, you can't start with, 'Tell me about your mom,' but you can start with, 'Tell me where you're from.' If someone wants to talk about their hometown, it's an elevator to their deepest self.\"",

      "I had come from a world of higher-end restaurants, of finesse and creativity. So a tapas restaurant was not exactly what I was looking for. But my new partners in Washington, DC, had a clear idea: they wanted to open a Spanish restaurant that was fun. They called it Jaleo, which means \"merrymaking, a joyful celebration,\" inspired by the John Singer Sargent painting of a Spanish woman dancing to guitars. It lives in Boston, but it had traveled on loan to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and they had seen it there. They even painted a reproduction of it on a wall of the new restaurant.",
      "I understood that sense of joy. I'm the kind of guy who doesn't like tables. I prefer standing up at bars. If I can, I like to hop around to five different bars and eat good food at each one. Jaleo was a chance to show how I like to enjoy life. These little plates of tapas were also a chance to give people more access to different bites of Spanish food, different tastes of the various regions of Spain. Maybe people didn't know what they wanted to eat, and the small plates would be a way to move a little bit further out of their comfort zones. Of course, it was an opportunity to make a mark for myself. And I could do that while being a kind of ambassador for my country, in the capital of the United States, not too far from the White House and the US Capitol. It felt like an extension of my military service, going from port to port on a historic tall-mast ship, showing the best of Spain to the world.",
      "I knew there were immigrants before me who had brought Spanish food to every corner of America. They opened restaurants, maybe some of them played guitar or danced flamenco. They were mythical places. Tio Pepe in Baltimore. Caf\u00e9 San Martin in New York. Montse Guill\u00e9n's El Internacional in Tribeca, which was short-lived but put Spanish food and drink on the map. There was already a high-end Spanish restaurant in Washington called Taberna del Alabardero, and the more informal Churreria Madrid in Adams Morgan.",
      "Washington at that time was not seen as a culinary mecca, even by the people of DC, and Jaleo opened in a downtown neighborhood, known as Penn Quarter, that was empty at night. But it would not stay that way. It would become a very important part of the city, not too far away from where all the big decisions were made that affected the country and the world. It was a part of the city where senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and business executives would gather. It was the home of new businesses like America Online, and so many other amazing new companies. Slowly but surely, Jaleo became a huge success.",
      "That's not to say it was easy. I was young, just twenty-three years old, and I was still learning how to run a kitchen. The movie in my head cast me as the creative guy, but now I needed to learn how to run the place. Fortunately, I had a wonderful, patient teacher: Ann Cashion, who was the first executive chef of Jaleo, showed me how to do the job properly, even though I preferred the creative side of things.",
      "We didn't really know whether American diners would accept these little plates, or the idea of sharing plates at all. What happened if people didn't want to share? Our waiters were concerned and would often tell me how some people said they weren't comfortable with sharing. I had a simple answer. If they didn't want to share, they could move the plate ten inches closer to them and use their knife and fork to protect the dish for themselves. I wasn't going to Americanize tapas for them. It's what we did in the south of Spain and in Catalonia. They would adapt because it was a fun way to be with friends. Who doesn't want to dig a fork into the plate of the person across the table?",
      "My heart was full of the joy that comes from introducing Spanish food to new people. That joy translated into happy guests eating the dishes I knew. Jaleo was a place where I could share what I knew about Spanish food: croquetas, gazpacho, gambas al ajillo, sangria. But it was also a way to learn more about what I didn't know about Spanish food. I had not traveled all across Spain at the age of twenty-three, nor did I know about all of Spanish gastronomy. Far from it. The reality is that you need to keep learning in any line of work. People say I'm one of the biggest experts in Spanish cooking, but I still feel clueless sometimes. Every time I go back to Spain and discover a new ingredient or a new dish, it feels to me the same as looking at the stars. You can see a few, but how many more are out there that you cannot see? You can read books, and you can travel, but learning is a lifetime of curiosity and discovery.",
      "Sometimes that work can feel less joyful and more of struggle. In particular, in those early days, it was a struggle to buy the right ingredients. Believe it or not, I'm a pragmatic guy. You can support the local economy, buying local fruit and vegetables for instance. But there are some ingredients that cannot be replaced. I observed the success of Italy, where they have been amazingly successful in supporting the small towns where their unique food products are made. I believed we could do the same for the small towns and food producers of Spain. Manchego cheese is like no other. Sweet roasted piquillo peppers are unique. Our olive oil is the envy of Europe, and even gets repackaged under Italian names. Our sherry vinegar is unmatched. And nothing compares to our pure-bred Ib\u00e9rico ham, the very best ham in the world. You can't have Spanish cooking without some of the staples. It was a symbiotic relationship.",
      "Still, importing food is not always easy. There are regulations and policies, rules to protect consumers and businesses. The US Department of Agriculture insists that slaughterhouses operate according to American standards, not European ones, if they want to sell their meat in the United States. They need to be inspected, even though Europeans have been eating these foods for centuries without any problems. It was crazy but also fascinating. Of course, it wasn't just a question of safety; there were concerns that ham from Spain would hurt ham in America. So one day I met a bearded man visiting Washington, and he happened to be a great Ib\u00e9rico ham producer who was investing to comply with US regulations at his slaughterhouse: Santiago Mart\u00edn, the owner of Embutidos Ferm\u00edn. I helped producers like Santiago navigate these challenges with Congress and the administration, finding a lawyer who assisted the Italians in bringing Parma ham to America. Because in reality these European hams were much more expensive than the American hams, and they helped elevate the perception of all pork products in America. It was a win-win for America and Spain.",
      "That's the world of work. Your commitment to your values, to what's important, can turn a seemingly small decision\u2014like buying a type of roasted pepper or a slice of ham\u2014into something as big as international relations.",
      "Your sense of responsibility is what matters. How was I going to be a Spanish chef without all these ingredients? I had to do the work, just like other chefs and importers who made Spanish food available in the United States. People like Tim Harris, who created the incredible Spanish food store La Tienda, and Juana Gimeno Faraone, who started La Espa\u00f1ola Meats. Or Almudena de Llaguno and Steve Metzler bringing Spanish wines to America; and Jorge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, who would walk the streets of Manhattan with a big bag filled with wine bottles, trying to get his wines into a few restaurants. The whole ecosystem of Spanish food people kept me going, and I needed to play my part, too.",
      "So Jaleo became much more than a restaurant; it was a way to build bridges between these two countries, to inspire American chefs to buy and cook with Spanish ingredients, to spread the culture that made me who I am. Something like 80 percent of all restaurants close before they reach their five-year anniversary. Jaleo has now been open for thirty years, and we have new Jaleos in Orlando, Las Vegas, and even Dubai. Because we committed from the first year to what we value\u2014to what matters\u2014even when we didn't yet have all the expertise to make it happen.",
      "I feel a sense of joy when I see Ib\u00e9rico ham, or Spanish anchovies, or wines from the Bierzo region in restaurants and shops. I know that nothing would have happened without the persistence and vision of so many people who may now be forgotten. They built the bridges that will last forever\u2014because they cared so deeply.",
      "Follow what you feel is your purpose\u2014not what others tell you to do. Otherwise you lose your soul and become a commodity. Don't be a commodity. Be true to yourself.",

    "summary": "Consumers fraudulently enrolled in Affordable Care Act coverage could receive unexpected tax bills \u2014 possibly their only clue they've been victimized.",
    "story": [
      "Because of past fraud by rogue brokers, some Affordable Care Act policyholders may get an unexpected tax bill this season.",
      "But that isn't the only potential shock. Other changes coming soon - stemming from proposals by the administration of President Donald Trump - could affect their coverage and its cost. And sorting out related problems and challenges may take longer as federal workers are laid off and funding for assistance programs is cut.",
      "First up: taxes",
      "Tax season is when some consumers learn they were fraudulently enrolled in an ACA plan or switched to a different one without their knowledge.",
      "Those unauthorized enrollments or changes took off in late 2023 and continued through last year, drawing more than 274,000 complaints in the first eight months of 2024 to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, mostly about rogue agents or call centers.",
      "Tax problems can arise if those enrollments resulted in premium tax credits exceeding the amount the consumer should have received. In those cases, consumers may have to pay all or part of those credits back. The amount owed could range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, with some caps based on income.",
      "The first clue some people have is when they get a 1095-A form in the mail.",
      "Those documents are sent out by the state and federal marketplaces to the IRS and ACA enrollees, showing any tax credit payments made to health insurers on a taxpayer's behalf. Taxpayers use the premium tax credit information from the 1095-A when completing their return.",
      "Returns can be held up if the IRS has information indicating the taxpayer has ACA coverage that they failed to report on their return, or if there are other discrepancies.",
      "The Biden administration last year took steps to slow the fraudulent switching, including requiring a three-way call between the broker, client, and marketplace for some enrollment issues.",
      "\"While we may be seeing less [fraud], we're still dealing with 2024 taxes,\" said Erin Kinard, director of systems and intake for the Health and Economic Opportunity Program at Pisgah Legal Services, a nonprofit serving western North Carolina that offers both legal help and assistance with ACA problems.",
      "Consumers who suspect they were fraudulently enrolled should immediately call their federal or state ACA marketplace, experts say. Some consumers will be referred to special federal caseworkers throught he marketplaces. But some of those caseworkers are now part of the broad reduction in force by theTrump administration.",
      "In recent days, \"they laid off two divisions on the Affordable Care Act side,\" said Jeffrey Grant, who oversaw ACA issues as CMS' deputy director for operations in the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight before leaving in February.",
      "With fewer caseworkers, \"it will take longer to get problems taken care of,\" said Grant, who is now president of Schedule F Healthcare Strategies, a consulting group that aims to help laid-off federal workers find new jobs. \"The marketplace is twice as big as it was the last time the Trump administration was here, and now they are cutting caseworkers to less than were around then.\"",

      "And these cases are difficult because the rogue brokers who enrolled consumers sometimes misstated their income so they would qualify for the largest tax credits possible. Other consumers have found they were enrolled even though they had affordable employer coverage, making them ineligible for ACA subsidies.",
      "That's what happened to Anthony Akra and his wife, Ashley Zukoski, in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were enrolled in a plan without their knowledge in 2023, by a broker in Florida with whom they had never spoken. The couple had health insurance through Zukoski's employer. The broker listed an income that qualified the household for a large subsidy that fully offset the monthly premium cost, so the couple never received a bill. One day, a 1095-A form showed up in their mailbox.",
      "\"I didn't know what the hell it was,\" said Akra, who said the form showed that he had been receiving hundreds of dollars a month in premium tax credits.",
      "He would owe a big chunk of that back unless he could get the plan retroactively canceled. Because their pharmacy, part of a national chain, had switched them to the new plan, also without telling them, they had used the new coverage every time they filled a prescription. That inadvertent use of the policy complicated their efforts to get the fraudulent coverage revoked.",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS withheld more than $4,000 from their tax refund based on the information sent through that 1095-A form.\u00a0 Months passed, but with assistance from a \"navigator\" program \u2014 a government-fundednonprofit that helps people deal with insurance problems \u2014 they were able to get the incorrectinsurance canceled and a refund at the end of October.",
      "It is not unusual for people to spend weeks or even months trying to sort out the mess, said Kinard, whose organization is similar to the one that helped Akra.",
      "While navigator programs nationwide are still operating to help people sign up for health coverage or address issues, the Trump administration has targeted their funding for a 90% cut. Meanwhile, ACA enrollees may face a range of other surprises due to policy and budget steps proposed by the Trump administration.",
      "More Potential Changes",
      "Congress must decide whether to extend premium tax credits that were enhanced during the covid pandemic, which expanded eligibility for the credits and made them larger for many enrollees. Keeping them in place would be expensive, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation estimating it would add $335 billion to the deficit through 2034.",
      "That debate will come amid another deficit-affecting decision: whether to extend tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration, which would add trillions to the budget deficit through 2034.",
      "If the enhanced subsidies are not renewed, monthly premium costs would rise by an average of over 75%, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Premiums could more than double in some states, including many GOP-led ones, such as Texas, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, and West Virginia.",
      "That could spark a political backlash. Additionally, the enhanced subsidies are seen as a main reason for strong enrollment growth, leading to more than 24 million people signing up for ACA plans for this year.",
      "A recent KFF study found the 15 states with the most enrollment growth since 2020 were all won by Trump in 2024.",
      "A proposed rule released last month by the Trump administration includes provisions to shorten the annual enrollment period, get rid of a special open enrollment period that allows low-income people to sign up year-round, and require stricter verification of income and other information when people apply for coverage. The administration says most of these steps are needed to reduce fraud in the system.",
      "The administration estimates that 750,000 to 2 million fewer people would enroll in coverage as a result of the changes.",
      "The new rule, if finalized, will make it harder for people to enroll, said Xonjenese Jacobs, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. Losing the year-round enrollment for very low-income people, for example, would affect people short on cash who move often to stay with relatives or friends, and those who have unsteady employment, making it hard to know when or where to enroll and what their income might be in the coming year.",
      "\"They don't have the same ability to plan,\" Jacobs said. \"It's definitely going to make a difference for a lot of the individuals that we service.\""

      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. first said Sunday that the CDC would be redeploying to Texas at its governor's request, after another unvaccinated child died in the measles outbreak. An 8-year-old girl was the second fatality there this year.",
      "\"Once the assessment is complete, more CDC staff will be sent to Texas per Sec. Kennedy's order and the governor's request. The first teams deployed to Texas arrived on March and returned to CDC on April 1,\" McDonald said.",
      "Multiple agency staff working on the CDC's measles response were among the thousands cut from the agency last week, officials have told CBS News.",
      "A handful of employees at agencies within the department have been brought back to work so far, multiple officials said, at least through the end of the 60 day period before their layoff notices formally take effect.",
      "McDonald did not comment on whether laid-off staff who had been working on the agency's measles response would be among those Kennedy might reinstate.",
      "The ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states has driven this year's tally of U.S. measles cases to the highest levels seen since a large wave of cases in 2019, which was the worst in the U.S. in decades.",
      "While dozens of measles cases are reported every year, usually linked to undervaccinated travelers returning from trips outside the country, health authorities have warned that ongoing community spread of the virus this year is now threatening America's status of having eliminated endemic spread of the virus.",
      "There have been six measles outbreaks so far this year, a CDC spokesperson told CBS News on Friday. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring states makes up the majority of cases. Smaller outbreaks are also ongoing in New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.",
      "Details of the sixth outbreak have not yet been released, the spokesperson said, citing patient privacy.",
      "Kennedy calls vaccine \"most effective way\" to stop measles spread",
      "While in Texas, Kennedy also posted on X that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\" The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and is normally given in two doses in early childhood.",
      "Kennedy's range of statements about the measles vaccine in recent weeks have drawn scrutiny from health experts, including after a Fox News interview in which he falsely inflated the shot's risks.",
      "In a later post, Kennedy also said he had met with \"two extraordinary healers\" who he said have \"healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.\"",
      "Budesonide can sometimes help to treat respiratory illnesses, reducing inflammation in the lungs, said pediatrics professor Dr. James Campbell of the University of Maryland in an email in March. CBS News reached out to Campbell after Kennedy previously hailed \"miraculous and instantaneous recovery\" from use of these treatments.",
      "\"In 2025, we should not have to treat measles in the US because it is completely preventable, but of course, like all preventable diseases, we do,\" said Campbell.",
      "Campbell is vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that develops recommendations for treating measles and other infectious diseases.",
      "Clarithromycin, an antibacterial drug, has no effect on viruses like measles but can be used by doctors to treat coinfections from some bacterial pneumonias that sometimes develop in infected children, Campbell said. However, it does not work for all bacteria.",
      "\"These choices should be made on an individual basis by the doctors, not as sweeping recommendations for all children with measles,\" said Campbell. He said that the drugs don't have evidence proving they should be used as routine treatments for measles and cautioned against \"sweeping statements about how those singular choices related to treatment of measles in general.\"",
      "\"Vaccination will prevent measles, but for those who do get measles, rigorous studies, and not anecdotal reports, will help us to better treat them,\" said Campbell.",
      "Kennedy's embrace of alternative therapies has been contradicted by other health experts, including former Trump administration officials.",
      "\"My children and grandchildren will not die of measles, because they are vaccinated.\u00a0 And there is no substitute, nor any effective treatment, for measles,\" Dr. Brett Giroir, an adviser to the department this year, wrote in an opinion piece published by RealClearHealth last week.",
      "The editorial from Giroir, who previously worked as assistant secretary of health during President Trump's first term, was published before news of the second child to die in the Texas measles outbreak. In the U.S., a child last died from measles in 2015.",

    "summary": "Some people whose homes survived the Eaton wildfire in January are struggling to convince their insurers to test their properties for safety.",
    "story": [
      "All sense of survivors' guilt was fleeting for those residents whose homes remained standing after wildfires ripped through the Los Angeles area three months ago.",
      "Many worried that smoke from the Eaton wildfire that destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 18 people may have carried toxins, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals, into their homes. But they struggled to convince their insurers to test their properties to ensure it was safe to return.",
      "Nicole Maccalla, a data scientist, said embers burned more than half of her roof, several windows and eaves were damaged, and her house in Altadena was left filled with ash, debris, soot and damaged appliances. She said her insurance adjuster said USAA would pay for contamination testing, but after choosing a company and coming back with the results, her claim was rejected. The adjuster said the company only covered testing in homes with major damage.",
      "\"Every single item is a battle,\" said Maccalla. \"It's denials and appeals and denials and appeals, and you wait weeks and weeks and weeks for responses.\"",
      "Maccalla and others banded together as Eaton Fire Residents United, sharing indoor environmental testing data and compiling the results in an online map. Of 81 homes tested so far for lead, all show elevated levels, according to the group.",
      "\"I've already had multiple people reach out and say: 'Thank you for publishing this map \u2026 because my insurance company has changed their mind and approved testing,'\" said Maccalla, who helped design the data collection to verify results and maintain privacy.",
      "Many homeowners paid privately for the testing after their insurance companies refused, revealing gaps in coverage. The group hopes the data will help residents who can't afford it to convince their insurers to cover testing and remediation.",
      "\"If I can prove my community is not fit for human habitation then maybe I can show my home won't be,\" said Jane Lawton Potelle, founder of Eaton Fire Residents United.",
      "It's not easy to understand how and when it is safe to return home, Potelle said. The fine print of insurance policies can be frustrating and confusing, and the government has not stepped in to help.",
      "No help from FEMA",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has no plans to conduct widespread environmental testing. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is tracking environmental testing largely by academic researchers and a handful from government agencies, but most studies assess outdoor contamination.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven't standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don't torch the property.",
      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara released a bulletin in March that put the onus on companies to properly investigate reported smoke damage, saying they cannot deny such claims without investigating thoroughly, including paying for professional testing as warranted. But many residents have been left to fight for coverage anyway.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute that represents many major insurance companies, said it's hard to compare neighbors because every claim is unique due to each home's physical structure, actual damage and defined insurance coverage limits.",
      "\"It can vary and insurance companies are sensitive to what the claim is,\" Ruiz said. \"You have to work with your insurance companies and be reasonable about what may have happened.\"",
      "Disputes over fire damage coverage",
      "Dave Jones, director of the Climate Risk Initiative at University of California, Berkeley, and former state insurance commissioner, said testing should be covered even though some insurance companies disagree.",
      "\"It's perfectly reasonable for people to have some kind of environmental test done so that their home is safe and their property is safe,\" Jones said. \"We're talking about very catastrophically high temperature fires where all sorts of materials are melted and some of them become toxic.\"",
      "The state's insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over how it handles smoke damage claims. A 2017 change to the FAIR Plan limited coverage to \"permanent physical changes,\" meaning smoke damage must be visible or detectable without lab testing for claims to be approved. State officials said that threshold was too high and illegal, and ordered a change.",
      "Dylan Schaffer, an attorney leading a class action lawsuit challenging FAIR Plan's threshold, said he was surprised private carriers are disputing similar fire damage claims.",
      "\"The damage is not due to smoke, the damage is contamination from fire,\" Schaffer said. \"They make it complicated because it saves them money.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Altadena residents on the FAIR Plan say their claims are still being denied. Jones believes the debate will only end when lawmakers take action.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean declined to comment on the ongoing litigation and individual cases, but said the FAIR Plan pays all covered claims based on the adjusters' recommendations.",
      "\"Our policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage,\" McLean said.",
      "Potelle said the first inkling that her house might be toxic came after meeting with her AAA insurance adjuster in the days after the fire. Even though she had worn a mask, her chest still ached and her voice rasped, and she wondered whether her home was safe for her 11-year-old.",
      "Stephanie Wilcox said her toddler's pediatrician recommended testing their home. Her Farmers Insurance policy includes coverage for lead and asbestos in addition to her wildfire coverage, but after multiple denials, she paid out of pocket.",
      "\"After the initial inspection, (Farmers) had told us remediation would cost about $12,000 and that it would be habitable, like we could move back in tomorrow,\" she said. \"But now there's no way.\"",
      "She plans to ask for a new estimate including lead abatement and other costs, citing the results.",
      "Similarly, Zach Bailey asked in late January for contamination testing. The house he shares with his wife and toddler sits in an island of largely spared homes among blocks wiped out by the fire. After months of denials, State Farm agreed to pay for lead and asbestos testing because the remediation company cited federal worker safety regulations.",
      "It shouldn't have been that hard, he said.",
      "\"It feels like the insurance companies should have a playbook at this point,\" he said. \"They should have a process to keep people safe because this isn't the first disaster like this.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's volley of tariffs has U.S. companies scrambling for ways to absorb \u2014 and if possible avoid \u2014 the added business costs.",
      "Some enterprises, from small businesses to nationally recognized brands, have already announced higher prices, citing President Trump's tariffs. While others, from footwear companies to furniture brands, are warning consumers to brace for increased costs to come.",
      "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told\u00a0CNBC\u00a0Thursday that he expects the tariffs to lead to higher prices on a host of consumers goods, noting that the site's third-party sellers are likely to pass on tariff-related costs.",
      "Some consumers are also preparing for price hikes by\u00a0stocking up on goods\u00a0they think are likely to become more expensive if U.S. \"reciprocal levies\" on dozens of countries,\u00a0which are paused for 90 days, take effect.",
      "A 10% tariff on all U.S. imports remains in place. China, which accounts for nearly a third of all goods imported into the U.S., faces levies of up to 145% for some items. In an escalation of the trade war between the world's two largest economics, Beijing fired back Friday by announcing it will hike duties on American exports from 84% to 125% and deriding Mr. Trump's tariffs as a \"joke.\"",
      "Tariff fees on what you buy",
      "Although the tariffs and retaliatory moves by other countries have yet to hit economic growth, U.S. businesses aren't waiting around. Some are introducing \"tariff surcharges,\" announcing new prices on their websites and in letters to consumers.",
      "Labucq, which sells high-end footwear that is fabricated in Italy, addressed tariffs and their effect on pricing in a recent social media\u00a0post. The company said a 20% U.S. tariff on imports from the European Union, which Mr. Trump announced on April 2 before pausing them, would require the company to hike prices by 10% beginning April 15. Labucq said its pricing will then jump by an additional roughly 10% on May 7, noting the increases are necessary for it to \"remain sustainable.\"",
      "Dame, a sexual wellness brand that makes adult toys and personal care products, has implemented a $5 \"Trump tariff surcharge\" that is automatically added to customers' online shopping carts at checkout.",
      "Dame CEO Alexandra Fine said the fee doesn't cover all of its extra costs and that the company is analyzing its pricing given that most of its products are made in China. \"Our whole industry is in China, so we've already seen the impact,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Fine also said she wants to be transparent with customers about what is happening, rather than quietly inflating prices.",
      "\"The intention of adding the Trump tariff surcharge as a line item at checkout was to remind people that this is an extra tax on us. I wanted people to understand why it's more expensive \u2014 that it's because of political decisions that were made,\" she said.",
      "Other companies are also moving to raise prices. In a quarterly earnings call last month, a senior executive with U.S. chip maker Micron said some of its products would be subject to higher U.S. tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China and that it plans to \"pass those costs along to our customers.\"",
      "Honeywell Building Automation, which designs safety and efficiency systems for buildings, in early March announced new pricing related to fresh tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. The company started applying a 6.4% \"tariff surcharge\" on its building management systems, excluding software and subscription services, saying the move was necessary \"to mitigate the impact of tariffs.\" Honeywell also said it would eliminate the extra duty \"as soon as such tariffs are no longer in force.\"",
      "Lemonade out of lemons",
      "Other companies are using the situation as a promotional tool. While it's true that consumers could eventually pay more if they wait to purchase furniture, electronics, automobiles and more, \"pre-tariff sales\" play into consumers' fear that prices could rise, and can be an effective way to boost sales, according to experts.",
      "\"The tariffs are injecting uncertainty into the marketplace and when there is high uncertainty, consumers tend to overestimate their losses, so they try to hedge their losses as much as possible in a very irrational way,\" Denish Shah, professor of marketing at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "And in times of market uncertainty, explains Denish, consumers are prone to panic-buying.",
      "\"They tend to stockpile necessities, fearing that tomorrow, suddenly, prices could go up. So they'll say, 'Let me try to accelerate all the purchases I can that I would have made anyway,'\" he said.",
      "That said, consumers' overarching goal, particularly after battling years of relentless inflation, is to save money. \"Consumers are very price-sensitive in this environment, so they are going to react very strongly to sales that companies are promoting,\" Shah added.",
      "The pre-tariff sales strategy is already working for some sellers, such as Burlap & Barrel, a spice company that imports single-origin spices from around the world. It sources ingredients from small farms in Guatemala, Iceland, India, Spain, Turkey, Vietnam and more. Over the weekend, the spice importer announced\u00a0a \"spring cleaning-turned-impromptu Tariff sale,\" marking down all products by 20%, through Tuesday.",
      "\"When we planned this sale, we thought it'd be a routine springtime promotion, but in the last few days it has turned into something very, very different,\" Burlap & Barrel wrote in a social media post. The company said that it's waiting to see how tariffs are applied to its products, but it's sure that they \"will be bad for our business,\" given that it cannot easily overhaul its supply chains.",
      "The company states that it is running the sale \"To show that we're serious about not raising our prices, and to finance another year or purchasing from smallholder farmers in the face of economic instability and political crisis.\"",
      "Another company, Freewrite, sent an email to customers on Friday urging them to buy its digital typewriters before it hikes prices on its China-made products next week due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Everyone, including our contract manufacturing partners, is helping us explore our options, but the truth is that it is incredibly difficult to move factories. It takes careful planning, huge expense and much more time than we have,\" Freewrite CEO Adam Leeb wrote in the email. \"On Monday, we will be raising prices. Not because we want to, but because we have to.\"",
      "Large chains are putting their own spin on tariff-related promotions. Furniture maker Raymour & Flanigan is urging customers to \"lock in pre-tariff pricing\" in a banner on its website. The company does not indicate what kind of price hikes it could implement in the future, though, as a result of the new levies.",

      "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the U.S. economy faces a critical stretch, while also warning of the ongoing uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariff policies.",
      "\"The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and 'trade wars,' ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility,\" he said Friday during the banking giant's first-quarter earnings call.",
      "Dimon told Wall Street analysts that JPMorgan expects tariffs to increase inflation roughly 0.5% this year. But he also expressed confidence that the Trump administration is eager to negotiate trade agreements with other countries, which would ease the strain on the economy.",
      "\"I would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think that will be good for everybody, and they want to do it, too,\" he said.",
      "Dimon, considered the country's most influential banking leader, said earlier this week that U.S. tariffs could lead to higher inflation, weaker economic growth and potentially even a recession.",
      "\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" he said in his annual shareholder letter Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump this week\u00a0paused most country-based tariffs\u00a0for 90 days \u2014 a move that came as CEOs and Wall Street investors publicly pressed the White House to reconsider its trade measures and as financial markets gave a resounding thumb's down to U.S. trade policies.",
      "After suspending the \"reciprocal\" tariffs, Mr. Trump said he had watched an interview with Dimon on Fox Business in which the banker said the tariffs would make a recession a \"likely outcome,\" according to Bloomberg.",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:27:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Recent cuts eliminated a small, specialized workforce that sets the poverty standards determining who is eligible for Medicaid as well as assistance with food, home heating, child care, and more.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's firings at the Department of Health and Human Services included the entire office that sets federal poverty guidelines, which determine whether tens of millions of Americans are eligible for health programs such as Medicaid, food assistance, child care, and other services, former staff said.",
      "The small team, with technical data expertise, worked out of HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. Their dismissal mirrored others across HHS, which came without warning and left officials puzzled as to why they were \"RIF'ed\" \u2014 as in \"reduction in force,\" the bureaucratic language used to describe the firings.",
      "\"I suspect they RIF'ed offices that had the word 'data' or 'statistics' in them,\" said one of the laid-off employees, a social scientist whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because the person feared further recrimination. \"It was random, as far as we can tell.\"",
      "Among those fired was Kendall Swenson, who had led development of the poverty guidelines for many years and was considered the repository of knowledge on the issue, according to the social scientist and two academics who have worked with the HHS team.",
      "The sacking of the office could lead to cuts in assistance to low-income families next year unless the Trump administration restores the positions or moves its duties elsewhere, said Robin Ghertner, the fired director of the Division of Data and Technical Analysis, which had overseen the guidelines.",
      "The poverty guidelines are \"needed by many people and programs,\" said Timothy Smeeding, a professor emeritus of economics at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. \"If you're thinking of someone you fired who should be rehired, Swenson would be a no-brainer,\" he added.",
      "Under a 1981 appropriations bill, HHS is required annually to take Census Bureau poverty-line figures, adjust them for inflation, and create guidelines that agencies and states use to determine who is eligible for various types of help.",
      "There's a special sauce for creating the guidelines that includes adjustments and calculations, Ghertner said. Swenson and three other staff members would independently prepare the numbers and quality-check them together before they were issued each January.",
      "Everyone in Ghertner's office was told last week, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said.",
      "\"There's literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,\" he said. \"And because we're all locked out of our computers, we can't teach anyone how to calculate them.\"",
      "ASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "HHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired.",
      "\"These workers were told they couldn't come into their offices so there's no transfer of knowledge,\" said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. \"They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.\"",
      "HHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE \"as part of Secretary Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,\"\u00a0 spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. \"Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office\" and \"HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,\" she said in a written response to KFF Health News.",
      "After this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF'ed data analysis team, which had nine members. \"The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,\" he said. \"Eighty million people will not be affected.\"",
      "Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency's lobby.",
      "The group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee \"and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.\"",
      "Matt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues.",
      "ASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi's senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies.",
      "\"These HHS staffing cuts \u2014 20,000 \u2014 obviously they are completely nuts,\" Primus said. \"These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There's no rhyme or reasons to what they're doing.\"",
      "HHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said.",
      "And sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four.",
      "\"If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn't buy you the same,\" he said, \"but if the guidelines haven't increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.\"",
      "The 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.",
      "As of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility.",
      "Eligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level.",
      "One in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility.",
      "Former employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration's objectives. \"We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,\" the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" rubric. \"Even if it didn't align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.\"",

    "summary": "A new breed of veterinary clinic is changing how pets \u2014 and their owners \u2014 are treated. \"I'd rather see four pets a day,\" one vet said.",
    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At  VEG ER for Pets, this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG ER for Pets represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG ER for Pets focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Glattstein, co-founder and president of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG ER for Pets' most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals, where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Glattstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG ER for Pets has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG ER for Pets is now independently able to do that,\" Glattstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Glattstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

      "The S&P 500 fell 189 points, or 3.5%, Thursday to close at 5,268. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,015 points, or 2.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite sank 4.3%.",
      "China this week announced more countermeasures against the U.S., and market losses accelerated after the White House clarified that it will tax Chinese imports at 145%, not 125% as initially announced by Mr. Trump on social media. The swings also hit the bond market despite a better-than-expected report on inflation. U.S. crude oil prices fell more than 3%.",
      "It's been a wild couple of weeks on Wall Street with Mr. Trump's tariff announcements,\u00a0reversals and retaliation from U.S. trading partners. That volatility seems unlikely to change in the coming weeks with the U.S. and China still locked in a tit-for-tat tariff battle and earnings season kicking off on Friday with the latest results from some of the nation's biggest banks.",
      "\"Despite Wednesday's announcements to lower the reciprocal tariff rate for most countries to 10%, the escalation between the U.S. and China could dramatically impact trade between the world's two largest economies,\" said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer for wealth management at UBS, in a research note.",
      "Taking into account Mr. Trump's 145% levy on Chinese imports, UBS currently estimates the overall U.S.\u00a0effective tariff rate at 27%, versus 9% prior to April 2. \"Excluding trade with China, the effective tariff rate is 11%,\" Haefele added.",
      "\"Everything is still very volatile, because with Donald Trump, you don't know what to expect,\" said Francis Lun, chief executive of Geo Securities. \"This is really big uncertainty in the market. The threat of recession has not faded.\"",
      "Markets had been sinking earlier Wednesday on worries that Mr. Trump's trade war could drag the global economy into a recession. But then came the posting on social media that investors worldwide had been waiting and wishing for.",
      "\"I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE,\" Mr. Trump said, saying more than 75 countries are negotiating on trade and not retaliating against his latest increases in tariffs. China was a huge exception, with the president raising tariffs\u00a0 on its products to 145%.",
      "Investors went \"from fear to euphoria,\" Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said in a commentary. On Wednesday, following Mr. Trump's tariff-pause announcement, the S&P 500 surged 9.5%, its third-best day since 1940. The index is still below where it was when Trump announced his sweeping set of tariffs last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot to a gain of nearly 3,000 points, or 7.9%. The Nasdaq composite leaped 12.2%.",
      "\"It's now a manageable risk, especially as global recession tail bets get unwound, and most of Asia's exporters breathe a massive sigh of relief,\" Innes said. Analysts had expected the global comeback given that U.S. stocks had one of their best days in history on Wednesday as investors registered their relief over Trump's decision.",
      "The trade war isn't over, and an escalating battle between the world's two largest economies can create plenty of damage. U.S. stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago. Technology stocks were the biggest drag on markets in early trading Thursday, followed by the industrial and the financial sectors.",
      "CPI report brings good news",
      "On a positive note, the U.S. government's latest consumer inflation data revealed inflation in March\u00a0rose\u00a02.4% on an annual basis, a sign of progress in the Federal Reserve's battle to\u00a0bring down inflation\u00a0to a 2% rate.",
      "\"This month's inflation report showed that CPI dropped across the board in March, which is welcome news for the Federal Reserve, which would like to cut rates if significant damage is done to the economy through increased tariffs, but otherwise would be reluctant to cut rates in the face of an inflation threat,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management.",
      "March \"saw a fairly big cooling in inflation (both headline and core) and this, coupled w/the healthy job adds from last week, point to robust underlying economic fundamentals. The downtick in inflation gives breathing room for the Fed to be more forceful in responding to market turmoil,\" said equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, in a report.",
      "From bear investors' perspective, however, \"inflation is still running above the Fed's target and regardless, Mar and Q1 numbers are irrelevant given how much the world has changed. Trump's tariffs are only hitting the economy now, and it will take months before they fully show up in the data,\" Crisafulli added.",
      "In other words, according to most analysts, the situation is still too uncertain to call.",
      "\"It's much too soon to blow the all clear \u2014 both on tariffs or on inflation \u2014 since the tariff damage has only been postponed as of now, and will only be relieved if tariff deals can be struck across the board,\" Zaccarelli said.",
      "\"Inflation still remains a concern because the full impact of tariffs is yet to be felt, however, at least the underlying trends (e.g. non-tariff related inflation) seems benign at this time. We will be keeping a close eye on PPI tomorrow in order to determine whether or not future inflation is already in the pipeline,\" he added.",
      "In report Thursday, TD Securities analysts echoed that sentiment, saying, \"Indeed, uncertainty remains in the air as the outlook for consumer price inflation remains blurred by ongoing trade policy developments.\"",

      "On a monthly basis, prices actually fell 0.1% in March, the first monthly drop in nearly five years.",
      "Inflation eased last month due partly to lower fuel prices, with gasoline tumbling 9.8% on an annual basis, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "Another reason prices fell was sharp drops in travel-related costs, including airfares, which decreased 5.3% just from February to March. Hotel room prices dropped 3.5%.",
      "Economists said those declines in part reflected much slower international demand as the number of tourists visiting the United States has fallen sharply amid Trump's aggressive trade policy.",
      "Visits to the United States from overseas fell nearly 12% last month, according to government data.",
      "What experts say",
      "Easing inflation combined with President Trump's announcement yesterday of a 90-day pause in his reciprocal tariffs should help alleviate some concerns for the Federal Reserve when it meets on May 7 to make its next interest rate decision, said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank.",
      "But because other tariffs orchestrated by Mr. Trump have recently gone into effect \u2014 such as auto tariffs \u2013 inflation nevertheless could pick up later this year, experts say.",
      "Yet March's data is \"backward looking\" and doesn't reflect the trade policy changes orchestrated by the Trump administration, noted Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are still expected to lift inflation later in the year as the impact of the import duties trickle through the economy. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Walmart when they accept shipments of foreign goods, they typically pass off all or some of the tariff cost onto consumers through higher prices.",
      "The president's 90-day pause excludes China, a major exporter to the U.S., which will continue to face tariffs of 125% on its goods. And Mr. Trump's 10% universal duty will also likely to push up prices in the coming months, economists say. The higher import taxes will likely weigh on the economy's growth as well.",
      "What the CPI shows about egg prices",
      "Although consumer prices cooled in March, the CPI data showed egg prices continued to inch higher last month. According to the CPI figures, egg prices increased in March to reach a new record-high of $6.23 despite a drop in wholesale prices and no egg farms having bird flu outbreaks.",
      "More recently, grocers have told CBS News that egg prices are\u00a0showing signs of easing.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks were cited as the major cause of price spikes in January and February after more than 30 million egg-laying chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the disease.",
      "Since the current bird flu outbreak began, more than 168 million birds have been slaughtered, most of them egg-laying chickens. Any time a bird gets sick, the entire flock is killed to help keep bird flu from spreading. That can have an effect on the egg supply because massive egg farms may have millions of birds.",
      "What the CPI means for your money",
      "Despite today's cooler-than-expected CPI numbers, inflationary risks are still a threat to the U.S. economy, especially as some of Mr. Trump's tariffs are still in place while others are merely delayed, experts say.",
      "\"Going forward, the Fed is likely to face a difficult trade-off as tariff-driven price increases start to feed through to the inflation data and activity remains soft,\" Haigh said. \"We expect the Fed's initial reaction to be cautious, but the risks remain that a sharper than expected slowdown in the economy could result in a resumption of the Fed's easing cycle.\"",
      "Three of four economists polled by FactSet expect the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting on May 7. The current federal funds \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 now stands in a range 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That means consumers and businesses are unlikely to see any relief on loan rates in the near term, although economists are penciling in cuts later in the year, with the majority forecasting a reduction at the Fed's June 18 meeting.",

      "Sony, which produces the two iconic game shows, filed a complaint in October 2024 alleging that CBS entered into unauthorized licensing agreements.

    "summary": "President Trump had brushed off the stock market's plunge, but turmoil in the bond market got his administration's attention.",
    "story": [
      "Even as stocks plunged in reaction to his administration's sweeping tariffs, President Trump expressed\u00a0confidence in his trade policies, saying last week that \"markets are going to boom.\" But by Wednesday, a collective thumb's down to the tariffs by bond investors had given Mr. Trump pause.",
      "With U.S. and global financial market tumbling, he abruptly suspended his administration's \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of other countries for 90 days, acknowledging that the bond market was \"getting a little queasy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's about-face was by no means the first time a sitting American president had blinked in the face of bond investors expressing alarm over U.S. policies they viewed as fiscally reckless and harmful to their portfolios. In their first terms, both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also found themselves knocked back when the bond market rebelled at the cost of some of their strategic priorities.",
      "The \"bond vigilantes\" ride again",
      "Americans might think of bonds as a less risky asset class they turn to in their 401(k)s to offset more volatile investments, such as stock. But the $2.8 trillion Treasury market is also a bedrock of the U.S. government. The federal government finances the country's debt by selling Treasury bills to investors, who prize the asset because of the country's sterling credit rating and its guarantee of making good on interest payments.",
      "As the Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs went into effect on Wednesday, the bond prices slid and the yield on 2-year Treasury notes rose by as much as 0.3 percentage points, marking the biggest intraday move since 2009, according to financial data firm FactSet. (Bond prices move in inverse relation to their interest rates, or yields.)",
      "Such sudden moves can signal that investors are dumping their bonds. That pushes bond prices lower but boosts yields, which are the returns that bond holders pay to investors.",
      "\"Why is this happening? Fixed-income investors may be starting to worry that the Chinese and other foreigners might start selling their U.S. Treasuries,\" economist Ed Yardeni said in an April 8 research note.",
      "Yardeni, who coined the term \"bond vigilantes\" in the 1980s to describe fixed-income investors who express their disapproval of government policies by dumping Treasuries, added that the bond market was cautioning that \"the Trump administration may be playing with liquid nitro.\"",
      "In another report after Mr. Trump announced the tariff pause, Yardeni noted, \"The Bond Vigilantes have struck again. As far as we can tell, at least with respect to U.S. financial markets, they are the only 1.000 hitters in history.\"",
      "Some Trump administration officials acknowledged that the bond market's hostile reaction to the tariffs influenced the decision to pause the tariffs.",
      "\"[The] bond market was telling us, 'Hey, it is probably time to move,'\" White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett\u00a0said\u00a0on CNBC on Thursday.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump announced his April 2 tariffs, economists raised concerns\u00a0about the potential impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The president claimed the tariffs, which he called \"reciprocal\" because they were aimed at equalizing the trade barriers between the U.S. and its trading partners, would help revive manufacturing to the U.S. and raise revenue for the federal government.",
      "But experts warned that the tariffs, which ranged from a baseline 10% for most nations up to more than 100% for Chinese imports, raised the risks of a recession and would likely reignite inflation. Investors dumped stocks and bonds as they digested the economic risks of Mr. Trump's tariff barrage.",
      "While the stock market plunge hurt millions of Americans' retirement savings, the turmoil in the bond market creates very real pressures on the nation's finances. Because the Treasury Department pays interest to debt holders, any increase in yields puts more financial strain on the nation's coffers.",
      "\"Developments in the last 24 hours suggest we may be headed for serious financial crisis wholly induced by U.S. government tariff policy,\" Harvard University economist and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers\u00a0said\u00a0in an April 9 thread on social media.",
      "He added, \"Long-term interest rates are gapping up, even as the stock market moves sharply downwards. This highly unusual pattern suggests a generalized aversion to U.S. assets in global financial markets.  We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market.\"",
      "An expensive problem",
      "Given the size of the Treasury market, the surging bond yields and broader market turmoil could create an expensive problem for the federal government. For Mr. Trump, the timing was especially poor as he pushes Congress to pass an extension of his 2017 tax cuts, which are forecast to cost trillions over the next decade.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. spent more than $1 trillion to service its debt, more than double its roughly $500 billion in 2020, according to Treasury data. That's largely due to higher interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve to battle the post-pandemic surge in inflation.",
      "An increase in bond yields could add to that expense, putting even more pressure on the federal budget.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market selloff, once the bond market began to weaken, too, it was only a matter of time before he folded on his eye-wateringly high tariffs,\" noted economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics in an April 9 research note.",

      "The final value of the deal will be adjusted at closing, expected in the second half of the year. It will be funded by 1.5 billion euros in new debt and has been approved by the Prada and Capri Holdings board of directors.",

      "Versace, founded in 1978 by the late Gianni Versace, has been owned since 2018 by Capri Holdings, which includes Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.",
      "Capri Holdings paid $2 billion for Versace, but had been struggling in the recent era of \"quiet luxury'' to position the stalwart of Italian fashion with its sexy silhouettes and loud patterns.",
      "Last month, Capri Holdings named Dario Vitale as creative director to replace Donatella Versace, who assumed the role after her brother's 1997 murder. Vitale came from Miu Miu, the stunningly successful youth-driven brand in the Prada Group.",
      "Versace was given the new role of chief brand ambassador in the shakeup, which was widely viewed as setting the scene for the long-rumored Prada sale. Miuccia Prada acknowledged the group's interest on the sidelines of Milan Fashion Week in February.",

By contrast, a 125% \"reciprocal tariff\" on China remains in effect.",

      "On Wall Street, the S&P 500 surged 9.5%, an amount that would count as a good year for the market. It had been sinking earlier in the day on worries that Mr. Trump's trade war could drag the global economy into a recession. But then came the posting on social media that investors worldwide had been waiting and wishing for.",
      "\"I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE,\" the president said, after recognizing the more than 75 countries that he said have been negotiating on trade and hadn't retaliated against his latest increases in tariffs.",

      "China was a huge exception, though, with Mr. Trump saying tariffs are going up to 125% against its products. That raises the possibility of more swings ahead that could stun financial markets. The trade war isn't over, and an escalating battle between the world's two largest economies can create plenty of damage. U.S. stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago, when Trump announced worldwide tariffs on what he called \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But on Wednesday, at least, the focus on Wall Street was on the positive. The Dow shot to a gain of 2,962 points, or 7.9%. The Nasdaq composite leaped 12.2%. And the S&P 500 had its third-best day since 1940.",
      "The relief came after doubts had crept in about whether Mr. Trump cared about the financial pain the U.S. stock market was taking because of his tariffs. The S&P 500, the index that sits at the center of many 401(k) accounts, came into the day nearly 19% below the record its set less than two months ago.",
      "That surprised many professional investors who'd long thought a president who used to crow about records for the Dow under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent markets reeling.",
      "Wednesday's rally pulled the S&P 500 index away from the edge of what's called a \"bear market.\" That's what professionals call it when a run-of-the-mill drop of 10% for U.S. stocks, which happens every year or so, graduates into a more vicious fall of 20%. The index is now down 11.2% from its record.",
      "Bonds rebound",
      "Wall Street also got a boost from a relatively smooth auction of U.S. Treasurys on Wednesday. Earlier jumps in Treasury yields had indicated increasing levels of stress and Trump said he had been watching the bond market \"getting a little queasy.\"",
      "Higher yields on Treasurys put pressure on the stock market and push upward on rates for mortgages and other loans for U.S. households and businesses. U.S. Treasury yields have historically dropped - not risen - during volatile times because the bonds are usually seen as some of the safest possible investments.",
      "This week's sharp rise had brought the yield on the 10-year Treasury back to where it was in late February.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 08:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's aggressive use of tariffs has fueled concerns about the economy and roiled the stock market.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's barrage of \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world this year has rattled consumers, businesses and investors. Although President Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, he upped import duties on Chinese goods to 125% \u2014 escalating a conflict between the world's two largest economies.",
      "We asked you what questions you had about tariffs and answered some of those in a CBS News 24/7 special. Read on for some answers to your questions below.",
      "Are global tariffs legal, and have U.S. levies on other countries risen or fallen over the years?",
      "CBS MoneyWatch: Tariffs are legal under World Trade Organization rules, although participating countries must comply with certain restrictions and levies are generally capped.",
      "As a result, nations have long had the right to impose multilateral tariffs, although those costs vary widely based on trade agreements, product type and many other factors.",
      "In the 19th century, average U.S. tariff rates on trading partners routinely exceeded 30%. The government sharply reduced those levies after the Great Depression, cutting them to single digits. After resuming power in 2025, President Trump raised the effective U.S. tariff to 22% \u2014 the highest since 1909.",
      "For the Trump administration, are these massive tariffs intended to pressure other nations into more favorable trade deals, or is the goal to push American businesses to invest more in domestic manufacturing? Or both?",
      "Both, correct. These historically large tariffs have several main objectives. In the short term, the tariffs are intended to pressure countries to come to the table to negotiate what Mr. Trump sees as more favorable trade deals.",
      "Over the long term, Trump administration officials say that sharply raising U.S. tariffs will spur both domestic and foreign companies eager to avoid the added costs to expand here at home, creating jobs, reinvigorating manufacturers and boosting economic growth.",
      "President Trump has also long argued that global trade rules, enshrined in entities like the World Trade Organization, disdvantage the U.S. by, for example, permitting countries like China, Germany and Japan to subsidize key industries. He blames those rules for fueling large global trade imbalances that have saddled the U.S. with a large, and growing, trade deficit.",
      "Another goal of tariffs is to generate federal revenue \u2014 funds that Mr. Trump will likely need to offset additional tax cuts he has promised to Americans and to corporations.",
      "Why do some people oppose deploying tariffs against countries that impose tariffs on the U.S.?",
      "Most mainstream economists think the kind of sweeping tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump on nearly all U.S. imports act as a tax on businesses and consumers. Such levies raise the cost of many essential items, leading to higher prices for American households; depress economic growth; and could even trigger a recession.",
      "Under this view, a trade war in which countries jack up tariffs on their economic partners effectively makes them all poorer.",
      "By contrast, trade experts also say that targeted tariffs \u2014 implemented as but one element in a larger industrial strategy \u2014 can help protect critical U.S. industries and workers from unfair foreign competition.",
      "How do these tariffs impact consumers, especially when it comes to prices on everyday items like groceries or housewares?",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers such as Walmart, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass on most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of those appliances jumped more than 11%, tacking on about $86 to the cost of a new unit, according to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "While consumers can opt for U.S.-made merchandise, domestic manufacturers also may raise their prices due to tariffs. Sometimes that's due to an increase in the cost of imported goods they need to manufacture their products. But some companies also take the opportunity to hike prices because the newly expensive foreign-made products provide them with more pricing flexibility.",
      "Without Mr. Trump's pause, imported vegetables, fruit and nuts were set to rise by 19% due to the tariffs, according to a recent analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, a public policy think tank. That would have boosted prices for those foods by more than 6%, after adjusting for an expected 0.6% increase in the cost of the same items grown in the U.S.",
      "What's the long-term outlook \u2014 are these tariffs likely to strengthen the U.S. economy or just cause temporary disruption?",
      "Economists say Mr. Trump's tariffs have increased the risk that the U.S. and other nations could tumble into a recession in the next year. Because tariffs raise prices, Americans are expected to cut back on spending \u2014 a potentially major problem given that 70 cents of every $1 in the nation's gross domestic product is based on consumer spending.",
      "For instance, the tariffs could slow GDP growth to 1.4% in 2025, while core inflation could rise to 3.9% this year, according to an April 2 forecast from Oxford Economics. That would represent a significant slowdown from the economy's 2.8% growth rate in 2024.",
      "Other experts say leaving sharply higher U.S. tariffs in place could leave much deeper scars. GDP growth could fall by 0.6 percentage points over the next decade, the Yale Budget Lab estimated.",
      "What is the end goal for the Trump administration's tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has said he believes tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs. By making it more expensive to sell foreign-made goods in the U.S., the president wants to convince American and foreign companies to build factories here.",
      "But he's also highlighted other goals for his tariff barrage, such as convincing other nations to give more favorable trading terms to the U.S.",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a way to raise billions in revenue for the U.S. government, even though economists point out that tariffs are essentially a sales tax which are paid by American consumers.",
      "Does Mr. Trump really think he's going to be able to rebuild manufacturing in America again?",
      "Mr. Trump is adamant that tariffs can revive manufacturing in the U.S., which has been on the decline for at least half a century. Yet economists and other experts aren't so sure.",
      "There are several reasons for their skepticism. For one, building the types of factories and infrastructure to support the manufacturing that is now handled by other nations, such as China and Vietnam, would require years and billions in investment.",
      "The U.S. manufacturing sector has been shrinking for decades, so companies repatriating factories from abroad would struggle to find enough skilled workers, especially in technology and other areas higher up the industrial value chain",
      "And because of the uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, some businesses might not want to commit to such an investment given that the import duties might disappear or be sharply lowered \u2014 as they were today.",
      "What could happen to block the U.S. tariff increases?",
      "Several factors could halt the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump, according to experts.",
      "First, Congress could introduce a resolution to terminate the emergency declaration used by Mr. Trump to issue the tariffs. Since both the Senate and House are controlled by Republicans, that would require several members of the GOP to join Democrats in voting against Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "But Mr. Trump would likely veto any such measure that reached his desk, which means that two-thirds of both chambers would need to vote in favor of the measure in order to make it veto-proof.",
      "Second, the courts could intervene and rule that Mr. Trump has exceeded his authority. Already, there has been a lawsuit filed by a small business in Florida that argues that Mr. Trump has overstepped by issuing the April 2 tariffs, and that the power should belong to Congress alone.",
      "Third, the violent reaction in financial markets that followed Mr. Trump's latest tariff salvo could persuade him to change course. His move on Wednesday to pause many of the tariffs followed a five-day plunge in stocks that put the S&P 500 on the verge of entering a bear market \u2014 when equities fall at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "That steep decline in stock prices hurts tens of millions of Americans saving for retirement and could lead them to cut their spending, a big drag on economic growth.",

      "The S&P 500's gain was the biggest one-day increase since October 2008, according to financial services company Factset. The Nasdaq's gains were its\u00a0largest since 2001, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "One notable exception to Mr. Trump's decision is China, with the president saying he's increasing the tariff rate on goods imported from that nation to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Prior to the announcement, the S&P 500 had been down about 17% from its mid-February peak, pushing stocks toward a bear market, or when shares fall more than 20% from their most recent high, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "Even with today's gain, the S&P 500 remains 11% below its February 19 peak of 6,147.",
      "Investors have been spooked by Mr. Trump's escalating trade war, which Wall Street economists warn could raise the risk of a recession and hurt U.S. corporations and consumers by hiking prices on products from almost every nation.",
      "Even before Mr. Trump's announcement, some on Wall Street had expressed optimism that the White House could back down from the latest tariffs, which slapped rates of between 10% to 84% on U.S. trade partners.",
      "Despite the pause, experts noted that uncertainty remains an issue for U.S. businesses, given that the tariffs could restart in 90 days and that the penalties on China \u2014 a major trading partner \u2014 are likely to dampen economic growth.",
      "\"Businesses will be relieved that the destination for trade policy looks like it could be less disruptive than seemed possible yesterday,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. \"Even so, the huge overhang of policy uncertainty will weigh on investment and weak decisions in the next few months.\"",
      "He noted, \"Also, 125% tariffs on Chinese imports will be a huge problem for many businesses if they stay in place.\"",
      "Best stock performers today",
      "The gains were widespread across the U.S. stock market, and 98% of the stocks in the S&P 500 index rallied.",
      "Among the best performers were tech stocks, including chipmaker Nvidia, which gained 18.7%, and Apple, which jumped more than 15%.",
      "Also leading the way were airlines and other stocks that depend on customers feeling confident enough to travel for work or for vacation. Delta Air Lines soared 23.4%, while American Airlines gained 22.6%.",
      "China trade war intensifies",
      "Still, the trade war continues between the U.S. and China continues to rage. On Wednesday, China said it is raising its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%, up from its previously announced 34%, after President Trump's import duties on Chinese good\u00a0went into effect\u00a0today at a rate of 104%. The retaliation signals Beijing isn't backing down from Mr. Trump's global trade war.",
      "Mr. Trump's broad-based \"reciprocal tariffs,\" which apply to imports of almost every nation, had kicked in after midnight Eastern time in the U.S.",
      "Already, there are signs that some corporations are feeling the impact of Mr. Trump's tariff policies, with Delta on Wednesday pulling its guidance for 2025 as the trade war depresses bookings across the travel sector.",

      "\"China's position is clear and consistent: the door to talks is open, but dialogue must be conducted on an equal basis with mutual respect,\" Commerce Ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian said. \"China will stand by its position until the end. Pressuring, threatening, and blackmailing are not the correct ways to deal with China. We hope that the U.S. will work with China. Based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and a win-win cooperation, we will properly resolve differences through dialogue and consultation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced a pause on the planned implementation of higher tariffs for almost all nations late Wednesday, leaving a 10% universal tariff in place, but said he was raising tariffs on China from 104% to 125%. The heightened levies took effect Thursday, at the same time as Beijing's retaliatory tariffs of 84% took effect on U.S. imports to China.",
      "\"I have reiterated China's position many times, and it is very clear. We do not provoke trouble, nor do we fear trouble. The legitimate development rights of the Chinese people and the people of the world cannot be taken away. China's and like all other countries' sovereignty, security, and development interests should not be infringed upon,\" He said.",
      "China's foreign ministry took a harsher stance, and vowed to fight on.",
      "\"The U.S.'s reckless and unjust actions go against the will of the people and are doomed to fail in the end,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said. \"I want to reiterate that in a tariff war or trade war, there are no winners. China does not want a trade war, but we are not afraid of one. We will never stand by and watch the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people be undermined, nor will we allow international trade rules and the multilateral trading system to be trampled upon. If the United States insists on waging a tariff war or trade war, China will fight to the end.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he believed he could come to a resolution with China.",
      "\"China wants to make a deal,\" the president said at the White House. \"They just don't know how quite to go about it.\"",
      "EU announces its own 90-day pause on any retaliatory tariffs",
      "In other parts of the world, as markets rallied in response to Mr. Trump's tariff rollback after days of steep losses, leaders and economists continued to express concern about economic uncertainty, but there was also more potentially positive news for stock traders.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a social media post that the 27-nation bloc would put its own plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports on hold for 90 days, matching Mr. Trump's latest move.",
      "\"We want to give negotiations a chance,\" Von der Leyen said. \"While finalizing the adoption of the EU countermeasures that saw strong support from our Member States, we will put them on hold for 90 days.\"",

      "The tariff rate of 10% includes the European Union. It's unclear what will happen after the 90-day period concludes, while countries negotiate with the Trump administration. Previous tariff rates on steel, aluminum and auto imports remain unchanged, a White House official said.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote: \"Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters during a race car event at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, the president was asked to explain how he reached a decision to issue the pause.",
      "\"Well, l thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, you know?\" the president said. \"They were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid, unlike these champions.\"",
      "\"I was watching the bond market,\" he added. \"The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it's, it's beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.\"",

      "\"President Trump wants to be personally involved,\" Bessent said in explaining the reason for the 90-day pause.",
      "\"No one creates leverage for himself like President Trump,\" Bessent said. Despite the days of market volatility since the tariffs were announced, Bessent said this was Mr. Trump's \"strategy all along.\"",

The Trump administration's imposition and walkback of tariffs has led to stock volatility and sparked worries of a global trade war and recession.",

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's April 2 announcement set out a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",

      "Two days after Mr. Trump said during a\u00a0meeting with Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs, he announced a 90-day pause on most of his planned tariffs and a lowering of the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10% \u2014 with the exception of China.",

      "The president previously said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.",

We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on April 6 on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",

      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street on Monday, April 7, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",

      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "China did not withdraw its tariffs and the ratcheting up continued, with Mr. Trump increasing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 104% and then and then 125% as China upped\u00a0its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%.",

      "Some nations are facing only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries are charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports face the baseline rate of 10%, while China-made products are now paying an import duty that has jumped to 104%\u00a0\u2014 the reciprocal tariffs combined with previously announced duties of 20% \u2014 after slapping its own tariffs on U.S. imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his April 2 remarks.",

The notable exception was China, with Mr. Trump saying that he's instead raising the tariff rate on the country's imports to 125%.",

      "Before he announced the pause, Asian nations were set to face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",

Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",

      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",

In response to that announcement, China said it would counter by placing the same duty \u2014 34% at the time \u2014 on U.S. imports, which prompted Mr. Trump to slap another 50% tariff on Chinese imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs be paid by U.S. companies that import products from China. Those companies are likely to pass on the cost of all or some of the import duties to American consumers, hiking prices on everything from iPhones to clothing made in China, according to experts.",
      "In an April 9 statement, China said called Mr. Trump's decision to add another 50% tariff as a \"mistake upon a mistake.\" It also called Mr. Trump's tariffs as an example of \"unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying.\"",
      "Wednesday's newest measures from Beijing include adding 11 American companies to a so-called \"unreliable entities\" list that would bar Chinese companies from selling them dual-use goods. Among the companies are American Photonics, and SYNEXXUS, both of whom work with the American military.",
      "So far, China has not appeared interested in bargaining. \"If the U.S. truly wants to resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation, it should adopt an attitude of equality, respect and mutual benefit,\" said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Lin Jian Wednesday.",
      "China now controls about 35% of the world's manufacturing, compared with 12% for the U.S.,\u00a0according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research. Beijing has also expanded its exports to other countries, particularly developing nations, as it seeks to lessen its reliance on the U.S., research group Onyx Strategic Insights noted in a recent report.",
      "\"China has spent the last five years Trump-proofing its economy \u2014 it has been working to nationalize supply chains, it has been working to penetrate different export markets, particularly in the developing world,\" Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. China is \"willing to endure the pain, thinking they can handle it longer than we can, and they might have a point.\"",
      "China was the third-largest export market for the U.S. in 2023, following Canada and Mexico, with $145 billion in goods shipped to the Asian nation that year, according to the U.S.-China Business Council. Oilseeds and grains are the top export that the U.S. sends to China, followed by oil and gas.",
      "EU also hitting back",
      "Separately, the European Union on Wednesday announced its own retaliatory measures against the U.S. The 27-country trading bloc announced tariffs on more than $22 billion in U.S. products, including soybeans, motorcycles and beauty products, according to AFP.",
      "\"The EU considers U.S. tariffs unjustified and damaging, causing economic harm to both sides, as well as the global economy,\"\u00a0 the European Commission said in a statement issued after EU member states approved the measures.",
      "The Trump administration has imposed a 25% tariffs on vehicles imported from the EU, along with a 20% reciprocal levy.",

As we focus on IT modernization and re-organize the agency to better serve the taxpayer, we are also in the midst of breaking down data silos that for too long have stood in the way of identifying waste, fraud, and abuse and bringing criminals to justice,\" a Treasury spokesperson said in a statement.",

      "On April 2, Mr. Trump announced what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. does trade with. Despite stock markets around the globe descending into tumult and economists warning for months that it will be consumers who pay the price for the levies, Mr. Trump has not backed down, insisting the measures will help the U.S. balance its trade deficit with other nations in the longer term.",
      "But in the near term, many Americans' adult beverages of choice, including European wines and Scotch whisky, are likely to come at more of a premium, according to industry insiders.",
      "Bartholomew Broadbent, who owns the Virginia-based wine wholesaler and importer Broadbent Selections, warned the impact on retail prices in the U.S. is going to be \"a lot worse than people think.\"",
      "French wines, as an example, will be subject to 20% tariffs under the measures announced by Mr. Trump. But Broadbent told CBS News the real-world price increase will be closer to 30%, because the cost of the tariff will be compounded at every stage of a bottle or crate's journey to a store shelf \u2014 with producers in France and other nations, along with importers like himself and then distributors and retailers all adding their own mark-ups.",
      "\"The price is going to have to go up,\" he said.",
      "In real terms, Broadbent estimated that the retail price on a bottle of wine that currently sells for $9.99 could go up to $13 or $14.",
      "Broadbent, whose company imports wines from 11 different countries and it also works with wineries in California, said more than 80% of his business will now face new tariffs. Wines from South Africa will be the most heavily impacted, he said, as the White House has hit the country with a steep 30% tariff.",
      "\"I don't see a single person who can benefit from this,\" Broadbent said. \"Even the wineries in America will suffer badly because they're all buying barrels and corks from Europe.\"",
      "The tariffs sent shockwaves through the global wine industry, with France's Bourgogne Wine Board (BIVB) warning the levies risked \"pushing our wines past a psychological price threshold.\"",
      "Bourgogne \u2014 or the Burgundy region as it's known in English \u2014 exported nearly 21 million bottles of wine to the U.S. in 2024, according to the BIVB, which agreed with the assessment that Mr. Trump's tariffs will have a negative impact on everyone, from French exporters and their distributor partners to American consumers.",
      "\"The industry deeply regrets this decision,\" the BIVB said in a press release",
      "The people who make, sell and enjoy Scotland's world renowned distilled spirits are also staring down the barrel of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last year alone, about 132 million bottles of Scotch whisky were imported into the U.S. market, according to the Scotch Whisky Association.",
      "The mood in Scotland is one of \"frustration and uncertainty,\" according to Drew McKenzie Smith, who founded and runs the Lindores Abbey Distillery just north of Edinburgh.",
      "McKenzie Smith estimated that the 10% baseline tariff Mr. Trump imposed on the U.K. would see the price of a bottle of his Scotch hiked by about the same amount for American consumers. So a bottle that currently costs $60 will soon jump to $66, be believes.",
      "While that \"may not sound severe,\" McKenzie Smith told CBS News, \"it still adds a meaningful burden \u2014 especially for smaller producers like us.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge said Friday that the Trump administration failed to comply with an order for it to provide information she requested about a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, including where he is currently located and whether they have taken any steps to facilitate his return to the United States.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said in a written order that the administration \"made no meaningful effort to comply\" with her directive to file a declaration addressing three questions related to the confinement of\u00a0Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u00a0at a Salvadoran supermax prison: his current physical location and custodial status; what stems the administration has taken to facilitate his return to the U.S.; and what steps they will take and when to facilitate his release.",
      "\"From this court's perspective, defendants' contention that they could not answer these basic questions absent some nonspecific 'vetting' that has yet to take place, provides no basis for their lack of compliance,\" she wrote.",
      "Xinis directed the administration to file daily declarations providing information in response to her queries. Her written order came after a hearing Friday.\u00a0 The Justice Department had told her in a filing earlier in the day that it was unable to provide the information she requested about Abrego Garcia and called a Friday morning deadline she set to provide the details \"impracticable.\"",
      "Xinis had\u00a0ordered the Trump administration to give her information about Abrego Garcia after the Supreme Court on Thursday reaffirmed her directive for the federal government to \"facilitate\" his release from Salvadoran custody.",
      "During the hearing Friday afternoon, Xinis asked Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, why he could not provide answers to her questions, including on Abrego Garcia's whereabouts.",
      "\"I'm not asking for state secrets,\" she said. \"I'm asking a very simple question: where is he?\"",
      "Ensign repeatedly said he was not given information that he could provide to the court, including Abrego Garica's custodial status and who had authority over him. Trump administration officials are still evaluating the Supreme Court's order, he said.",
      "Xinis repeatedly pressed Ensign about where Abrego Garcia is. He noted that his lawyers said Abrego Garcia's last known location is in El Salvador and acknowledged the government has not put forth information to the contrary.",
      "The judge called the lack of evidence from the Justice Department about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts \"extremely troubling.\"",
      "\"It behooves this case and how the system of justice works that the following be communicated to your clients: You are the officer of the court. You are the instrument to represent\" the government, Xinis said. She said that the record in the case currently shows that despite her directive to take steps to bring Agrego Garcia back to the U.S., \"your clients have done nothing to facilitate\" his return.",
      "\"I'm not sure what to take from the fact that the Supreme Court has spoken quite clearly and yet I can't get an answer today about what you've done, if anything, in the past,\" Xinis said.",
      "Ensign told the judge that the federal government \"intends to comply with the Supreme Court's order.\" He said that while the administration is prepared to answer her questions about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and what actions have been taken to secure his return, they may assert privileges.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's lawyer, said his lawyers and family have not had contact with Abrego Garcia, and accused the Trump administration of \"playing games with their own lawyers.\"",
      "\"They clearly didn't comply\" with the district court's order to turn over information about Abrego Garcia, he said.",
      "In the\u00a0filing to the court ahead of the hearing, Justice Department attorneys told the judge they \"are not in a position where they 'can' share any information requested by the court. That is the reality.\"",
      "\"Defendants received the order late in the evening last night. They are reviewing the order and actively evaluating next steps,\" they wrote. \"It is unreasonable and impracticable for defendants to reveal potential steps before those steps are reviewed, agreed upon, and vetted. Foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines, in part because it involves sensitive country-specific considerations wholly inappropriate for judicial review.\"",
      "The Justice Department lawyers said that the judge gave them an \"insufficient amount of time\" to review the Supreme Court's order and argued she has not yet provided clarity as to the scope of her initial directive, as the high court told her to do.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys opposed the government's request for more time to respond to the judge's directives and accused the Justice Department of continuing \"to delay, obfuscate, and flout court orders, while a man's life and safety is at risk.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children, was arrested and removed to El Salvador last month after Trump administration officials accused him of having ties to the MS-13 gang.\u00a0 His lawyers said he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "The 29-year-old is being confined at the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT, along with other migrants sent there by the administration as part of an agreement with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. Under the deal, the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees.",
      "But Abrego Garica's case emerged as a flashpoint in President Trump's immigration crackdown after a U.S. immigration official acknowledged in a court filing that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "In 2019, an immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia relief known as withholding of removal, which forbids the government from returning him to his home country of El Salvador because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "While the Trump administration admitted the error in sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the district court has no jurisdiction over the Salvadoran government and therefore cannot force it to release Abrego Garcia from its prison. Justice Department lawyers have said that the Salvadoran government has custody of Abrego Garcia, so he cannot be returned to the U.S. unless it releases him.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his wife filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland following his arrest and removal, alleging it violated federal immigration law. They sought an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "Xinis granted that request last week following a hearing and directed the government to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The dispute ended up before the Supreme Court, and Chief Justice John Roberts put that deadline on hold to allow the high court more time to consider the matter.",
      "Then, on Thursday, the Supreme Court unanimously agreed that the Trump administration had to \"facilitate\" the release of Abrego Garcia from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador\" \u2014 to provide Abrego Garcia with due process of law.",
      "But the Supreme Court also directed the district court to clarify its order, and specifically the directive that the government \"effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said. \"For its part, the government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",

      "Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jamee Comans ruled that the administration's determination that Khalil poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S. is \"facially reasonable\" and makes Khalil deportable.",

      "Comans held in abeyance the second deportation ground cited by the Trump administration: a claim that Khalil committed immigration fraud because he allegedly omitted information about his work history in his green card application.",
      "Comans made the determinations Friday afternoon, inside the courtroom of the privately operated U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Jena where Khalil has been held for weeks.",
      "Khalil, a vocal member of the protests at Columbia University over the war in Gaza, was arrested in early March by ICE, outside of his New York City apartment, where he lived with his pregnant U.S. citizen wife.",

      "Khalil noted that the judge had previously talked about \"due process and fundamental fairness,\" and the former Columbia student said those principles were not followed in his case.",
      "Khalil said the Trump administration shipped him \"1,000 miles away\" from his family. He concluded by telling the judge that the cases of other migrants detained here at the ICE facility in Jena, Louisiana should also be addressed with urgency.",
      "After the hearing, Marc van der Hout, an attorney for Khalil, said in a statement, \"Today, we saw our worst fears play out: Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent. This is not over, and our fight continues.\"",
      "\"If Mahmoud can be targeted in this way, simply for speaking out for Palestinians and exercising his constitutionally protected right to free speech, this can happen to anyone over any issue the Trump administration dislikes,\" van der Hout added.",
      "The government hasn't charged Khalil with any crime, but it has argued in immigration court that he should be stripped of his green card and deported on two civil immigration grounds.",
      "The Trump administration has invoked a rarely used provision of immigration law that allows the government to seek the deportation of noncitizens whose \"presence or activities\" are determined to \"have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "Faced with a deadline this week to provide evidence against Khalil, the Department of Homeland Security filed a memorandum by Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlining the foreign policy rationale.",
      "Rubio cited no specific evidence against Khalil, a 30-year-old legal permanent resident whose American citizen wife is in the late stages of pregnancy. But he said Khalil's presence in the country undermines \"U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\"",
      "The Trump government has separately alleged that Khalil committed immigration fraud by failing to disclose certain information in his green card application, including his work for the British Embassy in Beirut and the United Nations agency for Palestinian migrants and refugees.",
      "Khalil's attorneys harshly criticized Rubio's memo and the government's case against Khalil. They claim the government is violating Khalil's right to free speech.",
      "\"If the secretary of state claims the power to arrest, detain and deport someone, including a lawful permanent resident, simply because that person dissents from U.S. foreign policy, there are no limits. There's no beginning and no end to that kind of executive power,\" said Johnny Sinodis, an attorney for Khalil's immigration case, on Thursday.",
      "Khalil has separately sued the government over his arrest, detention and the effort to deport him. That case, in federal court in New Jersey, seeks an order that would require Khalil's release and the rescinding of the Rubio determination. It also asks a judge to prohibit the Trump administration from targeting noncitizens \"who engage in constitutionally protected expressive activity in the United States in support of Palestinian rights or critical of Israel.\"",

      "Karen Agnifilo and Avi Moskowitz, Mangione's attorneys, wrote in the motion that their client seeks relief because the attorney general prejudiced the grand jury pool and has corrupted the grand jury process by publicly issuing the death penalty direction to prosecutors via a press release.",
      "\"Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson \u2014 an innocent man and father of two young children \u2014 was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America. After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again,\" Bondi said in a statement earlier in April.",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:27:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Recent cuts eliminated a small, specialized workforce that sets the poverty standards determining who is eligible for Medicaid as well as assistance with food, home heating, child care, and more.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's firings at the Department of Health and Human Services included the entire office that sets federal poverty guidelines, which determine whether tens of millions of Americans are eligible for health programs such as Medicaid, food assistance, child care, and other services, former staff said.",
      "The small team, with technical data expertise, worked out of HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. Their dismissal mirrored others across HHS, which came without warning and left officials puzzled as to why they were \"RIF'ed\" \u2014 as in \"reduction in force,\" the bureaucratic language used to describe the firings.",
      "\"I suspect they RIF'ed offices that had the word 'data' or 'statistics' in them,\" said one of the laid-off employees, a social scientist whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because the person feared further recrimination. \"It was random, as far as we can tell.\"",
      "Among those fired was Kendall Swenson, who had led development of the poverty guidelines for many years and was considered the repository of knowledge on the issue, according to the social scientist and two academics who have worked with the HHS team.",
      "The sacking of the office could lead to cuts in assistance to low-income families next year unless the Trump administration restores the positions or moves its duties elsewhere, said Robin Ghertner, the fired director of the Division of Data and Technical Analysis, which had overseen the guidelines.",
      "The poverty guidelines are \"needed by many people and programs,\" said Timothy Smeeding, a professor emeritus of economics at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. \"If you're thinking of someone you fired who should be rehired, Swenson would be a no-brainer,\" he added.",
      "Under a 1981 appropriations bill, HHS is required annually to take Census Bureau poverty-line figures, adjust them for inflation, and create guidelines that agencies and states use to determine who is eligible for various types of help.",
      "There's a special sauce for creating the guidelines that includes adjustments and calculations, Ghertner said. Swenson and three other staff members would independently prepare the numbers and quality-check them together before they were issued each January.",
      "Everyone in Ghertner's office was told last week, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said.",
      "\"There's literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,\" he said. \"And because we're all locked out of our computers, we can't teach anyone how to calculate them.\"",
      "ASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "HHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired.",
      "\"These workers were told they couldn't come into their offices so there's no transfer of knowledge,\" said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. \"They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.\"",
      "HHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE \"as part of Secretary Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,\"\u00a0 spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. \"Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office\" and \"HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,\" she said in a written response to KFF Health News.",
      "After this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF'ed data analysis team, which had nine members. \"The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,\" he said. \"Eighty million people will not be affected.\"",
      "Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency's lobby.",
      "The group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee \"and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.\"",
      "Matt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues.",
      "ASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi's senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies.",
      "\"These HHS staffing cuts \u2014 20,000 \u2014 obviously they are completely nuts,\" Primus said. \"These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There's no rhyme or reasons to what they're doing.\"",
      "HHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said.",
      "And sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four.",
      "\"If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn't buy you the same,\" he said, \"but if the guidelines haven't increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.\"",
      "The 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.",
      "As of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility.",
      "Eligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level.",
      "One in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility.",
      "Former employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration's objectives. \"We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,\" the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" rubric. \"Even if it didn't align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.\"",

      "A Senate committee heard from several experts Thursday on setting a year-round time standard instead of switching back and forth with daylight saving time. President Trump recently called it a \"50/50 issue,\" but he previously vowed to get rid of daylight saving.",
      "At the hearing, the committee's chairman, Sen. Ted Cruz, said there is a general consensus among his colleagues that the system of switching the clocks needs to be changed, but he said there is disagreement about whether to adopt universal standard time or daylight saving time.",
      "\"I personally struggle with the two choices here, because it's a question of what do you care about more: sunshine and joy and fun and money, or health, mental health, physical health,\" said Cruz, a Republican from Texas. \"And the honest answer for most people, gosh, I care about all that stuff.\"",
      "Cruz said an alternative has been discussed to pick daylight saving time, but letting states opt out. Arizona and Hawaii current opt out of changing the clock. But others said in Thursday's hearing that having different standards for different states could cause widespread confusion.",
      "The Senate Commerce Committee hearing notice did not set a preference for daylight saving time or standard time, but instead said it would focus on \"various issues around whether the country should continue 'springing forward' and 'falling back' each year with time.\"",
      "Daylight saving time begins in March, when clocks are moved forward an hour, and ends in October, when the clocks go back to standard time.",
      "The twice-yearly time changes are\u00a0generally unpopular\u00a0among Americans, with 63% saying they\u00a0would like to eliminate\u00a0them completely, compared to just 16% who said they would not, according to an Economist/YouGov poll in November 2021.",
      "\"People across our country are tired of the constant cycle of falling back and springing forward,\" Democratic Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware said, calling it time for a \"thoughtful solution\" across the country.",
      "\"The important thing is that we land of something consistent and make smart investments to keep people safe,\" she said.",
      "\"Time is always complicated and the system we have is complicated, but it's complicated because it's a human creation,\" said Scott Yates, the founder of the Lock the Clock movement, which supports getting rid of twice-yearly time changes.",
      "\"The sun moving around the earth doesn't actually have anything to do with time,\" Yates said. \"We need this system, but this system has this bug right now, and the bug is daylight saving time, the switching of the clocks. And so if we have a little bit of time, a couple of years, so the individual states can address all of these complexities and make those decisions, then we will be able to get rid of this bug permanently. It is something we have been stuck with since World War I, and this is our opportunity to finally fix it.\"",
      "A 2020\u00a0commentary\u00a0for the journal JAMA Neurology found evidence linking the annual transition to daylight saving time to\u00a0increased strokes,\u00a0heart attacks\u00a0and\u00a0teen sleep deprivation.",
      "The Senate in 2022 passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act to make daylight saving time permanent, but the bill never went anywhere in the House. The 2022 bill had 17 cosponsors from both parties and was spearheaded by then-Sen. Marco Rubio, who is now the Secretary of State in the Trump administration.",
      "President Trump has given a range of comments about his views. He said in March that it's a \"50/50 issue,\" saying \"it's hard to get excited about it. I assume people would like to have more light later, but some people want to have more light earlier because they don't want to take their kids to school in the dark.\"",
      "But on Friday, after the latest hearing, he posted on social media: \"The House and Senate should push hard for more Daylight at the end of a day. Very popular and, most importantly, no more changing of the clocks, a big inconvenience and, for our government, A VERY COSTLY EVENT!!!\"",
      "In December, he said the \"Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't!\"",
      "Mr. Trump in the past had supported making daylight saving time\u00a0permanent \u2014 that is, keeping clocks shifted one hour ahead, which happens in the spring. His\u00a0December comment\u00a0called for daylight saving time to be eliminated.",
      "In addition to Yates, testifying Thursday was Jay Karen, chief executive officer of the National Golf Course Owners Association; Karin Johnson, practicing physician and professor of neurology at UMass Chan School of Medicine Baystate, on behalf of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine; and David Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 01:12:00 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. and Russian intelligence agencies negotiated an agreement to free American Ksenia Karelina in exchange for a Russian detainee.",
    "story": [
      "Russia released Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason in August last year, in a new prison swap on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed her release in a social media post early Thursday, but offered no information about the terms of her release.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported\u00a0Karelina's release, saying she was freed in a swap arranged by the two countries' intelligence agencies, and a CIA official later told CBS News that the agency had played a central role in the deal on behalf of the U.S. government.",
      "\"American Ksenia Karelina is on a plane back home to the United States,\" Rubio said in his post. \"She was wrongfully detained by Russia for over a year and President Trump secured her release.\"",
      "The plane landed around 11 p.m. EDT at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where she was greeted by several people including her boyfriend, professional boxer Chris van Heerden. In a touching moment, Karelina and van Heerden had a long embrace.",
      "In a statement first published by the Journal and later provided to CBS News, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said, \"President Trump brought home another wrongfully detained American from Russia,\" and added his praise for \"the CIA officers who worked tirelessly to support this effort\" and for the United Arab Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which he said had enabled the exchange. The swap of the two detainees was carried out in Abu Dhabi.",
      "Ratcliffe was directly involved in the negotiations, which he conducted with an unnamed senior Russian intelligence official, the CIA said.",
      "The top level communication indicates a deepening of efforts by the Trump administration to improve ties with Moscow. Mr. Trump has been pushing both Russia and Ukraine to negotiate a peace agreement to end the three-year war sparked by Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of its neighbor.",
      "In exchange for Karelina, who lives in California, the CIA official confirmed that the U.S. had freed Arthur Petrov, a German-Russian national arrested in Cyprus 2023 at the request of U.S. authorities. According to the Journal, he was being held on allegations of exporting sensitive microelectronics.",
      "\"Much of the swap was negotiated by the U.S. government, with CIA playing a key role engaging with Russian intelligence,\" a CIA spokesperson said Thursday, adding, \"The exchange shows the importance of keeping lines of communication open with Russia, despite the deep challenges in our bilateral relationship.\"",
      "Karelina was sentenced to 12 years in a Russian penal colony after pleading guilty to treason. She was arrested while on visit to Russia for donating about $51 to an American-based humanitarian group that was helping Ukrainians impacted by the war, according to Russian state media.",
      "Her lawyers said she acknowledged transferring the funds, though she did not admit she intentionally directed them to organizations that might have used the money for actions against Russia. She didn't expect that her donation would end up supporting anti-Russian activities, according to her lawyers.",
      "Van Heerden\u00a0told CBS News last year that she had made the small donation in 2022, \"exercising her First Amendment rights,\" adding that \"she has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Van Heerden said he was uneasy about Karelina's decision to return to Russia for a visit, given the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, but he said she \"had no worry in the world,\" and that she had assured him it would be safe since she was entering the country as a dual American-Russian citizen.",
      "\"She wanted to go home. She made it very clear that she wanted to go home,\" Van Heerden told Gayle King on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Wanting to fulfill her wish to visit home, Van Heerden said he bought her a plane ticket as a birthday gift, and the pair first traveled together to Istanbul. He had originally intended to travel with her to Russia from there, but he didn't feel comfortable, so she traveled alone to Russia, and he returned to Los Angeles.",
      "Russia imprisoned a number of Americans as tension with Washington soared amid the build up to, and eventually the full-scale war in Ukraine. Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich\u00a0and teacher\u00a0Marc Fogel\u00a0were all designated wrongfully detained like Karelina and freed in previous prisoner swaps with Moscow.",
      "Among the U.S. nationals still jailed in Russia is U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Gordon Black, whose three-year, nine-month prison sentence for robbing and threatening his Russian girlfriend was reduced earlier this week by seven months by a Russian court.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-maryland-man-deported-to-el-salvador/",
    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 23:21:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal immigration official acknowledged last week that the removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man, to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of a Maryland man mistakenly deported from custody in El Salvador, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court.",
      "In an unsigned decision, the high court acknowledged that a late Monday deadline set by the district court judge to secure the return to the U.S. of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, and paused by Chief Justice John Roberts had already passed, effectively granting in part the emergency relief sought by the Trump administration.",
      "But the court said that the district court's order \"properly requires the government to 'facilitate'\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and to \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "The Supreme Court went on to say that the intended scope of the term \"effectuate\" in the lower court's decision is unclear and may exceed its authority. The high court directed the district court to provide more clarification with the case sent back for further proceedings.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said in an unsigned opinion. \"For its part, the Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis issued an order Thursday evening following the Supreme Court's decision directing the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia \"as soon as possible.\"",
      "She gave the Department of Justice until 9:30 a.m. Friday to detail where Abrego Garcia is and the plans to bring him back to the U.S.",
      "There were no noted dissents, and the three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, noted their respect for the court's disposition of the application. Sotomayor said in a statement joined by Kagan and Jackson that there is agreement among the justices \"that the proper remedy is to provide Abrego Garcia with all the process to which he would have been entitled had he not been unlawfully removed to El Salvador.\"",
      "\"As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the President to conduct foreign affairs,\" a DOJ spokesperson said Thursday. \"By directly noting the deference owed to the Executive Branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the President's authority to conduct foreign policy.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked the Trump administration in a court filing to facilitate his release from the notorious Salvadoran supermax prison known as CECOT Thursday evening and to dispatch a plane to retrieve him. They cited the \"grave risk to his safety in El Salvador.\"",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in after a federal district judge on Friday ordered it to take immediate action to return Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. The 29-year-old Salvadoran national was arrested by immigration authorities on March 15 and was among the more than 200 people sent on deportation flights to El Salvador last month.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case sparked backlash after a federal immigration official acknowledged in a court filing last week that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old and was arrested in 2019, according to court documents. During immigration proceedings, the Department of Homeland Security claimed that Abrego Garcia was a member of the gang MS-13, citing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie he was wearing and allegations from a confidential informant who said he belonged to a branch of MS-13 that operates on Long Island, New York, court records show.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he has never lived on Long Island and has no affiliation with MS-13. They also said he has no criminal history and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "An immigration judge detained Abrego Garcia after denying a request for release on bond, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board. But he was ultimately granted withholding of removal to El Salvador, a legal status that prohibits the government from returning him to his home country because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from custody following that decision and has lived for six years in Maryland with his wife and their children. He had regular check-ins with immigration authorities, according to court filings, but was arrested on March 12 after he was stopped by immigration agents while driving with his son in the back seat. Abrego Garcia was taken into custody and transported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Baltimore, Louisiana and Texas before he was flown to El Salvador, according to legal filings.",
      "After Abrego Garcia was sent to the Salvarodan prison last month, he and his wife, a U.S. citizen, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland alleging his removal violated federal immigration law and seeking an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted that request following a hearing Friday and directed the government to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to halt that order, and while its request was pending, asked the Supreme Court to intervene. The 4th Circuit then declined to pause the district court's decision.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the lower court order \"sets the United States up for failure\" because it interfered with President Trump's ability to conduct foreign diplomacy and set a tight timeline for compliance. He wrote that the U.S. cannot force the release of Abrego Garcia because he is now in the custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "\"The United States does not control the sovereign nation of El Salvador, nor can it compel El Salvador to follow a federal judge's bidding,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "Sotomayor warned in her statement that the government's argument \"implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene.\"",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia called his case \"one of one,\" and argued in court papers that requiring the government to facilitate their client's return is \"not novel,\" because the district court's order just requires the Trump administration to correct its own error.",
      "\"The executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets, deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders, and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny,\" they wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia's legal team called the government's mistake in removing him \"Kafka-esque,\" and noted that he has lived in the U.S. for several years without any issues.",
      "\"The government offers no evidence that he has become a threat overnight,\" they wrote.",
      "Migrants removed from the U.S. are being housed in CECOT as a result of a temporary agreement the Trump administration reached with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, under which the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees for a year.",
      "Citing this arrangement, Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued that the U.S. government \"functionally controls Abrego Garcia's detention \u2014 it has simply contracted with El Salvador to be the jailer.\"",
      "Lower courts also said that the government has control over Abrego Garcia, since he is being temporarily housed in CECOT at the Trump administration's request.",
      "\"The government's claim that it can remove an individual from the United States pursuant to such an agreement and thereby lose the ability to reclaim that individual and return him to the country for process (or for any other purpose) cannot stand,\" Judge Stephanie Thacker, who sits on the 4th Circuit, wrote in an opinion. She added that \"the government's actions in this case most assuredly violated the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\"",
      "Thacker, who was joined by Judge Robert King, wrote that \"the government cannot escape its responsibility to return Abrego Garcia to the United States by claiming it now lacks authority to control El Salvador.\"",
      "While the Trump administration has acknowledged that it inadvertently sent Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the federal courts do not have the power to demand his return since he's no longer in U.S. custody. Administration officials have also claimed that he is an MS-13 \"leader,\" though they have not produced evidence to support the allegations.",
      "During last week's hearing before Xinis, Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni repeatedly struggled to answer the judge's questions but said he wasn't given sufficient information by the administration.",
      "\"The facts are conceded, plaintiff Abrego Garcia should not have been removed,\" Reuveni said.",
      "When questioned about why the government is not able to return Abrego Garcia, Reuveni said he \"asked the government the same question\" and did not receive an answer. The Justice Department lawyer said multiple times he was \"frustrated\" with the government's lack of cooperation in the case.",
      "Following Friday's argument, Reuveni was placed on administrative leave, and Sauer said in a filing that his statements were \"inappropriate\" and \"do not reflect the position of the United States.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News about Reuveni's employment status, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, \"At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.\"",

    "summary": "In the memo, which was obtained by CBS News, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote that Mahmoud Khalil's role in Columbia's protests is in conflict with American foreign policy objectives\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "Faced with a deadline to provide evidence in its deportation case against activist Mahmoud Khalil, lawyers for the federal government instead filed a memorandum by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to a Louisiana immigration court.",
      "In the memo, which was obtained by CBS News, Rubio wrote that Khalil's role in protests on the campus of Columbia University is in conflict with American foreign policy objectives. Rubio did not cite specific evidence against Khalil. He stated that Khalil is deportable under a little-known statute in federal immigration law that provides the government is entitled to deport noncitizens whose presence in the U.S. damages national foreign policy interests.",
      "Rubio argued that the presence of Khalil, a 30-year-old legal permanent resident, undermines \"U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\"",
      "Khalil was a prominent voice in the spring 2024 pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, where he earned a master's degree from the School of International and Public Affairs in December 2024. He was detained by federal immigration authorities at his university-owned apartment as his pregnant wife looked on. He was moved from New York to a detention center in New Jersey before being flown to a remote facility in Jena, Louisiana.",
      "The government claims that Khalil has supported Hamas, and can be deported if it is determined his presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S., citing alleged support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. To date, CBS News has not found evidence that Khalil has said he supports Hamas.",
      "Assistant chief immigration Judge Jamee Comans on Tuesday said she would terminate the case unless the government showed evidence supporting the removal of the former Columbia student. Khalil's attorney Marc Van Der Hout said at the hearing that he had \"not received a single document\" of evidence from the government.",
      "\"I'd like to see the evidence,\" Comans said, demanding that the government make a filing within 24 hours.",
      "In response, the Department of Homeland Security submitted the two-page memo from Rubio, which includes references to Khalil and one other lawful permanent resident whose name was redacted.",
      "Rubio wrote that they should be removed from the country because their \"presence or activities would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\"",
      "\"The foreign policy of the United States champions core American interests and American citizens,\" he continued, \"and condoning anti-Semitic conduct and disruptive protests in the United States would severely undermine that significant foreign policy objective.\"",
      "Rubio pointed to Khalil's participation in what he descirbed as \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities,\" which he said creates a \"hostile environment for Jewish students,\" as well as \"unlawful activity\" during those protests.",
      "\"The government can't just operate on hidden law based on one executive official's say so,\" said Baher Azmy, Legal Director of the Center of Constitutional Rights during a press call about Khalil on Thursday. \"Does anyone here know what conduct they would have to engage in that would trigger an adverse foreign policy interest to The United States? No one does. No one can. Which is what's so dangerous about this law.\"",
      "Comans has set a removability hearing for Khalil on Friday at 1 p.m., at which she could determine whether sufficient evidence has been provided to support the continuation of his immigration case.",
      "The government had previously said Khalil should be expelled for what it's described as \"material support\" for the militant group Hamas via his role in campus protests against Israel.",
      "Khalil's attorneys, who have also sued the government on his behalf, lambasted the government, saying the government was depriving him of his right to free speech.",
      "\"After a month of hiding the ball since Mahmoud's late-night unjust arrest in New York and taking him away to a remote detention center in Louisiana, immigration authorities have finally admitted that they have no case whatsoever against him,\" said Van Der Hout. \"Instead, the government is clearly going after Mahmoud and persecuting him for exercising his First Amendment rights.\"",
      "After Khalil's arrest, President Trump said it was just the first \"of many to come.\" His statement heralded a crackdown on students and alleged \"agitators\" who have protested against Israel.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/save-act-voter-registration-citizenship-married-women-name-change/",
    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The SAVE Act could change voter registration requirements for millions of people. Here's how.",
    "story": [
      "A claim circulating on social media suggests that married people who changed their last name will face difficulties when trying to vote under the proposed Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.",
      "Experts say the bill, which\u00a0passed in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, April 10, would not explicitly prevent these voters from casting a ballot, but it could create barriers to registration by requiring them to show additional documentation.",
      "The measure now heads to the Senate. If it passes in the Senate and is\u00a0signed into law, the act would amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which requires states\u00a0to offer voter registration when obtaining a driver's license, to mandate documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration.",
      "This means that common forms of ID used for voter registration, including driver's licenses, would no longer be accepted as they are not generally considered proof of citizenship. Instead, voters would have to present documents such as a U.S. passport, a birth certificate, or naturalization paperwork to register.",
      "The Center for American Progress analysis estimated as many as 69 million have taken their spouse's name but do not have a matching birth certificate. \"The fate of those 69 million women are basically up in the air, the way the bill is written,\" said Greta Bedekovics, associate director of democracy policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy and advocacy group.",
      "Opponents argue that the law could also make voting more difficult for military and rural voters by upending both mail-in and online voter registration. Bedekovic said it would make an in-person trip to the election office the only \"viable way for Americans across the country to register to vote,\" adding that rural voters are less likely to have a passport and may have to travel hours to obtain and submit documents.",
      "According to Congress.gov, the bill also \"establishes criminal penalties\" for registering someone who does not have the right documents to vote.",
      "Eliza Sweren-Becker, senior counsel in the Brennan Center's Voting Rights and Elections Program, noted that the bill \"does not specify what extra documents\" married individuals would need to produce, adding that \"election officials, who would face legal risks under the bill, would be hesitant to register women whose documentation name does not match their current name.\"",
      "\"This in-person 'show your papers' requirement would keep many eligible voters out of the voting booth \u2014 beyond the millions who already lack ready access to their citizenship documents \u2014 and cause chaos for election administration,\" said Sweren-Becker.",
      "As of January 2025, eight states require proof of citizenship to register to vote, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Americans widely support both voter ID requirements and proof of citizenship. A\u00a02024 Gallup survey found more than 4 in 5 respondents supported proof of citizenship requirements for first-time voters.",
      "Supporters of the bill, including U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, a Republican from Pennsylvania, argue that it is necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting.",
      "However,\u00a0noncitizen voting is already illegal and rare. In a study following the 2016 election, the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice found just 30 suspected cases of noncitizen voting out of 23.5 million votes cast in the 42 jurisdictions reviewed.",
      "A 2023 Pew Research survey found\u00a0that about 80% of women married to men in the U.S. take their husband's last name. Under the SAVE Act, if their voter registration name differs from the name on their birth certificate or passport, they may need to show additional documents.",
      "If the SAVE Act were to become law, Bedekovics said married women who have changed their names should obtain certified copies of all marriage certificates, locate their birth certificates, and keep any change-of-name documentation on hand for any updates to their voter registration.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:14:04 -0400",
    "summary": "The vote was initially delayed amid conservatives' concerns about the level of spending cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday adopted a budget blueprint for President Trump's agenda after Republican leaders scrambled to convince GOP holdouts who want deeper spending cuts to back it.",
      "The resolution was adopted in a 216-214 vote, with two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana \u2014 joining all Democrats to vote against it.",
      "About a dozen House conservatives ultimately flipped their opposition after receiving assurances from leaders that the Senate would pursue $1.5 trillion in savings, at a minimum.",
      "\"Our two chambers are directly aligned,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said before the vote. \"We're committed to finding at least $1.5 trillion in savings for the American people while also preserving our essential programs.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, echoed that the Senate is \"aligned with the House in terms of what their budget resolution outlined in terms of savings.\"",
      "\"The speaker talked about $1.5 trillion dollars. We have a lot of United States senators who believe that is a minimum,\" Thune said.",
      "The lower chamber was set to vote Wednesday evening on the budget resolution but punted after several House conservatives resisted increasing pressure from Mr. Trump to accept the blueprint that would open the door to implementing his border security, defense, energy priorities and extending expiring tax cuts.",
      "Approving the budget plan in both chambers is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass Mr. Trump's agenda with a simple majority. Going that route allows Republicans, who have control of the House and Senate, to pass the measure without any support from Democrats.",
      "The House and Senate worked on separate blueprints earlier this year but more recently reached a compromise resolution, which the Senate adopted early Saturday morning. Republican leaders in the House worked to unite their divided party behind the budget plan this week before Congress leaves town for a two-week recess.",
      "The Senate set much lower minimum floors for spending cuts at just about $4 billion, though committees could find far more. The compromise resolution also allows for the House to slash at least $1.5 trillion in spending.",
      "The Senate also wants to account for tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term with a tactic known as \"current policy baseline,\" which assumes that continuing expiring policies will cost nothing. Under that baseline, the nearly $4 trillion it would cost to extend the 2017 tax cuts would not be counted, further frustrating House conservatives.",
      "Johnson said House and Senate committees would be working in a \"collaborative fashion\" over the two-week recess to find savings.",
      "Before backing the resolution, House conservatives wanted assurances from the Senate that there will be deeper spending cuts, which sent leadership scrambling to find another compromise.",
      "\"We just don't trust the Senate,\" Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, told reporters Wednesday night after fiscal hawks huddled with Johnson for more than hour as the vote was delayed. \"We all campaign on spending cuts, but again and again, that doesn't happen. And when the Senate sent over something that said $4 billion is their floor, that was unacceptable to a lot of us.\"",
      "Burlison was among those who changed their minds and voted in favor of the resolution. Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said he and other holdouts were moved to support the resolution by a White House commitment to making \"significant cuts,\" Johnson's \"firm commitment\" to maintain House Republicans' framework of tying tax cuts to spending cuts and Thune's \"strong statement\" promising at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts.",
      "Massie, one of the two Republicans who held firm on his \"no\" vote, called it \"a framework for financial collapse.\"",
      "\"I don't believe they're going to make any cuts of any consequence. Now they may change spending, reduce spending here, and increase spending there, but overall, the money spent next year is going to be more than the money spent this year,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump increased pressure on House Republicans in recent days to swallow the blueprint, telling holdouts on Tuesday night, \"close your eyes and get there.\" He added that individual lawmakers may not get \"every little ounce\" of what they want in the legislation.",
      "\"It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner.",
      "Democrats have railed against the proposed cuts, arguing the Republican plan will lead to massive cuts in entitlement programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.",
      "\"The budget resolution that passed the House today will set in motion some of the most extreme cuts to health care, nutritional assistance and the things that matter to everyday Americans in our nation's nearly 250-year history,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Thursday. \"It's a disgrace.\"",

      "\"The evidence that we have in black and white is a company and leadership that is willing to do anything, anything, work with America's chief competitor, work with our chief adversary,\" Hawley said.",
      "Hawley sent a letter to Zuckerberg Thursday requesting his testimony before the subcommittee, writing, \"The American people deserve to know the truth about your company.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams began working at Meta, then known as Facebook, as the director of Global Public Policy in 2011. In her almost seven years with the company, Wynn-Williams told the panel she witnessed the company provide \"custom built censorship tools\" for the Chinese Communist Party. She said a Chinese dissident living in the United States was removed from Facebook in 2017 after pressure from Chinese officials. Facebook said at the time it took action against the regime critic, Guo Wengui, for sharing someone else's personal information.",
      "Wynn-Williams described the use of a \"virality counter\" that flagged posts with over 10,000 views for review by a \"chief editor,\" which Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called \"an Orwellian censor.\" These \"virality counters\" were used not only in Mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan, according to Wynn-Williams's testimony.",

DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that sent shockwaves through the American technology industry earlier this year when its AI model was shown to be competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.",
      "In a statement last year on Llama, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote, \"The alleged role of a single and outdated version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing over 1T to surpass the US technologically, and Chinese tech companies are releasing their own open AI models as fast, or faster, than US ones.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams encouraged senators to continue investigating Meta's role in the development of artificial intelligence in China, as they continue their probe into the social media company founded by Zuckerberg.",

Routh aimed his rifle at an agent, who opened fire, which led Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing, they said.",
      "Uthmeier, a Republican, criticized the Biden administration, accusing it of trying to \"frustrate our efforts\" and \"block\" his office's investigation. He lauded FBI director Kash Patel and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi for being willing to \"work together to pursue justice.\"",
      "Routh is jailed on federal charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a federal officer, being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number.",
      "He is due in court on the federal charges in September. The lag between his arrest and his next court date was granted to give his attorneys time to review hundreds of hours of footage from police body cameras and surveillance cameras, and to pore over material from Routh's 17 cellphones and other electronic devices.",
      "On Tuesday, the government submitted new evidence against Routh, alleging that in March and April 2024, Routh spent over a week in West Palm Beach, \"engaging in apparent reconnaissance for his assassination attempt.\"",
      "\"Routh's acidity is undeniably necessary context for the jury to understand the significance of Routh's conduct on September 15 at Trump International because it shows his planning for what happened that day and his familiarity with locations he revisited on and leading up to September 15, including the South Bay area where he camped in the weeks beforehand, and Southern Boulevard, the main road from South Bay to Trump International,\" the government wrote in the court documents.",

      "Ambassador Brink has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "One senior U.S. official told CBS that her resignation stems from an unusual mix of personal and policy concerns, including the recent USAID layoffs. Brink is serving in a war zone far from her family, since Kyiv is designated as an unaccompanied post, where officers serve without bringing their families with them.",

Vice President JD Vance also admonished Zelensky: \"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting?\"",

That intelligence support resumed once Ukraine agreed to go along with the Trump administration's outreach to Putin.

      "\"We had been discussing all kinds of options, Sir,\" Greer said.",
      "\"There was no strategy. There was no plan,\" Horsford said, adding that Mr. Trump \"put our economy in disarray and near collapse.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued the tariffs were a \"negotiating strategy.\"",

      "Nearly half of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's staff working on developmental disabilities and birth defects was laid off this month, multiple officials tell CBS News, wiping out teams working on research about adults with cognitive disabilities and\u00a0sickle cell disease.",
      "Work likely to be halted by the cuts includes the collection of data for studying Americans with sickle cell, a painful blood disorder that predominantly affects Black families, as well as supporting testing for its more dangerous complications.",
      "\"If it is not restored, it will disrupt life-saving public health programs, halt critical research, and increase preventable hospitalizations, complications, and deaths. Its elimination runs counter to the Administration's stated commitment to addressing chronic disease,\" said Dr. Belinda Avalos, president of the American Society of Hematology, in a statement this week.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed openness to restoring some programs he gutted, like the CDC's lead poisoning experts, though for now they have yet to be reinstated.",
      "\"HHS is following the Administration's guidance and taking a careful look at all divisions to see where there is overlap that could be streamlined to support the President's broader efforts to restructure the federal government. This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard,\" HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano said in a statement.",
      "In addition to the blood disorders division, Kennedy's layoffs wiped out the entire leadership team atop CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities that housed it. Support staff for the center, as well as its Disability and Health Promotion Branch, were also cut.",
      "That branch had been responsible for a federal database tracking state-level rates of adults with disabilities. Researchers and health authorities rely on the data to target resources where they're needed most, and to study patterns and trends in disabilities.",
      "A now-stalled upcoming release of data had been expected to help shed light on a recent increase in cognitive disability among younger adults, an official said.",
      "\"There seems to be a step back to see developmental disabilities, like autism, being only in childhood. The branch provided key public health expertise for disability in adulthood, where people spend most of their lives,\" said a current CDC official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "It has also ended work on the congressionally mandated Early Hearing Detection and Intervention programs, which fund states and other efforts to screen and diagnose children's hearing issues.",
      "Nearly all U.S. newborns are now screened for hearing loss thanks in part to the program, according to the center's data, up from less than half of newborns 25 years ago. States had also been working with the branch on efforts to increase\u00a0 follow-up rates.",
      "Also eliminated in the cuts were CDC staff overseeing a partnership with the Special Olympics \u2014 an organization founded by Kennedy's aunt, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, and now chaired by his cousin, Timothy Shriver. The CDC program had provided health screenings and collected data on people with intellectual disabilities.",
      "Only a handful of researchers remain on the job in the center, in the agency's Child and Development and Disability Branch and Division of Birth Defects and Infant Disorders.",
      "This includes researchers working on the CDC's autism monitoring network, which produce figures that Kennedy has often cited as evidence that rates of autism are on the rise.",
      "Many of those remaining staff are expected to be merged into Kennedy's new Administration for a Healthy America agency, two officials said, along with staff from the CDC's centers focused on chronic disease and drug overdoses.",

    "story": [
      "In what could be a key 2025 bellwether, Virginia's race for governor will also make history, all but guaranteeing the Commonwealth's first female governor. Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former congresswoman and CIA officer, will face Republican Lt. Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, a Marine veteran, after both state parties confirmed their nominees in recent days.",
      "One of the only competitive races of the year, the Virginia gubernatorial contest will be closely watched by both parties \u2014 and is often treated as a referendum on the president's party. Historically, Virginia has voted for a governor of the opposite political party, every time a new president has been elected since 1977.",
      "The race is already breaking state records for fundraising, with Earle-Sears raising more than $3 million from January to March and Spanberger raising around $6.7 million during the same period, according to the campaigns.",
      "In an interview with \"America Decides,\" Spanberger told CBS News she believes national issues will weigh heavily on the race, from the Trump administration's mass layoffs of federal employees, more than 144,000 of whom live in Virginia, as well as what she called an \"antagonistic trade war.\"",
      "\"All of this impacts Virginia, and the stakes of this election reflect that,\" said Spanberger.",
      "When asked whether Earle-Sears supports President Trump's tariff policy, her campaign deflected but said in a statement, \"After leftists like Joe Biden and Abigail Spanberger devastated our economy and standing in the world\u2014President Trump is doing the work to put America first again.\"",
      "Earle-Sears has attacked Spanberger for her votes in Congress supporting Biden administration policies including the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in 2022 with no Republican support. Earle-Sears argues it has contributed to inflation.",
      "\"I think it's a ridiculous assertion given that my opponent has been eager to claim credit for some of the funding that came through some of those federal dollars to Virginia's Commonwealth,\" Spanberger told CBS News. \"But, the reality is that my opponent is endeavoring to distract, because she's not talking about the fact that we've seen an absolute tanking of the stock market because of Donald Trump's actions.\"",
      "While the economy is a top issue for Virginians and both candidates, advocates are also hoping gun safety mobilizes voters.",
      "Spanberger is set to receive the endorsement of Everytown for Gun Safety Thursday, the group first told CBS News. Everytown, established by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is also contributing $1 million to the race, which will include organizing efforts and political ads.",
      "Spanberger herself became a volunteer for pro-gun control group Moms Demand Action after leaving the CIA.",
      "\"Abigail Spanberger understands that common-sense laws to keep guns out of dangerous hands are crucial to ensuring public safety,\" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said of the endorsement.",
      "Everytown also points to their success at the state legislative level in 2023 when nine gun safety volunteers won races and helped flip the House of Delegates, the lower house of Virginia's legislature, to Democratic control.",
      "The group says internal polling from that year revealed it's a top three issue for Virginia voters in battleground districts across Northern Virginia, Richmond and Hampton Roads.",
      "Youngkin vetoed an assault weapons ban and other gun control bills that passed the state legislature last year.",
      "He did sign two other gun measures, including one that bans auto sears, a device that converts semi-automatic handguns into automatic weapons. He also signed \"Lucia's Law,\" making it a crime for parents who allow children deemed as threats to access firearms.",
      "Earle-Sears has supported the governor's vetoes.",
      "In 2021, Earle-Sears became the first Black woman ever elected to statewide office in Virginia. She will have to appeal to moderates and independent voters in the blue-leaning state but has given mixed messages on her support for Mr. Trump in recent years.",
      "In 2020, she co-chaired the group \"Black Americans to re-elect President Trump,\" but in 2022, following the midterms, she told FOX Business it was \"time to move on.\"",
      "\"A true leader understands when they have become a liability,\" she said during the interview. \"A true leader understands when it's time to step off the stage.\"",
      "She went on to vote for Mr. Trump in 2024. A source close to the campaign says she sees the president as a federal partner. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump offers Earle-Sears an endorsement given the high stakes of this year's few marquee races.",
      "While Mr. Trump made inroads in Virginia during the 2024 presidential election, the state comfortably went for Vice President Kamala Harris in November.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department seeks to drop its criminal case against a Virginia man accused of being the \"East Coast leader\" of the MS-13 gang, weeks after Attorney General Pam Bondi announced his arrest in a nationally televised press conference last month.",
      "Bondi referred to Henrry Villatoro Santos as \"one of the top members and head of the East Coast\" of the violent MS-13 gang during a March 27 news conference in Manassas, Virginia. She also accused Villatoro Santos of being responsible for \"very violent crimes, anything you can associate with MS-13. He was the leader over it \u2014 all of the violent crimes.\"",
      "In a court filing Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia asked a judge \"to dismiss without prejudice the criminal complaint presently pending against the defendant.\" When asked why the government was moving to drop the case, a spokesperson for Bondi responded with a clip of Bondi saying on March 27 that Villatoro Santos \"won't be in this country much longer.\"",
      "Two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News the department is likely to seek to deport Villatoro Santos.",

Glenn Youngkin and others of creating a media circus with \"breathless pronouncements\" about the allegations against Villatoro Santos.",
      "\"The danger of Mr. Villatoro Santos being unlawfully deported by ICE without due process and removed to El Salvador, where he would almost certainly be immediately detained at one of the worst prisons in the world without any right to contest his removal, is substantial, both in light of the Government's recent actions and the very public pronouncements in this particular case,\" his attorneys wrote in Wednesday's filing, citing the ongoing legal battle concerning alleged Venezuelan gang members who were sent to a Salvadoran prison, seemingly without due process.",
      "His attorneys said they feared the same fate would befall their client if the judge agreed to drop the case immediately.",

The charging documents said, \"FBI agents and (task force officers) also observed indicia of MS-13 association in the garage bedroom\" of Villatoro Santos' home. He was charged with one count of unlawful possession of a firearm and was ordered detained by a magistrate judge, pending future hearings.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on a Republican budget plan, lacking enough GOP support to get it over the finish line on Wednesday.",
      "Several House Republicans have resisted increasing pressure from President Trump to swallow a blueprint that's key to extending his tax cuts, which are set to expire this year.",
      "The resolution's passage was in peril heading into the planned vote, making it a gamble for Johnson, who huddled with conservatives off the House floor as the preceding vote was held open for more than an hour while he tried to flip the holdouts. It's the latest setback for Johnson and creates further uncertainty about the future of Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said the vote could be rescheduled for Thursday morning.",
      "At a fundraiser for House Republicans Tuesday night, Mr. Trump told GOP holdouts to \"close your eyes and get there.\" Earlier in the day, he met with some of them at the White House, urging them to back the budget resolution adopted by the Senate\u00a0on Saturday.",
      "But more than a dozen members have balked at the low level of spending cuts in the Senate resolution \u2014 just about $4 billion \u2014 compared with the nearly $1.5 trillion in cuts in the House version. The budget resolution serves as a blueprint for implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities.",
      "\"They have to do this. They have to get there,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner, adding that he had a great meeting with some of the holdouts, but \"just in case there are a couple of Republicans out there \u2014 you just got to get there. Close your eyes and get there. It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding.\"",
      "The president criticized Democrats on their policies, but admired the fact that \"they always vote in unison,\" saying, \"you don't see somebody that's holding up.\"",
      "\"One little thing the Republican Party has to do is get together and damn vote,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that individual lawmakers may not get \"every little ounce \u2014 it doesn't work that way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, who's played a key role in shepherding the House GOP on legislation in recent months, promised a \"massive victory\" in the 2026 midterm elections if Republicans follow through on the budget resolution and enact his agenda more broadly. He argued \"they will not be able to even touch your seat,\" and he predicted they'd pick up \"40, 50, or even 60\" seats in the House, an outcome that would defy conventional political dynamics, with the party in control of the White House often losing control of the House in the midterms.",
      "\"If we don't get it done because of stupidity or a couple of people that want to show how great they are, you just have to laugh at them or smile at them or cry right in their face,\" the president continued.",
      "On Wednesday morning, as the House Rules Committee prepared to consider the budget resolution, the president posted on Truth Social to coax the conference to fall in line.",
      "\"Republicans, it is more important now, than ever, that we pass THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,\" he said. \"The USA will Soar like never before!!!\"",
      "Congressional leaders are pushing to get the budget plan adopted this week before they leave town for a two-week recess. Adopting the budget resolution marks the first step in the reconciliation process, a maneuver that enables Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass the measure with a simple majority. It will allow Republicans to approve the legislation funding the president's agenda without support from Democrats.",
      "After Republicans in the House and Senate had forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year, the Senate on Saturday adopted the compromise resolution, giving the House just days to overcome opposition and get it over the finish line before the recess. And while GOP leaders came together on the path forward in recent weeks, the approach has frustrated many House Republicans.",
      "The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more. At the same time, it allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. On top of that, the Senate-adopted plan relies on a budget scoring method known as \"current policy,\" which assumes that continuing the expiring current policies will incur no cost. Under that baseline, the $3.8 trillion it would cost to extend the Trump tax cuts would not be counted.",
      "The Trump tax cuts were originally passed in 2017 using a \"current law\" baseline, and they were set to expire this year. This scoring method, which was also used in the House budget resolution, means that the $3.8 trillion cost to extend the tax cuts is counted as new spending.",
      "Fiscal hawks have criticized the Senate-backed plan, including Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, who told reporters Tuesday that \"there's no way\" the House adopts it at this point. Burlison said he could be convinced by a guarantee that the Senate will make deeper spending cuts, calling the levels currently outlined in the resolution \"anemic\" and \"a joke.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, when asked if he'd consider backing the measure if he had assurances on spending cuts from the president, told reporters he would have to \"see some product from the Senate that actually shows that they're serious about cutting.\"",
      "Crane called the pressure from House GOP leadership to fall in line on the resolution to avoid jeopardizing the president's agenda \"nonsense.\"",
      "\"I think it's just another tactic to try and pressure us into the status quo,\" he added.",
      "During the House Rules Committee hearing on the resolution Wednesday, House Budget Committee chairman Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican, said he has \"concerns\" about the Senate's resolution guiding the reconciliation process.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, reiterated during the meeting that \"the math still doesn't math.\"",
      "\"The Senate budget is all tax cuts and no spending cuts,\" Roy said, adding that he doesn't trust a promise from the Senate to cut spending.",
      "Roy said his message to the Senate and House GOP leaders, along with the White House, is to \"come show me the math.\"",

      "Mr. Trump wrote: \"Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters during a race car event at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, the president was asked to explain how he reached a decision to issue the pause.",
      "\"Well, l thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, you know?\" the president said. \"They were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid, unlike these champions.\"",
      "\"I was watching the bond market,\" he added. \"The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it's, it's beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.\"",
      "The president said he \"did a 90-day pause for the people that didn't retaliate.\"",
      "Bessent said he expects the number of countries trying to negotiate with the U.S., which is over 75 now, to climb even higher.",
      "\"President Trump wants to be personally involved,\" Bessent said in explaining the reason for the 90-day pause.",
      "\"No one creates leverage for himself like President Trump,\" Bessent said. Despite the days of market volatility since the tariffs were announced, Bessent said this was Mr. Trump's \"strategy all along.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Leavitt reiterated Mr. Trump's insistence that he wasn't considering an extension or delay.",
      "But on Wednesday, the president said he'd been mulling a pause \"over the last few days.\" The president said he decided to forward with the pause early Wednesday morning. He and his top advisers wrote the statement without lawyers present, he said, and came \"from the heart.\"",
      "The so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs above the baseline 10% worldwide rate went into effect Wednesday.",
      "\"It's unfolded exactly the way it should. It's a beautiful thing,\" said top White House adviser Peter Navarro on Fox Business Channel.",

      "The nation's 988 hotline works like 911, bringing critical access to care for those battling mental health emergencies. Counselor Alejandra takes calls at the nation's largest suicide prevention center \u2014 Los Angeles' Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services. That one center receives 20,000 calls and texts a month.",

      "\"Since 2022, 12 million people have contacted 988 for help. So what that tells us is that people want the help,\" said Didi Hirsch CEO Lyn Morris, noting that these calls are oftentimes literal life or death situations.",

      "\"The ultimate goal is for all Americans to have access to crisis care for mental health and substance use issues, in the way that 911 provides rapid response for physical health emergencies,\" SAMHSA told CBS News in a statement. \"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is working diligently to support the development and sustainability of local treatment and support connected to 988, including the expansion of mobile crisis services and 24/7 walk-in crisis care clinics across the country. Transformation of this scale and building a cohesive crisis care system takes time, and there is more work needed to be able to deliver these critical services to the American public.\"",
      "Morris said additional cuts could lead to \"a very dire situation.\"",

      "\"Denisovan fossils are very scarce,\" with only a few confirmed finds in East Asia, said study co-author Takumi Tsutaya at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Japan.",

      "The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya.",
      "\"Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,\" study co-author Frido Welker told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery.",
      "The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.",
      "An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.",

      "\"The remains of three children not older than 4 years were found on three sides of the altar,\" Paiz told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Teotihuacan were traders who traveled all over the country (Guatemala),\" Paiz said. \"The Teotihuacan residential complexes were houses with rooms and in the center altars; that's what the residence that was found is like, with an altar with the figure representing the Storm Goddess.\"",

      "\"Congratulations, Sergey, congratulations on your arrival at the International Space Station,\" Russian mission control radioed. After extensive leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal, hatches were opened at 7:28 a.m., allowing Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim to float into the station.",

      "Rotating space station crews have typically carried out, on average, six-month tours of duty aboard the lab complex. But starting with Kim's flight, the Russians are increasing Soyuz durations to eight months to gather more data on the effects of long-term stays in space.",

      "In a pre-flight interview with CBS News, Jonathan Yong \"Jonny\" Kim, the son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, said he first heard of the Navy's SEALs when he was 16 years old. He eventually joined the elite corps and went on to participate in more than 100 combat operations as a member of SEAL Team Three in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.",
      "\"To me, it is the strongest calling I've ever had in my life, even to this day,\" he said. \"I've had additional callings in life. But it was really that first calling I had to be a SEAL that I will remember for the rest of my life. Because it was the first time that I felt I had a purpose, and I had a dream.\"",
      "That dream was to serve as a warrior.",
      "\"Back then, I used to have a really narrow focus on that,\" he said. \"But to me, a warrior is someone that is in continued pursuit of excellence in their craft. It doesn't have to be combat. It can be in medicine. It can be as a NASA astronaut. It can be in politics. It can be anything.",

      "King said traveling to space was never her dream, but she considered the opportunity and message it would send.",
      "\"There was something about being part of the first female team to me,\" King said. \"The group of women that they put together is so extraordinary to me that I thought, 'Wow. Why would I not wanna be a part of that?'\"",

      "With veteran commander Sergey Ryzhikov, 50, at the controls, flanked on the left by rookie cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky, 32, and on the right by Kim, 41, the Soyuz MS-27/73S ferry ship rocketed away from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1:47 a.m. EDT (10:47 a.m. local time).",
      "\"The crew is feeling good, everything is nominal,\" Ryzhikov periodically assured Russian flight controllers as the rocket climbed toward orbit.",

      "Path of totality for the 2045 total solar eclipse",
      "The next solar eclipse that crosses a significant portion of the continental U.S. will be in 2045, said Arav. That year, a solar eclipse on Aug. 12 will darken skies in parts of the U.S., Haiti, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname and Brazil.",
      "It will be visible in many states as it moves from coast to coast. The eclipse will start in California and move east to end in Florida, similar to 2017, Arav said.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 14:34:07 -0400",
    "summary": "Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams testified Wednesday afternoon before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism.",
    "story": [
      "Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams told senators in testimony Wednesday on Capitol Hill that the social media company worked \"hand in glove\" with the Chinese government to censor its platforms, among other allegations.",
      "\"I saw Meta executives repeatedly undermine U.S. national security and betray American values,\" Wynn-Williams said in her opening remarks, which were obtained by CBS News before the hearing.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism and led the bipartisan hearing, said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"made censorship his business model.\"",
      "\"The evidence that we have in black and white is a company and leadership that is willing to do anything, anything, work with America's chief competitor, work with our chief adversary,\" Hawley said.",
      "Hawley sent a letter to Zuckerberg Thursday requesting his testimony before the subcommittee, writing, \"The American people deserve to know the truth about your company.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams began working at Meta, then known as Facebook, as the director of Global Public Policy in 2011. In her almost seven years with the company, Wynn-Williams told the panel she witnessed the company provide \"custom built censorship tools\" for the Chinese Communist Party. She said a Chinese dissident living in the United States was removed from Facebook in 2017 after pressure from Chinese officials. Facebook said at the time it took action against the regime critic, Guo Wengui, for sharing someone else's personal information.",
      "Wynn-Williams described the use of a \"virality counter\" that flagged posts with over 10,000 views for review by a \"chief editor,\" which Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called \"an Orwellian censor.\" These \"virality counters\" were used not only in Mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan, according to Wynn-Williams's testimony.",
      "Wynn-Williams also told senators Chinese officials could \"potentially access\" the data of American users. When Meta engineers expressed concern about data security, Wynn-Williams testified that Meta leadership, including Zuckerberg, were indifferent.",
      "Wynn-Williams testified Zuckerberg was \"personally invested\" in Meta's business relationship with China, claiming he committed to learning Mandarin and \"had weekly Mandarin sessions with employees.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams alleged Meta's artificial intelligence model known as \"Llama\" was used to help DeepSeek. DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that sent shockwaves through the American technology industry earlier this year when its AI model was shown to be competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.",
      "In a statement last year on Llama, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote, \"The alleged role of a single and outdated version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing over 1T to surpass the US technologically, and Chinese tech companies are releasing their own open AI models as fast, or faster, than US ones.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams encouraged senators to continue investigating Meta's role in the development of artificial intelligence in China, as they continue their probe into the social media company founded by Zuckerberg.",
      "\"The greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot and saying he didn't offer services in China, while he spent the last decade building an $18 billion business there,\" she said.",
      "In response to her opening statement, a Meta spokesperson called Wynn-Williams' testimony \"divorced from reality and riddled with false claims.\"",
      "\"While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today,\" Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta, which changed its name from Facebook in 2021, operates some of the most popular social media platforms in the United States, including its previous namesake Facebook as well as Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.",
      "Washington is taking a more aggressive posture toward China and its growing threat to American economic interests and national security. The Trump administration increased tariffs on imported goods from China to 125% Wednesday. The administration also continues to pursue the sale of TikTtok, a short-form video platform owned by Chinese company ByteDance, to an American buyer. And on Capitol Hill in 2023, the House of Representatives created the Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party to investigate China's challenge to American global power.",
      "In March, Wynn-Williams published a memoir called \"Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed and Lost Idealism\" about her time at Meta.",

      "The iPhone maker shipped about 1.5 million iPhones, a cargo weighing roughly 600 tons, by air from India to the U.S., Reuters reported, citing sources with knowledge of the matter.",
      "The technology giant has taken a number of steps to mitigate the impact of President Trump's steep tariffs on China. That includes ramping up iPhone production in India, which is subject to far lower levies than China, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. Apple continues to make most iPhones in China.",
      "Apple has added workers in its main India factory, extending shifts to reach its goal of ramping up production by 20%, Reuters reported.",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 27% tariff on India, which Mr. Trump on Wednesday\u00a0paused for 90 days\u00a0along with import taxes on dozens of other countries as the U.S. seeks to negotiate more favorable trade deals. By contrast, a 125% \"reciprocal tariff\" on China remains in effect.",
      "Apple chartered cargo flights to transport the smartphones to the U.S. because it \"wanted to beat the tariff,\" a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Apple reportedly spent eight months lobbying Indian airport authorities to cut the phones' customs clearance time down from 30 hours to six hours. The company has chartered about six cargo jets since March, Reuters reported, citing two sources, including an senior Indian government official.",
      "Apple did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on the matter.",
      "Prices expected to rise",
      "Apple product prices are expected to rise\u00a0sharply under Mr. Trump's tariffs. iPhone sales account for about half of the company's revenue.",
      "Apple store workers report strong consumer demand for the company's devices before potential price hikes take effect. Recent data from UBS Investment Research shows that a 125% tariff on Chinese imports could lift the retail cost of an iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is assembled in China, as much as 67%, lifting the price $800 from $1,199 to $1,999.",
      "Research from Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives underscores the importance of global trade to ensure affordable consumer electronics prices in the U.S. If the iPhone were made in the U.S., a $1,000 model would cost $3,500, he said in a research note Tuesday.",

      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",
      "The cost of an iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which is made in India and costs $999, could increase to $1,119, an increase of 12%, the investment bank found.",
      "An April 3 analysis from Rosenblatt Securities found that the Cupertino, California-based company could raise iPhone prices by 43% to offset the effects of reciprocal tariffs.",
      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

    "story": [
      "A firing squad on Friday executed a South Carolina man who killed an off-duty police officer, the second time the rare execution method has been used by the state in the past five weeks.",
      "Mikal Mahdi cried out as the shots hit him, and his arms flexed. He groaned two more times about 45 seconds after that. His breaths continued for about 80 seconds before he appeared to take one final gasp.",
      "The execution was performed by a three-person firing squad at 6:01 p.m. He was pronounced dead by a physician at 6:05 p.m., the South Carolina Department of Corrections confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Mahdi, 42, chose to die by three bullets to the heart instead of lethal injection or the electric chair. On March 7, Brad Sigmon was executed in the first U.S. firing squad death in 15 years and only the fourth since 1976. The others all occurred in Utah.",
      "The firing squad is an execution method with a long and violent history around the world. It has been used to punish mutinies and desertion in armies, as frontier justice in America's Old West and as a tool of terror and political repression in the former Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.",
      "But South Carolina lawmakers saw it as the quickest and most humane way to kill an inmate, especially with the uncertainty in obtaining lethal injection drugs. Three volunteers fired the bullets that killed Mahdi.",
      "Mahdi is the fifth inmate executed by South Carolina in less than eight months as the state makes its way through prisoners who ran out of appeals during an unintended 13-year pause on executions in the state.",
      "Mahdi's is the 12th execution in the U.S. this year. Twenty-five prisoners in nine states were killed in all of 2024. Alabama and Louisiana have killed inmates by nitrogen gas. Florida, Oklahoma, Arizona and Texas have executed men by lethal injection, while South Carolina has used both the firing squad and lethal injection.",
      "Mahdi admitted he killed Orangeburg Public Safety officer James Myers in 2004, shooting him at least eight times before burning his body. Myers' wife found him in the couple's Calhoun County shed, which had been the backdrop to their wedding 15 months earlier.",
      "Myers' shed was a short distance through the woods from a gas station where Mahdi tried but failed to buy gas with a stolen credit card and left behind a vehicle he had carjacked in Columbia. Mahdi was arrested in Florida while driving Myers' unmarked police pickup truck.",
      "Mahdi also admitted to the killing three days earlier of Christopher Boggs, a Winston-Salem, North Carolina, convenience store clerk who was shot twice in the head as he checked Mahdi's ID. Mahdi was sentenced to life in prison for that killing.",
      "Mahdi's final appeal was rejected this week by both the U.S. and South Carolina Supreme Courts. His lawyers said Mahdi's original attorneys put on a shallow case trying to spare his life that didn't call on relatives, teachers or others who knew him and ignored the impact of months spent in solitary confinement in prison as a teen.",
      "The defense's case to spare Mahdi's life before a judge lasted only about 30 minutes. It \"didn't even span the length of a Law & Order episode, and was just as superficial,\" Mahdi's lawyers wrote.",
      "Mahdi's earliest memory was his father slamming his mother through a glass table and later lying to his son and saying his mother was dead. Mahdi's father pulled him out of school in fifth grade when officials suggested he needed behavioral help, defense lawyers said.",
      "Prosecutors said Mahdi constantly used brutality to solve his problems. As a death row prisoner, he stabbed a guard and hit another worker with a concrete block. Mahdi was caught three times with tools he could have used to escape, including a piece of sharpened metal that could be used as a knife, according to prison records.",
      "\"The nature of the man is violence,\" prosecutors wrote.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled Thursday the U.S. must facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and imprisoned.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge said Friday that the Trump administration failed to comply with an order for it to provide information she requested about a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, including where he is currently located and whether they have taken any steps to facilitate his return to the United States.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said in a written order that the administration \"made no meaningful effort to comply\" with her directive to file a declaration addressing three questions related to the confinement of\u00a0Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u00a0at a Salvadoran supermax prison: his current physical location and custodial status; what stems the administration has taken to facilitate his return to the U.S.; and what steps they will take and when to facilitate his release.",
      "\"From this court's perspective, defendants' contention that they could not answer these basic questions absent some nonspecific 'vetting' that has yet to take place, provides no basis for their lack of compliance,\" she wrote.",
      "Xinis directed the administration to file daily declarations providing information in response to her queries. Her written order came after a hearing Friday.\u00a0 The Justice Department had told her in a filing earlier in the day that it was unable to provide the information she requested about Abrego Garcia and called a Friday morning deadline she set to provide the details \"impracticable.\"",
      "Xinis had\u00a0ordered the Trump administration to give her information about Abrego Garcia after the Supreme Court on Thursday reaffirmed her directive for the federal government to \"facilitate\" his release from Salvadoran custody.",
      "During the hearing Friday afternoon, Xinis asked Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, why he could not provide answers to her questions, including on Abrego Garcia's whereabouts.",
      "\"I'm not asking for state secrets,\" she said. \"I'm asking a very simple question: where is he?\"",
      "Ensign repeatedly said he was not given information that he could provide to the court, including Abrego Garica's custodial status and who had authority over him. Trump administration officials are still evaluating the Supreme Court's order, he said.",
      "Xinis repeatedly pressed Ensign about where Abrego Garcia is. He noted that his lawyers said Abrego Garcia's last known location is in El Salvador and acknowledged the government has not put forth information to the contrary.",
      "The judge called the lack of evidence from the Justice Department about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts \"extremely troubling.\"",
      "\"It behooves this case and how the system of justice works that the following be communicated to your clients: You are the officer of the court. You are the instrument to represent\" the government, Xinis said. She said that the record in the case currently shows that despite her directive to take steps to bring Agrego Garcia back to the U.S., \"your clients have done nothing to facilitate\" his return.",
      "\"I'm not sure what to take from the fact that the Supreme Court has spoken quite clearly and yet I can't get an answer today about what you've done, if anything, in the past,\" Xinis said.",
      "Ensign told the judge that the federal government \"intends to comply with the Supreme Court's order.\" He said that while the administration is prepared to answer her questions about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and what actions have been taken to secure his return, they may assert privileges.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's lawyer, said his lawyers and family have not had contact with Abrego Garcia, and accused the Trump administration of \"playing games with their own lawyers.\"",
      "\"They clearly didn't comply\" with the district court's order to turn over information about Abrego Garcia, he said.",
      "In the\u00a0filing to the court ahead of the hearing, Justice Department attorneys told the judge they \"are not in a position where they 'can' share any information requested by the court. That is the reality.\"",
      "\"Defendants received the order late in the evening last night. They are reviewing the order and actively evaluating next steps,\" they wrote. \"It is unreasonable and impracticable for defendants to reveal potential steps before those steps are reviewed, agreed upon, and vetted. Foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines, in part because it involves sensitive country-specific considerations wholly inappropriate for judicial review.\"",
      "The Justice Department lawyers said that the judge gave them an \"insufficient amount of time\" to review the Supreme Court's order and argued she has not yet provided clarity as to the scope of her initial directive, as the high court told her to do.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys opposed the government's request for more time to respond to the judge's directives and accused the Justice Department of continuing \"to delay, obfuscate, and flout court orders, while a man's life and safety is at risk.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children, was arrested and removed to El Salvador last month after Trump administration officials accused him of having ties to the MS-13 gang.\u00a0 His lawyers said he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "The 29-year-old is being confined at the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT, along with other migrants sent there by the administration as part of an agreement with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. Under the deal, the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees.",
      "But Abrego Garica's case emerged as a flashpoint in President Trump's immigration crackdown after a U.S. immigration official acknowledged in a court filing that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "In 2019, an immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia relief known as withholding of removal, which forbids the government from returning him to his home country of El Salvador because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "While the Trump administration admitted the error in sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the district court has no jurisdiction over the Salvadoran government and therefore cannot force it to release Abrego Garcia from its prison. Justice Department lawyers have said that the Salvadoran government has custody of Abrego Garcia, so he cannot be returned to the U.S. unless it releases him.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his wife filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland following his arrest and removal, alleging it violated federal immigration law. They sought an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "Xinis granted that request last week following a hearing and directed the government to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The dispute ended up before the Supreme Court, and Chief Justice John Roberts put that deadline on hold to allow the high court more time to consider the matter.",
      "Then, on Thursday, the Supreme Court unanimously agreed that the Trump administration had to \"facilitate\" the release of Abrego Garcia from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador\" \u2014 to provide Abrego Garcia with due process of law.",
      "But the Supreme Court also directed the district court to clarify its order, and specifically the directive that the government \"effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said. \"For its part, the government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",

      "And then there's the day of the murder. Prosecutors say Monica's behavior that day is a key element of her role in the conspiracy to kill Fabio. According to prosecutors, surveillance video shows Monica left home at 3:26 p.m. driving the family's black Ford F-150 pickup.",
      "Michelle Miller (standing in a Target parking lot): This is where she came, according to prosecutors, to establish her alibi?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: So, a lot happens in this parking lot. \u2026 she pulls in here in her Ford-150 pickup truck right in front of this store \u2026 stops for just a few minutes.",
      "Prosecutors say they have video where it appears an individual gets into Monica's truck. They say that person was Robert Baker. Monica then goes alone into the Target store and begins shopping. But as she leaves, prosecutors say this surveillance photo shows her fixated on her phone.",
      "They would tell a grand jury it appears she was streaming video from her home \u2014 a lot of it.",
      "THE EVIDENCE AGAINST MONICA SEMENTILLI",
      "So what was Monica Sementilli watching on her phone that afternoon at about the time her husband was being murdered?",
      "Mary Fulginiti. The phone records and data show that she's connecting to a unique IP address. \u2026 It happens to be the IP address of the house. And there's a large amount of data that's being consumed. And that large amount of data is consistent with video streaming, i.e, the surveillance video of the house.",
      "Surveillance video? According to the DA, it might have been video from her home security cameras.",
      "But could Monica have been watching the actual murder?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: No\u2026 The surveillance cameras in the house are \u2014 are facing outside, but they're not facing in the pool area, which was where Fabio was located at the time. So, they didn't actually capture the murder, but they would capture obviously who was coming and going.",
      "Monica could have been watching everything else, prosecutors say.",
      "Mary Fulginiti (with Miller in the Target parking lot): They're going to argue \u2026 she's watching the scene, the scene of the crime to see the comings and goings of when Baker and the accomplice are going into the house, when are they leaving the house so that she knows when she can leave here and go home.",
      "Prosecutors say while she is watching the feed, Baker and his accomplice were on the Sementilli property stalking Fabio.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: According to the prosecution, \"it was a very targeted attack that was done with the intent to kill.\" They also go on to say that \"he was stabbed in the neck, it cut his jugular vein, cut the carotid artery.\"",
      "And there's more evidence of the plot to kill Fabio. Prosecutors say Baker was planning a future with Monica.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: The DA says that about two months before the murder, Baker told a friend that he had been dating this woman for about a year, and that he sent a picture of that woman, and that woman was Monica.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: And then two months later Fabio was killed.",
      "Authorities also say Monica's behavior after the murder is suspect. She didn't move her teenage daughters out of the house or have her security system repaired.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: And the prosecutors argued that the reason why she had no concern, because she knew who the killer was, and she was with him.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: This is a woman who is pretending to be a grieving widow and making all these posts on social media.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Who at the same time is carrying on a torrid love affair with the man who actually killed her husband.",
      "Prosecutors made explicit photos public in court filings. Some we can't show you. They say its evidence the secretive romance continued after Fabio's death.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: I mean, that's a double life. \u2026 The D.A. presented a photograph of Monica and \u2014 and Baker to the grand jury. And it was a photograph of Monica actually grabbing his crotch. \u2026 And this was one, uh, that was taken in Vegas.",
      "Michelle Miller: There was also this \u2014 this photo of a mirror.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Right. \u2026 it was a photo of the back of Monica \u2026 with Mrs. Baker, uh, written lipstick on the mirror.",
      "Michelle Miller: The \u2026 lipstick and the mirror \u2026 What \u2014 what does that tell them?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Again, this all goes to motive. I mean, Mrs. Baker \u2026 she wanted to be Mrs. Baker.",
      "But when detectives asked Monica about Robert Baker, prosecutors say she told them she wasn't even sure of his last name. They say she also told them she wasn't sure how to work the home security cameras.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: To quote the prosecution here, they say, \"She's a liar, she's a manipulator, she's a cheater. And everything that comes out of her mouth has to be taken with a large grain of salt large enough so that you could choke on it.\"",
      "Mary Fulginiti: If they can show that Monica lied about her lifestyle, about the affair, about a variety of other things, that they'll convince the jury that she's also lying about her involvement in this conspiracy to kill Fabio.",
      "And they say when she was later confronted about why Baker's blood was found in her house, she continued to lie.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: She comes up with some cockamamie story about, you know, playing racquetball with Baker and hitting him in the finger and that it was bleeding and there was a bloody towel and she had to bring it home and \u2014 and that's why his blood was at the house.",
      "But Fulginiti says one of the biggest pieces of evidence against Monica is what happened when police came up with a plan to secretly record the couple. It began when they pulled them over as they were driving.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: It's a ruse by the police. \u2026 They say that they think the car that they're in is stolen and they wanted to, you know, just check it out and you know, probably isn't and they handcuff them per protocol, put them into the police vehicle. But what they don't know is that vehicle's wired and that there's a van up the street with police in it listening to their every word. And it's at that point, Monica says, and I'm gonna quote here: \"Somebody must have talked. Somebody is doing this to us.\" And then she said, \"They must have something. They must have something.\"",
      "Mary Fulginiti: That's pretty damning evidence. \u2026 as a former prosecutor that is close to an admission to being involved in this conspiracy.",
      "According to detectives, Monica was also recorded telling her cellmate, \"He's not just my lover \u2026 he's my confidante \u2026 he's my everything.\"",
      "Detectives also intercepted letters Monica wrote to Baker from behind bars saying, \"I'm always amazed how we both know what the other is thinking. DESTINED!\" And \"I miss you so much my love!\"",
      "Mary Fulginiti: When you look at these pieces in the totality, it's going to put together a pretty perfect puzzle here. And the puzzle will paint this picture that Monica conspired with Baker, that he did not do it alone, that they did it together.",
      "But Monica's defenders say the case against her is flimsy, and they say Baker did it without her.",
      "Julie Rendelman: Robert Baker may have killed him because he wanted him out of the way. Maybe he did it because he hoped that by killing him, he would get Monica to himself. \u2026 That in and of itself does not establish that Monica was in on the murder.",
      "DEFENDING MONICA SEMENTILLI",
      "Monica Sementilli's defense is adamant she had absolutely nothing to do with Fabio's murder.",
      "Julie Rendelman: The defense's position is that there is no hard evidence, actually no evidence that establishes Monica Sementilli participated in conspiracy.",
      "And if you can't prove a conspiracy, you can't prove Monica's guilt says Rendelman.",
      "Michelle Miller: The sheer number of circumstances that seem to weave together\u2014 the parking lot meeting \u2026 the walking into the store and watching video that has streamed live from the home \u2026 the password being given to the killer \u2026 all of those things, the sum of them, wouldn't a jury believe is just too much of a coincidence?",
      "Julie Rendelman: Obviously, I can't answer for what the jury is gonna say. Um, the defense, I could promise you, is going to attempt to poke holes \u2014 holes in every single piece of evidence you just spoke about.",
      "Michelle Miller: So, let's go step-by-step \u2026 the sharing of that password for the surveillance video.",
      "Julie Rendelman: So, there is no question that she shared the password.",
      "But Rendelman says there's no connection between sharing that password and a murder plot.",
      "Julie Rendelman: There's absolutely no evidence between the six months that she shared it and the day he was killed, that establishes there was any plan in place between them whatsoever to have her husband killed, not a text, not an email, not a conversation with her best friend saying she's over her relationship.",
      "Julie Rendelman: The second issue is, there's absolutely no evidence that Robert Baker downloaded the app or ever even used the app.",
      "Michelle Miller: Let's talk about the actions in the parking lot the day of the murder. \u2026 someone appears to be getting into the car.",
      "Julie Rendelman: Keep a couple things in mind. One is from the defense's perspective \u2026 the video footage is so grainy that you can't make out who if anybody is getting into Monica Sementilli's car.",
      "And what about the allegation that she was watching video of the house as the murder took place?",
      "Michelle Miller: Once she went inside the Target \u2014 there was a point in time where she seemed fascinated, fixated on her phone.",
      "Julie Rendelman: Well, I'll tell you one thing. The prosecution doesn't know what she was watching on her phone. They cannot articulate nor will they ever be able to articulate what was going on in that phone.",
      "Michelle Miller: But it was being streamed from her home.",
      "Julie Rendelman: She could be watching a show, just like any one of us watched your show while we're walking along.",
      "Michelle Miller: The prosecution really digs in on Monica's character, the fact that she's having an affair.",
      "Julie Rendelman: Well, let me quote what the defense says in \u2014in regards to that. \"The prosecutor's evidence of Ms. Sementilli's affair and specifically the sexist and lurid manner in which it was presented \u2026 was irrelevant, improper and unfairly prejudicial to Ms. Sementilli.\"",
      "Julie Rendelman: They go on and say, \"the sexual and romantic details of their affair were simply irrelevant to the question, whether they conspired to murder Fabio Sementilli.\"",
      "But then why lie to investigators \u2014 allegedly saying she was unsure of Robert Baker's last name?",
      "Julie Rendelman: The question becomes, why is she lying? Is she lying because she committed a murder or is she lying because she has been in a tryst with someone for quite a while and doesn't want the world to know particularly, law enforcement?",
      "Prosecutors did find it suspicious that on the night Fabio died, Monica was already inquiring about his life insurance. But Rendelman says it's not odd.",
      "Julie Rendelman: I understand, um, how it could look insensitive to start asking about a life insurance policy so soon after. But if you're, uh, an individual that is not financially sound, you have two girls at home, you have potentially a mortgage to pay, you have bills to pay, you are going to be worried about the financial security of your family.",
      "And come trial, says Rendelman, what may really help Monica is that she won't be tried with Baker. \u00a0The jury will not see the man who committed the actual murder at the defense table next to Monica. \u00a0And that could make the case harder for prosecutors, says Fulginiti.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: The fact that he's her lover and the killer, the one that the DNA's around the house, I mean that \u2014 there is a spillover effect. And that all would've, you know, potentially impacted, I think, the jury in this case. And he's no longer there.",
      "Michelle Miller: Would you say it was his last gift to Monica?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Yeah, I would 'cause there's absolutely no other reason for him actually to plead straight up, without any real plea bargain here, to life without the possibility of parole, except I guess his last murderous chivalrous act.",
      "But it seems Baker may have an even bigger impact on Monica's case. \"48 Hours\" went to see him in jail, and he told us Monica had nothing to do with the murder of Fabio and she never knew that he was Fabio's killer. Baker also told us that he's no longer in touch with Monica and he has not decided if he will testify.",
      "Another factor that could help Monica, says Rendelman, the daughters Monica shared with Fabio are standing behind their mother.",
      "Julie Rendelman: And so, there's an argument to be made that the jury is looking at the daughter saying, \"if they believe her after all this, shouldn't we?\"",
      "As for Monica herself, she's never spoken publicly \u2013 except at a memorial for her deceased husband.",
      "MONICA SEMENTILLI (video from Fabio's memorial):\u00a0 How lucky am I to have lived the greatest love story of all time. A story that people only read about. A story that movies are made of. Thank you so much.",

She was headed to Target where prosecutors said she was establishing her alibi. Before Monica entered the store, according to prosecutors, there is video where it appears an individual got into Monica's truck. Prosecutors said that person was Robert Baker, a local racquetball coach who Monica had been having an affair with for about a year prior to Fabio's murder. Monica's defense attorneys have disputed the prosecution's interpretation of the video from the parking lot.

      "CASE UPDATE: On April 11, 2025, a jury found Monica Sementilli, the wife of famed hairdresser Fabio Sementilli,\u00a0guilty of murder\u00a0for his 2017 death in which he was beaten and stabbed in their Los Angeles home.",
      "It's an awkward moment sitting down with a murderer especially when you arrive unannounced.",
      "Robert Baker, 61, who pleaded no contest last summer to the 2017 Los Angeles murder of famed hairstylist and beauty industry executive Fabio Sementilli, 49, approached the glass that separated us with a \"who are you?\" look on his face.",
      "As a producer for \"48 Hours\" who has followed the case since 2017, I made the trip to Los Angeles' North County Correctional Facility on March 2 to see if Baker would be willing to share information about the brutal crime and, perhaps, his alleged accomplice\u00a0Monica Sementilli, 52. Monica was the wife of victim\u00a0Fabio Sementilli, and she was Baker's lover before they both landed in jail, nearly five months after the crime, accused of conspiracy to commit murder. Their case is profiled by \"48 Hours\" contributor Michelle Miller in\u00a0\"The Monica Sementilli Affair,\"\u00a0now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Baker seemed healthy and younger looking than the bedraggled figure I remembered from court. He had the fit and muscular appearance one might expect from a racquetball coach at the LA Fitness where he met Monica Sementilli, a mother of two teenage daughters living in a nearby, upscale L.A. neighborhood.",
      "Once I introduced myself, it was Baker who offered the initial icebreaker to our conversation, expressing surprise at the effort I had taken to find him in that remote jail in the mountain town of Castaic. Getting there can be a one-hour drive from L.A., and visitors are only permitted on Saturdays and Sundays. There are two separate intake areas to pass through, which involves a bus ride \u2013 not to mention security, where a reporter must leave pens, recorders and phones behind.",
      "So, the effort had paid off, it got the conversation started, and earned me credibility for finding him. These meetings can be difficult. The main issue is we are being recorded and the cops and prosecutors who put Baker away and have plans to put his former lover away listen, and presumably can and will use anything he says against him \u2013 or her \u2013 if possible.",
      "Nevertheless, our conversation moved along.\u00a0 Baker had an easy wide smile with a gap between his front teeth. The phone receivers we each used had short cords so that kept us face to face, staring straight into each other's eyes, from about 20 inches apart through safety glass.",
      "Despite his reluctance to address most issues, deferring answers to \"when this is all over\" (meaning the end of Monica's upcoming trial which starts April 2), he was resolute about one point: Monica was not involved in the murder, as she is charged.",
      "\"Monica did not know.\u00a0 She didn't know s***.\u00a0 If she did find out, I would have been in here (jail) a lot sooner,\" he said. His claim was a bombshell.\u00a0 Monica, who has already spent nearly six years in jail, did not conspire with him to kill her husband Fabio, he said.",
      "Despite what the prosecutor characterizes as overwhelming circumstantial evidence against Monica, there is no smoking gun connecting her to the conspiracy.\u00a0 A fact her attorneys are banking on for a not guilty verdict at trial.",
      "Why did Robert Baker plead guilty without a deal?",
      "I asked about his decision to plead no contest despite not getting a deal and accepting the sentence of life without parole. With his blood and DNA at the crime scene, having cut his finger stabbing Fabio to death, Baker had little chance to beat the charges. But even if his chances at trial were one in a million, most people take that shot. \"Why not you?\" I asked him.",
      "He seemed resigned to his fate but explained \"due process\" was the reason. Much of our conversation shifted to facial expressions, as he was clearly reluctant to be recorded saying certain things. I found myself unconsciously following his lead \u2014   and at that moment, I gave him an exaggerated \"What does that mean?\" face.",
      "\"You think there's due process?\" he responded to my look, as if I was the naivest person on earth to have faith in the criminal justice system that snared him.\u00a0 The phrase due process would serve as his unsatisfying default answer for many substantive questions.",
      "I asked if his plea was \"a gift\" for Monica, which he immediately scoffed at, seemingly taking offense, as if going down for life could be a gift.",
      "I pointed out, what he knew well, that for more than five years Monica's attorneys had tried many times to sever the cases against the lovebirds into separate trials, but the judge denied them at each turn.\u00a0 So, I noted when Baker pleaded no contest, voil\u00e0, thanks to his decision, Monica got what she had been asking for, to stand trial alone.\u00a0 He remained dismissive.",
      "I asked if he had met Monica in a Target parking lot two miles from the Sementilli home in the hours before the murder, as the prosecutor alleged, presumably to get the 'coast is clear' message from Monica to attack and kill Fabio.",
      "That allegation prompted an eyes wide open, lips pursed, \"no way\" expression as he shook his head back and forth. It never happened, according to him.",
      "He complained about that and other prosecution evidence. The fact that he and Monica used the encrypted apps WhatsApp and Viber to communicate between themselves, or that Monica shared her family's home security system's private log-in credentials with him. So what? he asked.",
      "I pointed out that while millions of Americans did use encrypted apps and accessed home security systems remotely, an objective person, say, a juror, might well find it suspicious that the lovers shared those prior to Fabio's murder. Baker remained indignant that those facts could be used against him or Monica.",
      "What about his Facebook messages with a friend where Baker said, \"No not yet living with her [Monica] but it's coming soon.\"\u00a0 Once again, Baker shrugged that off, \"just a conversation between friends.\" That explanation put the incredulous \"Huh?\" look on my face.",
      "\"Just a conversation between friends,\" he repeated with a shrug and a \"that's all\" expression. He just did not seem to get the prosecutor's point that a conversation between friends is precisely what was so revealing, and potentially incriminating \u00a0particularly because he murdered Fabio soon after.",
      "Robert Baker's sentence: Life without parole",
      "I turned the conversation to his sentencing hearing where numerous family members assailed him for taking away Fabio, a man so loved by two daughters, a son, two sisters and an immense family and circle of friends.",
      "\"Heartbreaking,\" he repeated a few times, \"heartbreaking.\" Baker had cried during the hearing, perhaps when Monica's daughters testified. What they may have seen as crocodile tears decidedly did not make an impression on the devastated family members and friends.",
      "I asked if that emotion at the hearing meant he wanted to apologize to Fabio's family. He offered nothing in reply just repeating, \"heartbreaking.\"\u00a0 \"I'm not the monster,\" he said, his voice trailing off before I could hear a finished thought.",
      "At that point, I had to interject, explaining that I had seen the autopsy report. Fabio had been viciously stabbed seven times, three separate wounds each deemed fatal as vital arteries were targeted. A beloved father, brother, son, friend, ambushed and slaughtered without a chance to defend himself.",
      "\"I know, I know,\" he said, dropping his head without meeting my eyes. He said only very recently had he seen the crime scene photos of Fabio \u2013 the gore and violence of the murder juxtaposed with the backdrop: Fabio's chair, where his family remembers him smoking cigars, \"Big Daddy\" baseball cap on his head, conducting business, and enjoying life in his favorite domain - the back patio.",
      "It was Fabio's then 16-year-old daughter who would find his body \u2013 too heavy as deadweight for her to even turn him over.",
      "Will Robert Baker testify at Monica Sementilli's trial?",
      "Earlier in our conversation, Baker conceded that he had recently been meeting with Monica's defense attorneys. Ostensibly, they are sizing Baker up for the possibility that he might testify at Monica's trial and drop that aforementioned bombshell on the jurors: that Monica was not involved, that she had no knowledge, that she never suspected her lover as the killer.",
      "Baker told me he does not know whether he will testify or not.",
      "I asked if he wanted to testify \"for her?\" For the second time, he took offense. \"I would not do it for her,\" he said. \"It would be to tell the truth.\"",
      "The idea that he might testify was heralded by her defense lawyers as a case closer.",
      "\"We are confident that Robert Baker's guilty plea and his truthful testimony will finally establish once and for all that Monica Sementilli had nothing to do with the planning or the murder of Fabio Sementilli, her husband,\" said veteran L.A. criminal defense attorney Leonard Levine after Baker's sentencing.",
      "Legal experts that \"48 Hours\" spoke to were more circumspect. They acknowledged the power of that potential testimony. They also pointed out a jury might be skeptical after a withering cross-examination and an exploration of Baker's background. Baker's testimony represented a risky proposition, they reasoned \u2014 likely too risky.",
      "Background was a question Baker raised. I responded that I was aware of his acting experience in the industry \u2014 the porn industry. Baker nodded his approval at my research. It seemed odd, as if \u2014 like so many people that reporters deal with in Hollywood \u2014 Baker was asserting, 'I was an actor you know,'\u00a0rather than displaying unease with the courtroom optics of pornography.",
      "Our time was limited, so I chose not to raise his criminal background, a conviction for having sex with a minor, his teenage stepdaughter, who would marry him after his release from prison in the 1990s and enter the pornography world, doing movies with Baker. It seemed to be a tangent.",
      "Rather, I wanted to discuss the prosecution's claim that Monica was leading a double life after Fabio's murder.\u00a0 Prosecutors alleged she was expressing an outward appearance through social media that she was deeply in grief over the loss of her husband, while police simultaneously, surreptitiously documented a secretive, fun-filled romance with Baker \u2014 the killer.",
      "Baker chose not to shrug off this accusation, insisting that Monica's grief over Fabio's murder was intense and sincere. As validation, he offered that the two were no longer in contact and that she cursed him with her parting words, \"Murderer motherf*****,\" yelled across a hallway in lock up. He was alleging that once Monica learned Baker was the killer, she dropped him, but he did not say when.",
      "Another bombshell, the claim that their relationship was now over, as court documents had revealed 2017 love letters signed \"your wifey\u2026 Monica Baker 'til death,\" sent in jail. When a sheriff's deputy suddenly appeared, Baker turned and left, ending our interview abruptly.",
      "Outside I waited for my bus next to a sign that read \"Beware of Mountain Lions, Do Not Leave Children Unattended.\"\u00a0 Relishing the fresh, crisp, mountain air, I reflected on a lively, yet guarded, conversation that yielded glimpses of candor whether intentional or inadvertent from a murderer.",

    "summary": "Intercepted love letters and surreptitious recordings between Monica Sementilli and Robert Baker allegedly reveal secrecy pact, coded language and sex games inside jail.",
    "story": [
      "CASE UPDATE: On April 11, 2025, a jury found Monica Sementilli, the wife of famed hairdresser Fabio Sementilli, guilty of murder for his 2017 death in which he was beaten and stabbed in their Los Angeles home.",
      "When Monica Sementilli and Robert Baker were arrested and accused of a murder conspiracy to kill Monica's husband, Fabio Sementilli, 49, their love affair continued in jail according to documents revealed in a \"48 Hours\" investigation of the case. Prosecutors allege their ongoing love affair behind bars, including recordings made during police sting operations, represent further evidence of a committed murder conspiracy between the lovebirds.",
      "\"It kind of hurts to not be touched or f***** or licked or loved by you,\" Monica, now 52, writes in one four-page letter to her codefendant. Baker, now 61, is blunt, recorded addressing Sementilli in lockup months after their arrest, \"I love you baby. I really do.\"",
      "On June 14, 2017, Baker and Monica were arrested and ultimately indicted for Fabio's murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Baker pleaded no contest\u00a0in July 2023, accepting a life sentence without parole. Monica will stand trial alone in April; she has pleaded not guilty. Their case is profiled by \"48 Hours\" contributor Michelle Miller in \"The Monica Sementilli Affair\" now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "On the day of their arrest, according to a recording released by police, Monica tells a cellmate how much Baker means to her: \"He's not just my lover, he's my confidant, he's my everything.\"",
      "Police engaged in an elaborate series of sting operations to continue to investigate the alleged conspiracy between the defendants even while they were held in custody, \"48 Hours\" has discovered. Police alternately used standard and creative means to intercept or record the defendants' interactions and statements, all of which is being offered as evidence of conspiracy in Monica's upcoming trial.",
      "For instance, \"48 Hours\" has confirmed that the cellmate to whom Monica spoke when she was first detained was an undercover police officer posing as an inmate to catch Monica speaking candidly on surreptitious recordings. Police call these types of jailhouse setups where officers pose as inmates inside jail Perkins Operations, referring to the case law which guides how these in-jail, sting operations are conducted.",
      "In the course of our investigation, \"48 Hours\" has learned that police went to even greater lengths than using undercover officers inside cells to ensnare Monica and Baker. As the two defendants were brought to courtrooms for their initial pre-trial hearings, detectives made arrangements for them to be held in adjoining cells prior to the hearings.",
      "Waiting in nearby cells to be brought into the courtroom, Monica and Baker had an opportunity to speak directly to each other. On six different occasions, first at the Van Nuys Courthouse and then at the downtown Los Angeles criminal courthouse, interactions between Monica and Baker were recorded.",
      "Beyond the sting operations, detectives also intercepted jail letters, referred to by inmates as \"kites,\" and listened to recorded jail phone calls to establish facts about the enduring love affair between Monica and Baker.",
      "\"48 Hours\" has obtained copies of three different jail love letters written from Monica to Baker which we have learned police intercepted while Monica intended to pass them to Baker in courthouse holding cells. \"48 Hours\" has learned that the detectives discovered the letters in holding cells while Monica and Baker attended the hearings. The detectives hastily made copies before carefully returning them for the inmates to retrieve after the hearings so that the defendants were unaware the love letters had been intercepted and copied.",
      "Meanwhile, Monica's defense has repeatedly argued, \"the sexual and romantic details of their affair were simply irrelevant to the question whether they conspired to murder Fabio Sementilli.\"",
      "According to prosecutors the information gleaned from these operations establishes that the ongoing jailhouse love affair is further evidence of the murder conspiracy between the accused.",
      "\"In essence, the defendants have promised one another that neither will cooperate with law enforcement or testify against the other to save themselves. Rather, they have promised one another that neither will cooperate with law enforcement or testify against the other to save themselves,\" wrote Deputy District Attorney Beth Silverman.",
      "The unusual situation where the two inmates could speak to each other while detained was designed by law enforcement purposely to record conversations between the unwitting defendants.",
      "Monica Sementilli and Robert Baker used secret code to express love and commitment inside jail, prosecutors cite as evidence of murder conspiracy",
      "According to a 2021 motion filed by the prosecutor, the recordings and intercepted love letters are evidence of an ongoing \"secrecy pact\" between the accused.",
      "\"The defendants often communicated with one another using cryptic language, phrases and codes created in order to secretly communicate without law enforcement's knowledge,\" including, \"the phrases, 'OMM,' '9pm,' 'LOML,' and '100,'\" according to a prosecution filing.",
      "Prosecutors allege these coded phrases establish the defendants' love and commitment not only to each other, but also the \"conspiracy\" and \"secrecy pact\" between them. \"OMM,\" they allege, means \"On My Mind,\" while they say \"9pm\" is a reference to a secretive plan to break jail rules and set timing for a phone call where a third party will connect the two to speak directly. The prosecutors contend \"LOML\" is an \"acronym meaning 'Love of My Life' and '100' indicates their 100% commitment to one another.\"",
      "According to prosecutors, another significant phrase is the one written at the end of one of Monica's love letters, \"R or D,\" an alleged abbreviation for the phrase \"Ride or Die.\"",
      "Detectives found a drawing \"depicting a couple embracing one another wearing only underwear and ski masks while holding guns\" in Baker's cellphone \"entitled 'Ride or Die.'\" There is a statement above the drawing, \"A relationship where you both love, protect and spoil each other is the best.\"",
      "\"The phrase 'Ride or Die' was frequently used between the defendants as an expression of their commitment to one another and their secrecy pact. On several occasions defendants expressed that they would remain loyal to one another, and never 'talk' to law enforcement about their conspiracy; in their words, they would 'Ride or Die' for one another,\" the 2021 filing asserts.",
      "Robert Baker and Monica Sementilli allegedly play sex games during recorded jailhouse encounters arranged and recorded by police",
      "The two lovers took advantage of six rendezvous engineered by detectives, according to motions filed in court. Monica and Baker were recorded \"talking to one another and engaging in masturbation and other sex games,\" wrote the prosecutor. The judge has ruled the alleged sex games portions of these recordings will not be admissible. Nevertheless, these encounters purportedly reveal the passionate nature of their continuing relationship in jail.",
      "Baker confirmed the sex games during an exclusive jailhouse interview with \"48 Hours\" on March 2. That's what happens when you are stuck in here, he said, gesturing to the jail side of the glass from where he talked to a reporter over a phone.",
      "Once those encounters stopped, the jailhouse co-defendants and lovebirds found ways to break the rules and remain in contact, according to prosecutors. In that 2021 filing, prosecutors said \"over the course of the last four years, the defendants made hundreds of calls through third parties \u2026 This allows them to speak to one another.\"",
      "These phone recordings have been shared with the defense as discovery but have not been made public.",
      "In excerpts reviewed by \"48 Hours\" from two of the six recorded encounters, there is talk of marriage, and in her letters, Monica consistently refers to herself as \"Mrs. Baker,\" \"Monica Baker\" and \"your wifey.\" \"MB\" is a code prosecutors allege is an abbreviation of Monica Baker.",
      "\"The defendants have continued to refer to one another as husband and wife while in custody for murdering Sementilli's legitimate husband,\" wrote the prosecutor, who cites this as dedication, not only to each other, but also to their murder conspiracy.",
      "Before the grand jury, prosecutor Silverman argued that the lovers' commitment motivated the conspiracy, saying they were \"plotting to kill [Fabio] in order to collect his substantial life insurance monies and be able to live hopefully happily ever after.\"",
      "Monica's attorneys have repeatedly challenged the evidence of a love affair as irrelevant to proving evidence of a murder conspiracy. There is no doubt, however, that Monica and Baker's\u00a0 commitment to their affair endured at least during the early months in jail, even for years according to the prosecutor.",
      "\"We will get married \u2026 You are the perfect wife for me. Beyond belief. My mind is like, I'm delirious,\" Baker says to Monica in a lockup recording.",
      "Similarly, she gushes to her lover as she ends a three-page-long letter, or \"kite,\" intercepted on Aug. 6, 2017, with \"Love your wifey\u2026 Monica Baker 'til death. R or D\"",
      "In jail sting, Robert Baker mentions Monica Sementilli facing \"difficulty\" of being \"disowned\" for loving and wanting to marry him",
      "\"48 Hours\" has identified one comment relating to this alleged jailhouse marriage talk that may indicate a separate issue at play in the murder conspiracy allegations.",
      "During the grand jury hearings, prosecutor Silverman argued divorce was not an option for Monica, so the couple instead turned to murder.",
      "\"She's from an Italian family, which means Catholic. They don't believe in divorce, her family won't, it won't be easy for them to take it \u2026 So again this provides a motive,\" said Silverman.",
      "Monica's defense attorneys have challenged this testimony as flimsy and misinterpreted, insisting the prosecutor has not established that divorce troubled Monica.",
      "However, in one of the recorded conversations between Baker and Monica on Aug. 31, 2017, which police refer to as \"lockup overhears,\" Baker seems to make a stunning admission regarding Monica while they discuss their desire to get married.",
      "\"So, when you gonna tell them \u2026 when you \u2026 when you gonna tell them \u2026 how we gonna tell 'em we're gonna get married? How we gonna do this? Then you'll really be officially disowned for loving somebody,\" Baker says in a seeming reference to Monica getting disowned for their relationship. Monica responds, \"I don't know \u2026 I think we may need to wait \u2026 until the trial, and see what happens with that.\"",
      "Baker then says, \"I'm not the one that has the, difficulty you do.\"",
      "The transcript made public in the prosecutor's motion is only an incomplete excerpt of the conversation. Nevertheless, this portion of the jailhouse exchange recorded by the Los Angeles Police Department seems to establish that Monica being \"disowned\" over her love for Baker may have been an issue for the lovers. Furthermore, Baker seems to confirm it as a \"difficulty\" for Monica. It is a tantalizing piece of a conversation, raising a significant issue that will almost certainly come into play during her trial.",
      "Monica's defense attorneys \"are not commenting on any evidence until it is presented at trial,\" said veteran L.A. criminal defense attorney Leonard Levine.",
      "Although it is unclear if the two defendants remain in contact today, after six years of incarceration, evidence appears to demonstrate the stunning revelation they remained dedicated to a relationship in the months after their arrest, perhaps extending for years. These love letters, sex games and promises seem to have continued even after Monica learned that evidence implicated Baker as her husband's killer.",
      "In an exclusive jailhouse interview with \"48 Hours,\" Baker claimed that now the two are prevented from contacting each other.\u00a0 He said, the last time they spoke, in a random encounter passing each other in lockup, she cursed him as a murderer. He did not indicate when this exchange occurred.",
      "Calling Baker a murderer would represent a significant turn in Monica's attitude, as evidenced through August 2017 in the jail letters and recordings. In his interview with \"48 Hours,\" Baker claimed that Monica took no part in a murder conspiracy and that he acted without her knowledge.",
      "Prosecutors dismiss the idea that Monica was not involved, detailing 56 overt acts which they argue constitute the conspiracy between the two lovers to murder the celebrity hairstylist turned beauty industry executive.",
      "Monica's defense attorneys intend to call Baker as a witness during Monica's trial.",
      "\"We are confident that Robert Baker's guilty plea and his truthful testimony will finally establish once and for all that Monica Sementilli had nothing to do with the planning or the murder of Fabio Sementilli, her husband,\" said Levine after Baker's sentencing.",
      "Whether or not Monica Sementilli's love affair with killer Robert Baker constitutes evidence of a criminal conspiracy or simply passionate infidelity will be at the heart of Fabio's wife's trial for his murder. Prosecutors plan to enter details of that love affair dating as far back as one year before the crime, continuing after Fabio's murder, and as revealed by \"48 Hours\"' investigation, even while the two were locked up awaiting trial.",

      "The S&P 500 gained 95 points, or 1.8%, to 5,363, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 619 points, or 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1%.",
      "After a week full of monstrous swings, the S&P 500 posted its best weekly performance since November 23, while the Nasdaq saw its best week since November 2022, according to the financial data firm FactSet. Even so, economists are cautioning that the growing trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp the nation's growth.",
      "\"'Rollercoaster' is not a technical term but it is probably the best adjective to describe price action across equity markets this week,\" noted Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, in an email.",
      "Beijing on Friday announced that it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. That matches the 125% duties on Chinese goods that President Trump\u00a0announced this week\u00a0\u2014 those tariffs will rise to as much as 145% for some of the Asian nation's products.",
      "\"The U.S. alternately raising abnormally high tariffs on China has become a numbers game, which has no practical economic significance, and will become a joke in the history of the world economy,\" a Chinese finance ministry spokesman said in a statement announcing the new tariffs. \"However, if the U.S. insists on continuing to substantially infringe on China's interests, China will resolutely counter and fight to the end.\"",
      "Pressure also eased a bit from within the U.S. bond market. The typically more boring corner of Wall Street has been flashing signals of stress this week that have been serious enough to demand attention from both Wall Street and President Trump.",

      "\"While the White House has tried hard in the last 1.5 days to spin things positively on trade, with a lot of talk about negotiations, investors are seeing through the noise and realize the irreparable damage inflicted on the global economy from Trump's reckless tariff campaign,\" equities analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told investors in a research note.",
      "The news for markets isn't uniformly grim. The Dow soared nearly 3,000 points on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq enjoyed their biggest one-day gains in decades after Mr. Trump\u00a0paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries, with the exception of China, for 90 days.",

    "story": [
      "All sense of survivors' guilt was fleeting for those residents whose homes remained standing after wildfires ripped through the Los Angeles area three months ago.",
      "Many worried that smoke from the Eaton wildfire that destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 18 people may have carried toxins, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals, into their homes. But they struggled to convince their insurers to test their properties to ensure it was safe to return.",
      "Nicole Maccalla, a data scientist, said embers burned more than half of her roof, several windows and eaves were damaged, and her house in Altadena was left filled with ash, debris, soot and damaged appliances. She said her insurance adjuster said USAA would pay for contamination testing, but after choosing a company and coming back with the results, her claim was rejected. The adjuster said the company only covered testing in homes with major damage.",
      "\"Every single item is a battle,\" said Maccalla. \"It's denials and appeals and denials and appeals, and you wait weeks and weeks and weeks for responses.\"",
      "Maccalla and others banded together as Eaton Fire Residents United, sharing indoor environmental testing data and compiling the results in an online map. Of 81 homes tested so far for lead, all show elevated levels, according to the group.",
      "\"I've already had multiple people reach out and say: 'Thank you for publishing this map \u2026 because my insurance company has changed their mind and approved testing,'\" said Maccalla, who helped design the data collection to verify results and maintain privacy.",
      "Many homeowners paid privately for the testing after their insurance companies refused, revealing gaps in coverage. The group hopes the data will help residents who can't afford it to convince their insurers to cover testing and remediation.",
      "\"If I can prove my community is not fit for human habitation then maybe I can show my home won't be,\" said Jane Lawton Potelle, founder of Eaton Fire Residents United.",
      "It's not easy to understand how and when it is safe to return home, Potelle said. The fine print of insurance policies can be frustrating and confusing, and the government has not stepped in to help.",
      "No help from FEMA",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has no plans to conduct widespread environmental testing. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is tracking environmental testing largely by academic researchers and a handful from government agencies, but most studies assess outdoor contamination.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven't standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don't torch the property.",
      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara released a bulletin in March that put the onus on companies to properly investigate reported smoke damage, saying they cannot deny such claims without investigating thoroughly, including paying for professional testing as warranted. But many residents have been left to fight for coverage anyway.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute that represents many major insurance companies, said it's hard to compare neighbors because every claim is unique due to each home's physical structure, actual damage and defined insurance coverage limits.",
      "\"It can vary and insurance companies are sensitive to what the claim is,\" Ruiz said. \"You have to work with your insurance companies and be reasonable about what may have happened.\"",
      "Disputes over fire damage coverage",
      "Dave Jones, director of the Climate Risk Initiative at University of California, Berkeley, and former state insurance commissioner, said testing should be covered even though some insurance companies disagree.",
      "\"It's perfectly reasonable for people to have some kind of environmental test done so that their home is safe and their property is safe,\" Jones said. \"We're talking about very catastrophically high temperature fires where all sorts of materials are melted and some of them become toxic.\"",
      "The state's insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over how it handles smoke damage claims. A 2017 change to the FAIR Plan limited coverage to \"permanent physical changes,\" meaning smoke damage must be visible or detectable without lab testing for claims to be approved. State officials said that threshold was too high and illegal, and ordered a change.",
      "Dylan Schaffer, an attorney leading a class action lawsuit challenging FAIR Plan's threshold, said he was surprised private carriers are disputing similar fire damage claims.",
      "\"The damage is not due to smoke, the damage is contamination from fire,\" Schaffer said. \"They make it complicated because it saves them money.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Altadena residents on the FAIR Plan say their claims are still being denied. Jones believes the debate will only end when lawmakers take action.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean declined to comment on the ongoing litigation and individual cases, but said the FAIR Plan pays all covered claims based on the adjusters' recommendations.",
      "\"Our policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage,\" McLean said.",
      "Potelle said the first inkling that her house might be toxic came after meeting with her AAA insurance adjuster in the days after the fire. Even though she had worn a mask, her chest still ached and her voice rasped, and she wondered whether her home was safe for her 11-year-old.",
      "Stephanie Wilcox said her toddler's pediatrician recommended testing their home. Her Farmers Insurance policy includes coverage for lead and asbestos in addition to her wildfire coverage, but after multiple denials, she paid out of pocket.",
      "\"After the initial inspection, (Farmers) had told us remediation would cost about $12,000 and that it would be habitable, like we could move back in tomorrow,\" she said. \"But now there's no way.\"",
      "She plans to ask for a new estimate including lead abatement and other costs, citing the results.",
      "Similarly, Zach Bailey asked in late January for contamination testing. The house he shares with his wife and toddler sits in an island of largely spared homes among blocks wiped out by the fire. After months of denials, State Farm agreed to pay for lead and asbestos testing because the remediation company cited federal worker safety regulations.",
      "It shouldn't have been that hard, he said.",
      "\"It feels like the insurance companies should have a playbook at this point,\" he said. \"They should have a process to keep people safe because this isn't the first disaster like this.\"",

She had been at a client's home on Long Island, and said she believed someone was after her. She took off running and told the 911 operator there were people trying to kill her. Then, Gilbert vanished.",

She had begun working as an escort, posting ads on Craigslist and other websites to meet clients. On July 6, 2007, her cellphone was contacted by a burner cellphone \u2014 a prepaid phone that anyone can buy and use anonymously.

      "June 6, 2010: Megan Waterman vanishes",
      "At 1:31 a.m., Waterman's phone was again contacted by the same burner phone as the day before. Security video showed Waterman leaving a Holiday Inn Express in Hauppauge, Long Island, around the same time. This was the last time she was seen alive.",
      "\"I can't bring her back\"",
      "Liliana Waterman was just 3 years old when her mother disappeared. In her first television interview in 2020, Liliana (pictured with Megan Waterman) told \"48 Hours\" that if she could talk to her mom, she would tell her how much she loves her. \"I never got to really say those words,\" Liliana told correspondent Erin Moriarty. She said she misses her mom every day.",
      "Sept. 2, 2010: Amber Costello disappears",
      "Amber Costello, a 27-year-old escort living on Long Island, was contacted by someone using a burner phone. The next day, she left her house to meet a client and never returned.",
      "After Costello's disappearance, police say her roommate Dave Schaller told them about her clients. He described one of them as looking like an \"ogre\" and having \"a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche.\" On the night she went missing, Schaller says, a client offered Cistello $1,500 for the night \u2013 six times her hourly rate.",
      "In 2011, Schaller spoke to Moriarty. \"This guy was so relentless,\" Schaller said. \"He called several times. He was on the phone with her for quite a while each time.\" He says the client got Costello, an experienced escort, to do something she never did: leave home without her purse or cellphone and meet him in his car. At nearly midnight, Schaller says Costello left the house, walked down the street, and he never saw her again.",

      "In December 2011, a year-and-a-half after she went missing, and a year after the Gilgo Four were found, investigators found\u00a0 Gilbert's remains. But they don't believe she was murdered.",
      "Years later, the Suffolk County Police Department released the full audio of Shannan's 21-minute 911 call on May 1, 2010, the morning she disappeared. Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison said in an interview with Erin Moriarty, Gilberts's death was likely not a murder. \"It's an unfortunate incident, but right now we believe that she just ran into the marsh and unfortunately drowned,\" Harrison said.",
      "February 2022: A fresh look at the case",
      "For nearly a decade after the discovery of the Gilgo Four, the investigation stalled. Until, in February 2022, a new task force was formed by Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison and Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney. In an interview withMoriarty, DA Tierney said, \"... a mere six weeks later ... Rex Heuermann was identified for the first time.\"",
      "A tip from the past",
      "How did investigators get a suspect in six weeks? It turns out that in the original case files were a number of critical clues that the new task force was finally able to connect. Costello's roommate Dave Schaller had previously described one of Costello's clients and the type of vehicle he drove to investigators. The vehicle was a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche.",
      "With a description of an\"ogre-like\" man, and the make and model of his truck, police took a closer look at Costello's phone records from 2010. Schaller had told them that before Costello disappeared, there was one client that called her incessantly.",
      "The burner phone clue",
      "Police back then knew the client was using a burner phone. And they knew that the Brainard-Barnes, Barthelemy, Costello and Waterman \u00a0had all been in contact with burner numbers right before they disappeared.",
      "In 2012, with the help of the FBI, police determined that most of those calls connected to cell towers inside a small area of Massapequa Park, Long Island. They called this area \"the box.\" According to DA Tierney, \"the box\" consisted of a couple of blocks within Massapequa Park.",
      "A suspect in sight",
      "Armed with their small radius of \"the box\" and the description of an \"ogre-like\" man that drove a Chevrolet Avalanche, the task force now had a prime suspect. Police identified an architect named Rex Heuermann as the man they believed may have been responsible for the murders.",
      "And when they looked at Heuermann's personal cellphone records, they say that his phone was in the same area as those burner phones when they were used to contact victims. They also say that when the burner phones contacted victims, they were often in Massapequa Park, where Heuermann lived, or midtown Manhattan, where his architectural firm was located. In 2023, they noticed Heuermann going into a phone store to make a payment on a burner phone.",
      "A DNA hit",
      "Police began to tail Heuermann. When he threw out a pizza box into a trash can in midtown Manhattan, investigators found that Heuermann's DNA on the pizza crust was consistent with a DNA profile found on a male hair discovered with Megan Waterman's body. With DNA evidence, along with the cellphone records linking Heuermann to the burner phones, officers made an arrest.",
      "July 14, 2023: A suspect in custody",
      "Rex Heuermann, of Massapequa Park, Long Island,\u00a0 was\u00a0charged with multiple counts of murder\u00a0in the deaths of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello. Heuermann is currently the prime suspect for the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, but he has not been charged with her death.",
      "When asked about Heuermann's innocence at a press conference, Heuerman's attorney Michael Brown said, \"What has my client told me? He told me he didn't do this.\"",
      "Digging for evidence",
      "Police spent 12 days looking through Heuermann's house, pulling guns out of the basement, and digging in the backyard. Another important piece of evidence taken into possession was a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche registered to Heuermann at the time of the murders. It was sitting on property he owns in South Carolina when they recovered it.",
      "An opportunity to kill?",
      "A married man, Heuermann has a daughter and stepson with his second wife, Asa Ellerup. Ellerup, who was born in Iceland, would take the children to see her family there in the summers. It was during these trips and others, police believe, that Heuermann killed the women.",
      "Heuermann pleaded not guilty",
      "Heuermann was arraigned in Suffolk County Court in Riverhead, New York. He pleaded not guilty to the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello. The judge ordered that he be held without bail in a Suffolk County jail where he is currently awaiting trial.",
      "Remembering Amber, Melissa and Megan",
      "Investigators hope that the arrest can give victims' families a sense of peace. Police Commissioner Harrison told Erin Moriarty, \"He took away somebody's mother, somebody's daughter, somebody's sister, not just one person, multiple individuals.\"",
      "Other investigations?",
      "Investigations spread to South Carolina and Las Vegas where Heuermann owns property, with detectives there taking a fresh look at cases of missing women. Heuermann has not been charged in any additional investigations.",
      "As for the other bodies found near Gilgo Beach \u2013 Jessica Taylor, Valerie Mack, Karen Vergata, \"Peaches\", the toddler girl, and the Asian male \u2013 none of them have been linked to Heuermann.",
      "Prosecutors: Suspect's cheek swab matches pizza box DNA",
      "DNA from Heuermann's cheek swab matches the DNA that authorities had previously collected from a pizza crust and used to link Heuermann to one of the victims, according to prosecutors during a Sept. 27, 2023 court appearance. Heuermann's lawyer disputed the significance of the DNA sample.",
      "Jan. 16, 2024: Heuermann charged with fourth killing",
      "Six months after his arrest, Rex Heuermann was indicted in the death of a fourth alleged victim, Maureen Brainard-Barnes. Investigators said they linked Brainard-Barnes' murder to Heuermann via DNA from a female hair found in the buckle of a belt used to bind her ankles, feet and legs - eight trillion to one that it matched Heuermann's wife Asa Ellerup or daughter Victoria, who was tailed on a commuter train and threw out an energy drink, according to court documents. Prosecutors made it clear they believed all hair transfer were made from Heuermann to his alleged victims. The family was out of town for the murders of the Gilgo Beach Four. Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to the murders.",
      "June 6, 2024: Two more cases linked to Heuermann",
      "Heuermann was charged with\u00a0killing two more women 10 years apart on Long Island \u2014 the 1993 murder of Sandra Costilla and the 2003 murder of Jessica Taylor. Costilla's death was not previously tied to the Gilgo case. The Suffolk County\u00a0district attorney's office says\u00a0DNA from hair found near Costilla and Taylor's remains and pick-up truck evidence connect Heuermann to their killings. Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
      "Dec. 17, 2024: Heuermann charged with 7th killing",
      "Heuermann was charged with killing Valerie Mack, a 24-year-old from New Jersey who had been working as an escort in the Philadelphia area, in 2000. For years, she was known only as \"Jane Doe #6.\" Her partial remains were found in Manorville, Long Island, in 2000, and more of her remains were found on Gilgo Beach more than 10 years later.",

      "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told\u00a0CNBC\u00a0Thursday that he expects the tariffs to lead to higher prices on a host of consumers goods, noting that the site's third-party sellers are likely to pass on tariff-related costs.",
      "Some consumers are also preparing for price hikes by\u00a0stocking up on goods\u00a0they think are likely to become more expensive if U.S. \"reciprocal levies\" on dozens of countries,\u00a0which are paused for 90 days, take effect.",
      "A 10% tariff on all U.S. imports remains in place. China, which accounts for nearly a third of all goods imported into the U.S., faces levies of up to 145% for some items. In an escalation of the trade war between the world's two largest economics, Beijing fired back Friday by announcing it will hike duties on American exports from 84% to 125% and deriding Mr. Trump's tariffs as a \"joke.\"",
      "Tariff fees on what you buy",
      "Although the tariffs and retaliatory moves by other countries have yet to hit economic growth, U.S. businesses aren't waiting around. Some are introducing \"tariff surcharges,\" announcing new prices on their websites and in letters to consumers.",
      "Labucq, which sells high-end footwear that is fabricated in Italy, addressed tariffs and their effect on pricing in a recent social media\u00a0post. The company said a 20% U.S. tariff on imports from the European Union, which Mr. Trump announced on April 2 before pausing them, would require the company to hike prices by 10% beginning April 15. Labucq said its pricing will then jump by an additional roughly 10% on May 7, noting the increases are necessary for it to \"remain sustainable.\"",
      "Dame, a sexual wellness brand that makes adult toys and personal care products, has implemented a $5 \"Trump tariff surcharge\" that is automatically added to customers' online shopping carts at checkout.",
      "Dame CEO Alexandra Fine said the fee doesn't cover all of its extra costs and that the company is analyzing its pricing given that most of its products are made in China. \"Our whole industry is in China, so we've already seen the impact,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Fine also said she wants to be transparent with customers about what is happening, rather than quietly inflating prices.",
      "\"The intention of adding the Trump tariff surcharge as a line item at checkout was to remind people that this is an extra tax on us. I wanted people to understand why it's more expensive \u2014 that it's because of political decisions that were made,\" she said.",
      "Other companies are also moving to raise prices. In a quarterly earnings call last month, a senior executive with U.S. chip maker Micron said some of its products would be subject to higher U.S. tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China and that it plans to \"pass those costs along to our customers.\"",
      "Honeywell Building Automation, which designs safety and efficiency systems for buildings, in early March announced new pricing related to fresh tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. The company started applying a 6.4% \"tariff surcharge\" on its building management systems, excluding software and subscription services, saying the move was necessary \"to mitigate the impact of tariffs.\" Honeywell also said it would eliminate the extra duty \"as soon as such tariffs are no longer in force.\"",
      "Lemonade out of lemons",
      "Other companies are using the situation as a promotional tool. While it's true that consumers could eventually pay more if they wait to purchase furniture, electronics, automobiles and more, \"pre-tariff sales\" play into consumers' fear that prices could rise, and can be an effective way to boost sales, according to experts.",
      "\"The tariffs are injecting uncertainty into the marketplace and when there is high uncertainty, consumers tend to overestimate their losses, so they try to hedge their losses as much as possible in a very irrational way,\" Denish Shah, professor of marketing at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "And in times of market uncertainty, explains Denish, consumers are prone to panic-buying.",
      "\"They tend to stockpile necessities, fearing that tomorrow, suddenly, prices could go up. So they'll say, 'Let me try to accelerate all the purchases I can that I would have made anyway,'\" he said.",
      "That said, consumers' overarching goal, particularly after battling years of relentless inflation, is to save money. \"Consumers are very price-sensitive in this environment, so they are going to react very strongly to sales that companies are promoting,\" Shah added.",
      "The pre-tariff sales strategy is already working for some sellers, such as Burlap & Barrel, a spice company that imports single-origin spices from around the world. It sources ingredients from small farms in Guatemala, Iceland, India, Spain, Turkey, Vietnam and more. Over the weekend, the spice importer announced\u00a0a \"spring cleaning-turned-impromptu Tariff sale,\" marking down all products by 20%, through Tuesday.",
      "\"When we planned this sale, we thought it'd be a routine springtime promotion, but in the last few days it has turned into something very, very different,\" Burlap & Barrel wrote in a social media post. The company said that it's waiting to see how tariffs are applied to its products, but it's sure that they \"will be bad for our business,\" given that it cannot easily overhaul its supply chains.",
      "The company states that it is running the sale \"To show that we're serious about not raising our prices, and to finance another year or purchasing from smallholder farmers in the face of economic instability and political crisis.\"",
      "Another company, Freewrite, sent an email to customers on Friday urging them to buy its digital typewriters before it hikes prices on its China-made products next week due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Everyone, including our contract manufacturing partners, is helping us explore our options, but the truth is that it is incredibly difficult to move factories. It takes careful planning, huge expense and much more time than we have,\" Freewrite CEO Adam Leeb wrote in the email. \"On Monday, we will be raising prices. Not because we want to, but because we have to.\"",
      "Large chains are putting their own spin on tariff-related promotions. Furniture maker Raymour & Flanigan is urging customers to \"lock in pre-tariff pricing\" in a banner on its website.

      "Comans made the determinations Friday afternoon, inside the courtroom of the privately operated U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Jena where Khalil has been held for weeks.",
      "Khalil, a vocal member of the protests at Columbia University over the war in Gaza, was arrested in early March by ICE, outside of his New York City apartment, where he lived with his pregnant U.S. citizen wife.",
      "After Comans issued her ruling, Khalil, attired in a blue uniform and sandals, asked to be allowed to give remarks.",
      "Khalil noted that the judge had previously talked about \"due process and fundamental fairness,\" and the former Columbia student said those principles were not followed in his case.",
      "Khalil said the Trump administration shipped him \"1,000 miles away\" from his family. He concluded by telling the judge that the cases of other migrants detained here at the ICE facility in Jena, Louisiana should also be addressed with urgency.",
      "After the hearing, Marc van der Hout, an attorney for Khalil, said in a statement, \"Today, we saw our worst fears play out: Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent. This is not over, and our fight continues.\"",
      "\"If Mahmoud can be targeted in this way, simply for speaking out for Palestinians and exercising his constitutionally protected right to free speech, this can happen to anyone over any issue the Trump administration dislikes,\" van der Hout added.",
      "The government hasn't charged Khalil with any crime, but it has argued in immigration court that he should be stripped of his green card and deported on two civil immigration grounds.",
      "The Trump administration has invoked a rarely used provision of immigration law that allows the government to seek the deportation of noncitizens whose \"presence or activities\" are determined to \"have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "Faced with a deadline this week to provide evidence against Khalil, the Department of Homeland Security filed a memorandum by Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlining the foreign policy rationale.",
      "Rubio cited no specific evidence against Khalil, a 30-year-old legal permanent resident whose American citizen wife is in the late stages of pregnancy. But he said Khalil's presence in the country undermines \"U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\"",
      "The Trump government has separately alleged that Khalil committed immigration fraud by failing to disclose certain information in his green card application, including his work for the British Embassy in Beirut and the United Nations agency for Palestinian migrants and refugees.",
      "Khalil's attorneys harshly criticized Rubio's memo and the government's case against Khalil. They claim the government is violating Khalil's right to free speech.",
      "\"If the secretary of state claims the power to arrest, detain and deport someone, including a lawful permanent resident, simply because that person dissents from U.S. foreign policy, there are no limits. There's no beginning and no end to that kind of executive power,\" said Johnny Sinodis, an attorney for Khalil's immigration case, on Thursday.",
      "Khalil has separately sued the government over his arrest, detention and the effort to deport him. That case, in federal court in New Jersey, seeks an order that would require Khalil's release and the rescinding of the Rubio determination. It also asks a judge to prohibit the Trump administration from targeting noncitizens \"who engage in constitutionally protected expressive activity in the United States in support of Palestinian rights or critical of Israel.\"",

    "summary": "Each death penalty case is autho\u00adrized by the DOJ headquarters in Washington, D.C., in con\u00adsul\u00adta\u00adtion with local U.S. Attorney offices, who prosecute the cases.",
    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors were directed by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi this week to pursue the death penalty against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson last year in New York City.",
      "Mangione allegedly shot Thompson as the executive was headed to a health care conference on Dec. 4, killing the father of two on the street. The 26-year-old faces federal murder and stalking charges and 11 state charges, including murder and terrorism charges, which are not eligible for the death penalty.",
      "\"After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again,\" Bondi said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office directing the Department of Justice to seek the death penalty where applicable.",
      "Attorneys for Luigi Mangione asked a judge to stop federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty against their client, saying the U.S. government \"intends to kill Mr. Mangione as a political stunt.\"",
      "The motion filed 11 days after the death penalty announcement in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District said U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi\u00a0ordered\u00a0the death penalty to \"carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.\"",
      "\"This move is one in a series of moves for the Trump administration to 'restore' the federal death penalty,\" said Corinna Barrett Lain, death penalty expert and a law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.",
      "The Mangione case is the first high-profile one to come under his administration's directive, Lain said; however, the federal death row landscape has changed dramatically since Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 and the appetite for executions nationwide has plummeted. In 2024, there were 26 new death sentences; in 2004, there were 125, she said.",
      "New York State, where Mangione is charged, abolished the death penalty in 2007, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a not-for-profit organization based in D.C. According to their tracking, although there were prisoners on New York's death row in 2007,\u00a0an execution hasn't taken place there since Eddie Mays in 1963.",
      "Federal prosecutors might find themselves in the same situation with Mangione, Lain said, who has written a book on lethal injection, as it can take a federal death penalty case at least two decades to wind its way through the legal system.",
      "What is the federal death penalty?",
      "The federal death penalty is in all 50 states and U.S. ter\u00adri\u00adto\u00adries but is used rel\u00ada\u00adtive\u00adly rarely compared to the use of capital punishment by states. How it is applied is decided by a policy the U.S. Department of Justice has written in its justice manual, Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Information Policy Center, told CBS News.",
      "The manual details how \u2014 or why \u2014 federal prosecutors decide to seek a federal death sentence, said Maher.",
      "\"It's not clear that that process has been followed with respect to this decision to seek death for Mr. Mangione,\" Maher said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice said the death penalty can only be imposed on defendants convicted of capital offenses, such as murder, treason, genocide, or the killing or kidnapping of a congressman, the president, or a Supreme Court justice. Mr. Trump expanded the scope in his January executive order, saying federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty \"for the most serious, readily provable offenses.\"",
      "Each case is autho\u00adrized by the Department of Justice headquarters in Washington, D.C., in con\u00adsul\u00adta\u00adtion with local U.S. Attorney offices, who prosecute the cases.",
      "What is a federal execution?",
      "A num\u00adber of fed\u00ader\u00adal death sen\u00adtences were pros\u00ade\u00adcut\u00aded in states that have abol\u00adished the death penal\u00adty, the Death Information Policy Center said. Inmates who have received a federal death sentence are executed at the fed\u00ader\u00adal death cham\u00adber in the U.S. Penitentiary Terre Haute in Indiana.",
      "Most federal executions are carried out by lethal injection \u2014 until 2020, it was the sole method of execution. Methods were then expanded to include ones autho\u00adrized by the state in which the fed\u00ader\u00adal death sen\u00adtence was imposed. In some cases this could be by firing squad, such as the recent execution in South Carolina, or by\u00a0nitrogen gas, which was used in Alabama and Louisiana.",
      "Between the rein\u00adstate\u00adment of the fed\u00ader\u00adal death penal\u00adty in 1988 and 2024, 80 federal defen\u00addants were sen\u00adtenced to death and 16 were exe\u00adcut\u00aded.",
      "Under the first Trump administration, 13 people were executed over 6 months in 2020-2021, DPI confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Who is on federal death row?",
      "Fed\u00ader\u00adal death row pris\u00adon\u00aders from all over the coun\u00adtry are housed in the Special Confinement Unit at U.S. Penitentiary Terre Haute in Indiana.",
      "Many death row inmates die from old age, Lain said, and many are never executed. Cases can take at least a decade to wind through court and millions of dollars to judge, \"is this a life worth saving?\" said Lain, who said each death row case has two trials, one for the crime and the other for sentencing. In effect, criminals are being sentenced to \"life without parole with a random chance of execution,\" and the government is paying millions for the prosecution, she said.",
      "There are three prisoners currently on federal death row:\u00a0Roberts Bowers, who was convicted in 2023 for the mass shoot\u00ading at Tree of Life Synagogue;\u00a0Dylann Roof, who was convicted in 2017 for the fatal shoot\u00ading of nine parish\u00adioners in a Black church in Charleston, South Carolina; and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\u00a0for the 2015 Boston Marathon bomb\u00ading.",
      "Then-U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland put a moratorium on federal executions in place shortly after taking office so that an internal DOJ review of execution policies and practices could take place, Maher said. That moratorium on executions was in place until the end of the Biden administration.",
      "Former President Joe Biden com\u00admut\u00aded the death sen\u00adtences of 37 out of 40 fed\u00ader\u00adal death row pris\u00adon\u00aders to sen\u00adtences of life without parole on Dec. 23, 2024, before he left office.",

      "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the U.S. economy faces a critical stretch, while also warning of the ongoing uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariff policies.",
      "\"The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and 'trade wars,' ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility,\" he said Friday during the banking giant's first-quarter earnings call.",

      "Dimon, considered the country's most influential banking leader, said earlier this week that U.S. tariffs could lead to higher inflation, weaker economic growth and potentially even a recession.",

      "It was a hot summer day in August 1987 when Selonia's body was found inside her blue Chevy Sprint in a parking area about one-and-a-half miles from the Reed home. Police said she had been bludgeoned, stabbed multiple times and stripped naked. It was clear, police said, that she was sexually assaulted.",
      "Selonia's husband Reginald Reed Sr. had reported her missing an hour or so before her body was found. Reginald told police on the morning of Aug. 23, 1987, that Selonia told him she was going out with a girlfriend the night before. That girlfriend later told police the two had \"no plans\" to go out that night, but Reginald stuck to his story.",
      "As the investigation unfolded, police learned that Selonia had told relatives that Reginald was physically abusive and had talked about getting a divorce. He became an early suspect, but none of that suspicion reached the ears of Reggie, who was only a child.",
      "Reggie was questioned by police after they received permission from his father. The police videotaped Reggie's interview with a police detective while his father sat next to him. He vouched for his father's version of events, saying the two of them spent the evening playing video games and sleeping in the same sofa bed. In effect, Reggie became his father's alibi. Years later, Reggie viewed that interview and became emotional when he saw his 6-year-old self crying that he wanted his \"mommy\" and \"daddy.\"",
      "\"I just can't imagine what it's like as a 6-year-old to have to sit there,\" said Duthiers.",
      "\"Looking at that, it's still hard to believe that that's me,\" said Reggie. \"Watching that video just brings back so \u2026 so many questions and \u2014 and pain because \u2026 I see me crying.\"",
      "Reggie wrote a memoir about his experiences titled, \"The Day My Mother Never Came Home.\"",
      "Reggie had no idea that his father was the prime suspect in the case until 25 years later in 2012 when a Texas Ranger showed up at his home. By then, Reggie was 31, had graduated college and was working for a pharmaceutical company near San Antonio.",
      "\"I was like, where's this coming from?\" Reggie told \"48 Hours.\" \"I remember asking, is there any new evidence that was surfaced?\"",
      "But over the next few years, the new lead investigator in the case, Lt. Barry Ward of the Louisiana State Police, was able to come up with new evidence. Eventually, it was enough that Reginald and an alleged accomplice were indicted for second-degree murder.",
      "The accomplice, a friend of Reginald named Jimmy Ray Barnes, agreed to testify against Reginald in exchange for a five-year prison sentence. In November 2022, Reginald Reed Sr. was found guilty of second-degree murder for killing Selonia Reed and was later sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Ward told Reggie that police believe Reginald likely murdered Selonia in their bedroom while Reggie slept. Detectives believe he then placed her body in her car and drove to the spot where it was found. Reginald's co-conspirator Jimmy Ray Barnes testified at trial that he met Reginald at the crime scene and saw Reginald in that car next to Selonia's body.",
      "To this day, Reggie continues to question his father's guilt.",
      "\"I want justice, but I didn't think justice was gonna come at the price of my dad going to prison for life,\" Reggie told Duthiers who asked: \"Do you believe that your father murdered your mother?\"",
      "\"I don't know \u2026 another question \u2014 do I think my dad had some involvement?\u202fMaybe. I don't know though. I don't know. So that's where I'm just, it's like a tug-of-war game.\"",
      "Reggie said he struggles to square what the state claims with the father he knew. Reggie appreciates that his father was loving to him, put him through private school and raised him to be the man he is today.",

      "So far this year, at least 712 measles cases have been confirmed in the U.S. \u2014 the second-highest number of cases reported in a single year since the 1990s. Nearly 30,000 measles cases were reported in 1990, largely due to gaps in vaccination.",
      "In 2019, there were 1,274 confirmed measles cases.",
      "The CDC said Friday there have been seven local outbreaks of the virus in the U.S., up from six last week. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring New Mexico remains the country's largest, with nearly 600 cases between the two states.",
      "A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, asked about the new outbreaks. The agency previously said outbreaks had been reported in Texas and New Mexico, New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.",
      "This week's update came a day after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described his strategy for handling the current outbreak as a success, even after a third death of an unvaccinated American was linked to it.",
      "\"Our numbers in this country have now plateaued. And I want to thank CDC for that,\" Kennedy said Thursday at a White House Cabinet meeting.",
      "Kennedy compared the nation's measles figures to those in Europe, which has seen thousands more measles cases and several more deaths. Health officials there have been grappling with record measles cases in recent years due to steep gaps in vaccination rates in several countries.",
      "Unlike in Europe, prolonged local outbreaks of measles had been declared eliminated in the Americas. Officials have warned that this year's outbreaks in the region are now threatening that public health achievement.",
      "Kennedy also told President Trump at the Cabinet meeting, \"We're trying to refocus the press. We've had three measles deaths in this country over 20 years, and we're trying to refocus the press to get them to pay attention to the chronic disease epidemic.\"",
      "One CDC official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, warned that any apparent slowdown in recent measles cases should be treated with caution. Challenges in quickly identifying and reporting cases from the outbreaks can distort figures.",
      "During outbreaks, weekly measles cases almost always appear to be lower in more recent weeks due to reporting delays, they said.",
      "Some travelers to Texas and Kansas are also now being advised to get a second or early dose of the measles vaccine, the CDC said in a letter to health departments this week, marking the first time in years that the CDC has published these kinds of vaccination recommendations for domestic travel within the country.",
      "\"The current increase in measles cases in the United States is due to people returning to the United States from international trips with measles and an expanding outbreak among communities with low vaccination coverage in Texas and other states,\" the CDC wrote in its letter.",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:27:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Recent cuts eliminated a small, specialized workforce that sets the poverty standards determining who is eligible for Medicaid as well as assistance with food, home heating, child care, and more.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's firings at the Department of Health and Human Services included the entire office that sets federal poverty guidelines, which determine whether tens of millions of Americans are eligible for health programs such as Medicaid, food assistance, child care, and other services, former staff said.",
      "The small team, with technical data expertise, worked out of HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. Their dismissal mirrored others across HHS, which came without warning and left officials puzzled as to why they were \"RIF'ed\" \u2014 as in \"reduction in force,\" the bureaucratic language used to describe the firings.",
      "\"I suspect they RIF'ed offices that had the word 'data' or 'statistics' in them,\" said one of the laid-off employees, a social scientist whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because the person feared further recrimination. \"It was random, as far as we can tell.\"",
      "Among those fired was Kendall Swenson, who had led development of the poverty guidelines for many years and was considered the repository of knowledge on the issue, according to the social scientist and two academics who have worked with the HHS team.",
      "The sacking of the office could lead to cuts in assistance to low-income families next year unless the Trump administration restores the positions or moves its duties elsewhere, said Robin Ghertner, the fired director of the Division of Data and Technical Analysis, which had overseen the guidelines.",
      "The poverty guidelines are \"needed by many people and programs,\" said Timothy Smeeding, a professor emeritus of economics at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. \"If you're thinking of someone you fired who should be rehired, Swenson would be a no-brainer,\" he added.",
      "Under a 1981 appropriations bill, HHS is required annually to take Census Bureau poverty-line figures, adjust them for inflation, and create guidelines that agencies and states use to determine who is eligible for various types of help.",
      "There's a special sauce for creating the guidelines that includes adjustments and calculations, Ghertner said. Swenson and three other staff members would independently prepare the numbers and quality-check them together before they were issued each January.",
      "Everyone in Ghertner's office was told last week, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said.",
      "\"There's literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,\" he said. \"And because we're all locked out of our computers, we can't teach anyone how to calculate them.\"",
      "ASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "HHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired.",
      "\"These workers were told they couldn't come into their offices so there's no transfer of knowledge,\" said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. \"They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.\"",
      "HHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE \"as part of Secretary Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,\"\u00a0 spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. \"Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office\" and \"HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,\" she said in a written response to KFF Health News.",
      "After this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF'ed data analysis team, which had nine members. \"The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,\" he said. \"Eighty million people will not be affected.\"",
      "Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency's lobby.",
      "The group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee \"and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.\"",
      "Matt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues.",
      "ASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi's senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies.",
      "\"These HHS staffing cuts \u2014 20,000 \u2014 obviously they are completely nuts,\" Primus said. \"These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There's no rhyme or reasons to what they're doing.\"",
      "HHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said.",
      "And sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four.",
      "\"If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn't buy you the same,\" he said, \"but if the guidelines haven't increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.\"",
      "The 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.",
      "As of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility.",
      "Eligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level.",
      "One in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility.",
      "Former employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration's objectives. \"We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,\" the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" rubric. \"Even if it didn't align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.\"",

    "story": [
      "Just over three months into 2025, the United States has recorded the most measles cases in a single year since a 2019 wave, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. The majority of the infections have been reported in an outbreak in West Texas that has led to\u00a0the deaths\u00a0of two children. The number of cases in Texas alone has grown to\u00a0more than 500, while cases nationwide have surpassed 700, with infections confirmed in at least 24 states.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in other states around the country as well.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Fridays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)",
      "The Texas outbreak is primarily affecting\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or have an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "The highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",
      "\"When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity),\" the CDC states.",

      "\"We encourage people to get the measles vaccine,\" Kennedy told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook in an interview April 8, marking the first time Kennedy has publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine since becoming HHS secretary.",
      "Asked by LaPook what the federal government's official position on the vaccine is, Kennedy reiterated, \"The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine,\" but added, \"The government should not be mandating those.\"",

      "When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote \"The Great Gatsby\" at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",
      "In fact, when Fitzgerald \u2013 a St. Paul, Minnesota native whose debut novel \"This Side of Paradise\" launched him into national prominence at the age of 24 \u2013 died in 1940 at the early age of 44, the book was already in danger of falling into obscurity.",
      "Now, 100 years after the book's first publication on April 10, 1925, it endures as one of the country's foremost tales of American hubris, modern yearning and class consciousness. And its clear-eyed assessment of the attainability of the American dream remains incisive with each passing decade.",
      "Fitzgerald's book, long a staple in high school literature classes, tells the story of Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner (and veiled Fitzgerald stand-in) who becomes enamored with the bon vivant, Jazz Age lifestyle on Long Island, specifically the effects of mutli-millioniare Jay Gatsby.",
      "Like Carraway, Gatsby is a Midwesterner who has trekked to the East Coast to make a name for himself. It's Carraway's cousin Daisy Buchanan who serves as the catalyst for Gatsby's downfall, and ultimately Carraway's own disillusionment. All the while, a symbolic green light beckons from the distance.",
      "When the book was first published, reviews were largely positive, though not unanimous. Fitzgerald, who originally wanted to title the book \"Trimalchio in West Egg\" before being persuaded to go with a title he thought far more generic, watched as the book languished on the vine commercially, selling fewer than 25,000 copies in the initial push.",
      "He would only complete one further novel in his lifetime: 1934's \"Tender is the Night,\" a thinly-veiled roman \u00e0 clef of Fitzgerald's own marriage to socialite Zelda Sayre, detailing their mutual descent into alcoholism and mental illness. Fitzgerald's early death from a heart attack was likely fuelled by years and years of alcohol abuse. Ironically, he'd gone sober just ahead of the cardiac event.",
      "If \"The Great Gatsby\" never achieved the level of esteem it now enjoys during the author's own life, it wasn't long after his death that Fitgerald's literary reputation took off.",
      "When the Modern Library asked authors, historians, critics and publishers on the eve of Y2K to rank their picks for the world's best novels of the 20th century, it was \"The Great Gatsby\" that\u00a0stood above all other U.S. contenders near the top of the poll. (The novel landed in second place, bookended by Irish author James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the top three.)",
      "The novel has since launched multiple film adaptations, has been transposed to the stage, and since going into the public domain in 2021, has been the subject of an endless array of reimaginings, remixes and mashups. It's even cleared space around itself as a modern-day meme, in the form of an animated .GIF depicting Leonardo Dicaprio (playing Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation) smirking as he offers a champagne toast flanked by ostentatious fireworks.",
      "Host of \"Gatsby\" centennial events planned in New York, Minnesota",
      "A host of \"Gatsby\"-themed events are planned to mark the novel's centennial anniversary. In New York, the Empire State Building announced plans to light up in green in a nod to the novel's symbolic green light at the end of Tom and Daisy's dock.",
      "There was also a rowdy \"Roaring Twenties\" party at the Empire Steak House in New York, which was an opulent opera house in Fitzgerald's era. Billed as the \"nation's most extravagant celebration,\" the event featured live jazz, period dancing, and speeches from officials with the New York Public Library.",
      "In honor of the legendary stage play, Broadway has marked the occasion with a release of new block tickets for the show. Tickets are on sale now and will run through Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "The iconic Victorian-themed New York bar, Oscar Wilde, is also hosting a Gatsby-inspired soir\u00e9e on Saturday. The event information markets the celebration as \"an all-day affair of music, opulence and mischief.\" Events kick off at 2 p.m. and continue into the evening until 11 p.m.",
      "Additionally, multiple restaurants are offering exclusive discounts on cocktails, and even a free drink at some places. Gatsby's Landing, Nothing Really Matters, Angelina Bakery and The Plaza are all listed as participants. All events and discounts are ongoing throughout the month of April.",
      "In Fitzgerald's hometown of St. Paul, the events include a new exhibit of the author's life and times at the Minnesota History Center, as well as various, less-than-sober events leaning into the novel's party-friendly Prohibition-era setting.",
      "If you managed to get through high school without having been assigned to read the book, there are a number of live readings of the book scheduled this month, including at St. Paul's Gale Family Library.",

      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At  VEG ER for Pets, this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG ER for Pets represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG ER for Pets focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Glattstein, co-founder and president of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG ER for Pets' most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals, where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Glattstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG ER for Pets has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG ER for Pets is now independently able to do that,\" Glattstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Glattstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Senate committee heard from several experts Thursday on setting a year-round time standard instead of switching back and forth with daylight saving time. President Trump recently called it a \"50/50 issue,\" but he previously vowed to get rid of daylight saving.",
      "At the hearing, the committee's chairman, Sen. Ted Cruz, said there is a general consensus among his colleagues that the system of switching the clocks needs to be changed, but he said there is disagreement about whether to adopt universal standard time or daylight saving time.",
      "\"I personally struggle with the two choices here, because it's a question of what do you care about more: sunshine and joy and fun and money, or health, mental health, physical health,\" said Cruz, a Republican from Texas. \"And the honest answer for most people, gosh, I care about all that stuff.\"",
      "Cruz said an alternative has been discussed to pick daylight saving time, but letting states opt out. Arizona and Hawaii current opt out of changing the clock. But others said in Thursday's hearing that having different standards for different states could cause widespread confusion.",
      "The Senate Commerce Committee hearing notice did not set a preference for daylight saving time or standard time, but instead said it would focus on \"various issues around whether the country should continue 'springing forward' and 'falling back' each year with time.\"",
      "Daylight saving time begins in March, when clocks are moved forward an hour, and ends in October, when the clocks go back to standard time.",
      "The twice-yearly time changes are\u00a0generally unpopular\u00a0among Americans, with 63% saying they\u00a0would like to eliminate\u00a0them completely, compared to just 16% who said they would not, according to an Economist/YouGov poll in November 2021.",
      "\"People across our country are tired of the constant cycle of falling back and springing forward,\" Democratic Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware said, calling it time for a \"thoughtful solution\" across the country.",
      "\"The important thing is that we land of something consistent and make smart investments to keep people safe,\" she said.",
      "\"Time is always complicated and the system we have is complicated, but it's complicated because it's a human creation,\" said Scott Yates, the founder of the Lock the Clock movement, which supports getting rid of twice-yearly time changes.",
      "\"The sun moving around the earth doesn't actually have anything to do with time,\" Yates said. \"We need this system, but this system has this bug right now, and the bug is daylight saving time, the switching of the clocks. And so if we have a little bit of time, a couple of years, so the individual states can address all of these complexities and make those decisions, then we will be able to get rid of this bug permanently. It is something we have been stuck with since World War I, and this is our opportunity to finally fix it.\"",

      "The third oldest president at his inauguration was Ronald Reagan, who was 69 when he was sworn in in 1981. \"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience,\" Reagan famously said in 1984 while running for reelection against Walter Mondale.",
      "In fourth place is the nation's ninth president, William Henry Harrison. Harrison was elected in 1841 at age 68, but his tenure as president was short-lived. He died 32 days into his first term, making his presidency the shortest in U.S. history.",
      "Who are the oldest living U.S. presidents?",
      "The oldest living president is Biden, who turned 82 on Nov. 20, 2024, just weeks after the election. Mr. Trump and two former presidents, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, all 78 years old, roughly tied for second.",

      "The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya.",
      "\"Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,\" study co-author Frido Welker told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery.",
      "The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.",
      "An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.",
      "While the new research is promising, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Project, said he would like to see further data before confirming the Taiwan fossil as Denisovan.",
      "Potts, who was not involved in the new research, praised the study for \"a fantastic job of recovering some proteins.\" But he added, such a small sliver of material may not give a full picture.",

      "\"Much of the swap was negotiated by the U.S. government, with CIA playing a key role engaging with Russian intelligence,\" a CIA spokesperson said Thursday, adding, \"The exchange shows the importance of keeping lines of communication open with Russia, despite the deep challenges in our bilateral relationship.\"",
      "Karelina was sentenced to 12 years in a Russian penal colony after pleading guilty to treason. She was arrested while on visit to Russia for donating about $51 to an American-based humanitarian group that was helping Ukrainians impacted by the war, according to Russian state media.",

Vice President JD Vance also admonished Zelensky: \"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting?\"",
      "The Trump administration subsequently paused military and intelligence aid to Ukraine amid the fallout. That intelligence support resumed once Ukraine agreed to go along with the Trump administration's outreach to Putin. Mr. Trump continues to sit on the nearly $4 billion in remaining U.S. military aid already designated for Ukraine. The U.S. has been a key supplier of weapons since the Russian invasion began.",

      "An altar from the Teotihuacan culture, at the pre-Hispanic heart of what became Mexico, was discovered in Tikal National Park in Guatemala, the center of Mayan culture, demonstrating the interaction between the two societies, Guatemala's Culture and Sports Ministry announced this week.",
      "The enormous city-state of Tikal, whose towering temples still stand in the jungle, battled for centuries with the Kaanul dynasty for dominance of the Maya world.",
      "Far to the north in Mexico, just outside present day Mexico City, Teotihuacan \u2014 \"the city of the gods\" or \"the place where men become gods\" \u2014 is best known for its twin Temples of the Sun and Moon. It was actually a large city that housed over 100,000 inhabitants and covered around 8 square miles.",
      "The still mysterious city was one of the largest in the world at its peak between 100 B.C. and A.D. 750. But it was abandoned before the rise of the Aztecs in the 14th century.",
      "Lorena Paiz, the archaeologist who led the discovery, said that the Teotihuacan altar was believed to have been used for sacrifices, \"especially of children.\"",
      "\"The remains of three children not older than 4 years were found on three sides of the altar,\" Paiz told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Teotihuacan were traders who traveled all over the country (Guatemala),\" Paiz said. \"The Teotihuacan residential complexes were houses with rooms and in the center altars; that's what the residence that was found is like, with an altar with the figure representing the Storm Goddess.\"",
      "Researchers posted video on social media showing aerial footage of the altar as well as detail of the structure's interior.",
      "\"It's something unique in Guatemala, nothing similar had been found,\" Paiz said in a statement.",
      "It took archaeologists 1\u00bd years to uncover the altar in a dwelling and analyze it before the announcement.",
      "Edwin Rom\u00e1n, who leads the South Tikal Archaeological Project within the park, said the discovery shows the sociopolitical and cultural interaction between the Maya of Tikal and Teotihuacan's elite between 300 and 500 A.D.",
      "Rom\u00e1n said the discovery also reinforces the idea that Tikal was a cosmopolitan center at that time, a place where people visited from other cultures, affirming its importance as a center of cultural convergence.",
      "Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n M\u00e9ndez, an archaeologist who was not involved with the project, said the discovery confirms \"that there has been an interconnection between both cultures and what their relationships with their gods and celestial bodies was like.\"",
      "\"We see how the issue of sacrifice exists in both cultures. It was a practice; it's not that they were violent, it was their way of connecting with the celestial bodies,\" she said.",
      "The altar is just over a yard wide from east to west and about 2 yards from north to south. It is about a yard tall and covered with limestone.",
      "The dwelling where it was found had anthropomorphic figures with tassels in red tones, a detail from the Teotihuacan culture, according to the ministry's statement.",
      "The\u00a0researchers published their findings in the archaeological journal Antiquity.",

      "Tikal National Park is about 325 miles north of Guatemala City, and the discovery site is guarded and there are no plans to open it to the public. Tikal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, reached its peak between 200 and 900 AD when Mayan culture encompassed parts of what are now Guatemala, Mexico, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras.",

    "summary": "Trump hit Europe with 20% tariffs, but a Virginia wholesaler says Americans could see 30% price hikes on some wines, and even U.S. producers face higher costs.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Producers and importers of alcoholic beverages say President Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs will hit many American drinkers right in the wallet, with price hikes on some favored tipples even exceeding the rates of the levies he's imposed.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump announced what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. does trade with. Despite stock markets around the globe descending into tumult and economists warning for months that it will be consumers who pay the price for the levies, Mr. Trump has not backed down, insisting the measures will help the U.S. balance its trade deficit with other nations in the longer term.",
      "But in the near term, many Americans' adult beverages of choice, including European wines and Scotch whisky, are likely to come at more of a premium, according to industry insiders.",
      "Bartholomew Broadbent, who owns the Virginia-based wine wholesaler and importer Broadbent Selections, warned the impact on retail prices in the U.S. is going to be \"a lot worse than people think.\"",
      "French wines, as an example, will be subject to 20% tariffs under the measures announced by Mr. Trump. But Broadbent told CBS News the real-world price increase will be closer to 30%, because the cost of the tariff will be compounded at every stage of a bottle or crate's journey to a store shelf \u2014 with producers in France and other nations, along with importers like himself and then distributors and retailers all adding their own mark-ups.",
      "\"The price is going to have to go up,\" he said.",
      "In real terms, Broadbent estimated that the retail price on a bottle of wine that currently sells for $9.99 could go up to $13 or $14.",
      "Broadbent, whose company imports wines from 11 different countries and it also works with wineries in California, said more than 80% of his business will now face new tariffs. Wines from South Africa will be the most heavily impacted, he said, as the White House has hit the country with a steep 30% tariff.",
      "\"I don't see a single person who can benefit from this,\" Broadbent said. \"Even the wineries in America will suffer badly because they're all buying barrels and corks from Europe.\"",
      "The tariffs sent shockwaves through the global wine industry, with France's Bourgogne Wine Board (BIVB) warning the levies risked \"pushing our wines past a psychological price threshold.\"",
      "Bourgogne \u2014 or the Burgundy region as it's known in English \u2014 exported nearly 21 million bottles of wine to the U.S. in 2024, according to the BIVB, which agreed with the assessment that Mr. Trump's tariffs will have a negative impact on everyone, from French exporters and their distributor partners to American consumers.",
      "\"The industry deeply regrets this decision,\" the BIVB said in a press release",
      "The people who make, sell and enjoy Scotland's world renowned distilled spirits are also staring down the barrel of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last year alone, about 132 million bottles of Scotch whisky were imported into the U.S. market, according to the Scotch Whisky Association.",
      "The mood in Scotland is one of \"frustration and uncertainty,\" according to Drew McKenzie Smith, who founded and runs the Lindores Abbey Distillery just north of Edinburgh.",
      "McKenzie Smith estimated that the 10% baseline tariff Mr. Trump imposed on the U.K. would see the price of a bottle of his Scotch hiked by about the same amount for American consumers. So a bottle that currently costs $60 will soon jump to $66, be believes.",
      "While that \"may not sound severe,\" McKenzie Smith told CBS News, \"it still adds a meaningful burden \u2014 especially for smaller producers like us.\"",
      "He said while larger Scotch whisky brands may be able to offset costs across multiple markets, but for smaller distilleries, the tariffs could mean devastation.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent William La Jeunesse joins 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss the evolution of AI and the push lawmakers are making to regulate it.",
      "The use of artifical intelligence to reimagine the classic film \"The Wizard of Oz\" will likely see mixed reactions from fans, experts told Fox News Digital.",
      "While \"film purists\" may resist the idea of using generative AI to give classic films an entire makeover, the technology could \"breathe new life\" into hit movies \u2014 including \"The Wizard of Oz.\"",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery, Google Cloud and Magnopus have set out to do just that by creating an immersive experience for fans of the 1939 classic. The new \"Wizard of Oz\" experience is set to premiere at the Las Vegas Sphere on Aug. 28.",
      "\"The fan reaction will likely split into two distinct camps,\" Michael Walker, CEO of AI-First at Trilogy, told Fox News Digital. \"Film purists will object \u2014 and they have valid concerns about artistic integrity. The original work represents specific creative choices by directors, cinematographers and set designers who worked within the constraints of their era. Expanding and reimagining with AI creates something fundamentally different from their vision.\"",

      "\"On the other hand, this represents an exciting new way to connect classic films with audiences who increasingly expect immersive experiences,\" he explained. \"The technology could breathe new life into works that might otherwise fade from cultural relevance.\"",
      "\"The Wizard of Oz\" was originally shot in four-by-three images on a 35mm film, but had to be transformed to fit the Las Vegas Sphere's 160,000-square-foot screen.",
      "The LED screen at Las Vegas Sphere wraps over and behind the audience \u2014 creating a problem when trying to transform the original film of the classic feature.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "\"Using versions of Veo, Imagen and Gemini specially tuned for the task, the Google teams and their partners developed an AI-based \u2018super resolution\u2019 tool to turn those tiny celluloid frames from 1939 into ultra-ultra-high definition imagery that will pop inside Sphere,\" according to a Google blog explaining the technology. \"Then, the teams perform AI outpainting, to expand the scope of scenes to both fill the space and fill in the gaps created by camera cuts and framing limitations. Finally, through performance generation, they\u2019re incorporating composites of those famed performances into the expanded environments. Together, these techniques help achieve the natural gestures, staging and fine details that conventional CGI struggles to match.\"",
      "Jim Dolan, executive chairman and CEO of Sphere Entertainment, said: \"When you have innovation like this, you don't always know where it's going to go. You have to be able to take a leap of faith. What you're going to see in \u2018The Wizard of Oz at Sphere\u2019 is clearly a leap of faith.\"",

      "\"The Wizard of Oz at Sphere\" is set to premiere on Aug. 28. (Moviestore/Shutterstock)",
      "Fans' reactions to this leap of faith will \"span the spectrum,\" Boon Chew, founder of CentaurLab.AI, told Fox News Digital: \"Some will be excited, others resistant. Predicting the majority reaction is tough, and in any case, popular opinion doesn\u2019t determine whether something is right or meaningful. Innovation isn't a democracy \u2014 it\u2019s a process of exploration.\"",
      "\"What truly matters is the outcome,\" Chew explained. \"If a reimagined classic resonates, its value will speak for itself. Dismissing it without seeing the result is less about merit and more about discomfort with change. A classic doesn\u2019t stop being a classic because it\u2019s expressed in a new way. In fact, the heart of a classic is its ability to endure, evolve, and inspire across generations. Some may say reimagining beloved films with AI is gimmicky or disrespectful. My take? Don\u2019t engage with the remake if it\u2019s not your thing \u2014 but let others explore and create. The only real line we shouldn\u2019t cross is legal or ethical: copyright, attribution and transparency.\"",
      "He continued: \"From an evolutionary standpoint, nothing should be frozen in time. Reimagining classics with generative AI opens up new doors \u2014 for education, storytelling and accessibility.\"",

      "Dr. Nick Norwitz, a study leader and independent researcher at the University of Oxford, noted that this is the first study to isolate very high LDL and ApoB as risk factors for heart disease.",

      "Dr. Ken Berry, a family physician and\u00a0diabetes specialist in Tennessee, was not involved in the research but shared his thoughts on what he described as a \"groundbreaking\" study.",
      "\"The study found no association between LDL-C, ApoB and progression of coronary plaque over one year using high-resolution CT angiography,\" he said to Fox News Digital.",

      "\"Or is it, as I suspect, just the latest popular lab test being used to scare people away from eating a proper human diet rich in saturated fat?\"",
      "Potential study limitations",
      "Dr. Bradley Serwer, a cardiologist and chief medical officer at VitalSolution, a Cincinnati-based company that offers cardiovascular and anesthesiology services to hospitals nationwide, reviewed the study and pointed out some potential limitations.",
      "\"The study\u2019s limited scope, involving a low-risk population over a short duration, renders it challenging to generalize findings to a broader, more vulnerable population,\" Serwer told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"However, if someone is metabolically healthy, has no plaque at baseline, and has elevated apoB and LDL levels alone, then the environment may not necessarily cause plaque to form over a one-year period.\"",
      "Routhenstein pointed to prior research showing that high LDL and apoB over years of someone\u2019s life, typically coupled with inflammation, insulin resistance and/or oxidative stress, can increase the risk of plaque development.",

      "Looking ahead",

      "Over time, people who clear their throat often may find themselves doing it even more because of muscle memory. (iStock)",

      "In February, the Trump administration's EPA announced it would take steps to get the money back, citing concerns over a lack of oversight related to how the money was being disbursed. In the announcement, new EPA administrator Lee Zeldin cited comments from a former Biden EPA political appointee, who described disbursements made through GGRF as akin to \"tossing gold bars off the Titanic,\" because Biden officials were allegedly trying to get money out the door before Trump took over.",

      "At just 13, Clara began experiencing uncontrollable seizures that baffled doctors. Initially misdiagnosed with anxiety and gallbladder issues, she even underwent unnecessary surgery before doctors finally identified the real culprit: epilepsy. But this wasn\u2019t just any epilepsy; Clara had multifocal epilepsy, a rare and severe form that resists all medication.",
      "\"Every night I would have seizures, up to 10, and it was just miserable,\" Clara said, recalling the years lost to her condition.",

The device, known as the\u00a0NeuroOne OneRF Ablation System, is the first of its kind FDA-cleared technology designed for both diagnosing and treating neurological disorders in one procedure.",
      "\"It took them maybe 30 minutes, and the longest part was setting up,\" Clara said about the procedure that transformed her life.",
      "Dr. Brin Freund, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, explained Clara\u2019s case in more detail:",
      "\"Clara has had a history of seizures that, unfortunately, were uncontrolled with medications. In these cases, surgery may be the only option to reduce and potentially cure the seizure disorder. After a thorough diagnostic evaluation, our group at Mayo Clinic Florida recommended implantation of electrodes (stereoelectroencephalography, or stereo EEG) in the brain to determine where her seizures were originating, in order to develop a surgical plan to treat them.",
      "\"Clara and her family were very much in agreement with this plan, given how debilitating her seizures had been and the failure to control her seizures with medications. Clara underwent implantation of NeuroOne electrodes in order to record seizure activity to determine where her seizures were arising from and then to potentially treat them by performing radiofrequency ablation in these areas.\"",

      "HOW ELON MUSK\u2019S NEURALINK BRAIN CHIP WORKS",
      "How NeuroOne\u2019s dual-function system works",
      "The NeuroOne system uses ultra-thin electrodes to pinpoint the exact source of seizures in the brain. Once identified, it employs radiofrequency energy to disrupt abnormal electrical signals in problematic brain tissue without permanently damaging surrounding areas. This dual functionality, diagnostic and therapeutic, is what sets it apart from traditional methods that require two separate surgeries.",
      "NeuroOne CEO Dave Rosa explained:",
      "\"What separates our technology from others is that our device can be used for both the diagnostic part \u2013 finding the area of the brain \u2013 and then ablating or destroying that tissue, all in the same hospitalization.\"",
      "He added that this approach minimizes patient risk by reducing the number of procedures and hospitalizations required.",
      "Freund emphasized this advantage:",
      "\"Stereo EEG electrodes provide the ability to localize seizure onset with excellent precision as long as the electrode implantation is planned thoroughly and accurately. With regards to the NeuroOne electrodes, they allow for radiofrequency ablation to be performed while the electrodes are still implanted without having to remove them. We can therefore not only localize the seizure onset but provide a surgical treatment and potentially avoid a second and potentially more extensive or invasive procedure such as a craniotomy and resection of brain tissue.",
      "\"The NeuroOne electrodes allow us to control the conditions of the ablative procedure. They also provide us more confidence that the electrodes will withstand the duration of the implantation, which would include recording seizure data, performing the ablation and then recording more data after the ablation to ensure that the treatment achieved the intended goal.\"",
      "Brain implant patient Clara Fuller (NeuroOne)",
      "THIS MIND-READING TECH USING AI CAN CONVERT BRAIN ACTIVITY INTO TEXT",
      "The results",
      "The results have been nothing short of life-changing for Clara. Since undergoing the procedure, she has been completely seizure-free. She\u2019s now back to enjoying school, sports and uninterrupted sleep \u2013 things most people take for granted but were once unimaginable for her.",
      "According to Freund:",
      "\"Regarding the implantation itself, she did very well and there were no adverse effects. The first ablation did not cause any acute complications. We then performed a second ablation a few days later after data was recorded from the electrodes demonstrating ongoing seizure activity to ensure that her seizures would not recur. This was also well-tolerated without complications. We have now followed up months after the electrodes were removed and there have been no signs of ill effects due to the implantation or the ablations. She has been seizure-free since the ablation and has done amazingly well.\"",
      "Clara\u2019s story offers hope for others living with drug-resistant epilepsy, which affects about one-third of the 3 million Americans with epilepsy. According to Rosa, \"The desire to expand ablation therapy to patients suffering from seizures that do not respond to drug therapy was our driving force.\"",
      "NeuroOne One RF Ablation System (NeuroOne)",
      "A broader impact on medicine",
      "NeuroOne\u2019s innovative technology isn\u2019t just limited to epilepsy treatment. The company plans to expand its applications to other areas, such as pain management for facial pain and lower back pain, using the same RF ablation technology. Rosa also sees potential for treating neurological conditions beyond epilepsy:\u00a0\"Pain management appears to be the largest opportunity outside of brain ablation.\"",
      "Dr. Freund believes this technology could dramatically improve long-term care for pediatric epilepsy patients like Clara:",
      "\"This technology could allow for limiting the number of procedures that are required to treat drug-resistant focal epilepsy and also provide immediate feedback as to whether or not a surgical treatment was effective. This could potentially reduce the risk of adverse events by limiting the number of times that a brain surgery would be needed. This technology also allows us to access deeper parts of the brain to provide surgical treatment.\"",
      "He added that the impact may soon be widespread:",
      "\"In our practice, we are now using these electrodes in every case that requires Stereo EEG for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. I think as these types of electrodes are used at more centers and they get more experience, there would be no reason not to use them.\"",

      "How it happens",
      "Even if a new credit card hasn\u2019t arrived yet, it may already be vulnerable. In many cases, the issue isn\u2019t about the card being physically stolen but about someone gaining access to your information digitally. Criminals can exploit online account features, mobile wallets or leaked personal data to start using your card before you\u2019ve even opened the envelope. Below are some of the most common ways this type of fraud happens.",
      "If a scammer already has access to your account, either through stolen login credentials, a hacked email or\u00a0malware, they can view the newly issued card number in the online dashboard or mobile app. Many credit card companies now allow instant access to digital card numbers for use in Apple Pay, Google Wallet or online purchases. This means that as soon as a new card is issued, it may be visible digitally before the physical card is even shipped. If a fraudster has access to your account, they can add the number to a digital wallet and begin spending before the envelope ever hits your mailbox.",
      "Some card issuers allow you to add your credit card to mobile wallets instantly, even before the physical card arrives. While this feature is convenient, it can also expose you to specific security risks tied to mobile wallet activation. Criminals may exploit this process by using stolen personal information to bypass security checks and add your card to their own Apple Pay or Google Wallet accounts. They might pose as you to request a new card, intercept or reroute the digital activation process, or even start making fraudulent purchases immediately. This type of fraud can be hard to detect, especially if you're not expecting a new card or if unauthorized charges blend in with legitimate transactions.",

      "THIS IS HOW TO PROTECT YOUR CREDIT AND BANK CARDS FROM GETTING HACKED",
      "Another common scenario involves your personal information being compromised in a\u00a0phishing attack or large-scale\u00a0data breach. Thieves use this stolen data, such as your name, Social Security number, address and security question answers, to impersonate you and gain access to your account dashboard or reset login credentials. Once inside, they can retrieve new card details directly from the source or request a replacement card. Phishing scams often trick victims into revealing sensitive information through fake emails or websites, while data breaches expose vast amounts of personal data that criminals can exploit for fraudulent activities.",
      "Although charges made before a new credit card is received are rarely due to mail theft, this type of traditional fraud still poses a risk. Criminals may intercept your mail to steal sensitive documents, including credit cards, which can then be used for unauthorized purchases. To reduce this risk, avoid leaving important mail unattended in your mailbox. Consider using\u00a0Informed Delivery by USPS to track incoming mail or request that your credit card be delivered to a secure location, such as a P.O. box or directly to your bank branch.",

      "5. Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using a personal data removal service to reduce your online exposure. These services continuously monitor and remove your sensitive information from data brokers and websites that could be exploited by criminals. This lowers the chances of your data being used in phishing scams or other fraudulent activities. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Ask your credit card company to investigate:\u00a0Contact your credit card provider directly and request a full investigation. Ask if there was any suspicious account activity, such as a login from a new device, before the fraudulent charges occurred. They may be able to trace when and how your account was accessed. Most card issuers will reverse fraudulent charges and can reissue a new card with a different number.",
      "7. Notify law enforcement:\u00a0File a report with the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. If necessary, a police report should also be filed to document the fraud. This can be helpful for disputing charges and clearing your record.",

      "X app on an iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The X data leak is believed to stem from a combination of breaches, including a massive one that allegedly occurred in January 2025 and another in 2023. The leaked dataset, reportedly a 34 GB CSV file, contains 201,186,753 entries with information such as X screen names, user IDs, full names, locations, email addresses (from the 2023 breach), follower counts, profile data, time zones and profile images.",
      "ThinkingOne claimed that the data was cross-referenced from a larger breach involving 2.8 billion unique Twitter IDs and screen names. This breach may have been linked to an insider job during layoffs at X, although the company has not verified this claim. Cybersecurity researchers, including those from\u00a0Safety Detectives, partially confirmed the authenticity of the data by matching a sample with public X profiles and verifying some email addresses. However, they were not able to fully confirm ownership.",
      "The breach appears to trace back to a vulnerability identified in January 2022 through Twitter\u2019s bug bounty program. This flaw allowed attackers to access user data using only an email address or phone number. Although the vulnerability was patched, the compromised data seems to have resurfaced in later leaks.",

      "If you have an account on X or think your data may have been part of the breach, here are seven important steps you can take to protect yourself.",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software",
      "This breach included email addresses linked to X accounts, prime fuel for phishing attacks. Hackers may now send emails that look like they\u2019re from X, Musk or support, asking you to \"verify your account\" or \"reset your password.\" These often contain links or attachments that can install malware or steal personal data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Remove your personal data from the internet",
      "Since this X leak exposed full names, email addresses and other public-facing profile details, hackers can easily cross-reference it with other data broker sites to build a full profile on you. This could lead to impersonation or spear-phishing.",
      "To reduce your exposure, use a trusted data removal service that scans data broker websites and requests the deletion of your personal information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Change your X account password",
      "Even though this particular breach may not have included passwords, there\u2019s still a significant risk, especially if you use the same password across multiple platforms. Once attackers have your email, they often try using it with common or previously leaked passwords to break into accounts.",
      "To change your X account password, go to Settings and privacy from your profile menu, then select\u00a0Your account and tap on\u00a0Change your password. Enter your current password, set a new strong password and confirm the change. You can do this via the mobile app or by logging in through the web. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Make your X profile more private to reduce future risk",
      "Adjust your X account's privacy settings to limit the visibility of personal information, such as making your profile private. Ensure that only necessary information is publicly visible. Information that seems harmless, like your location, job title or birthday, can be used by cybercriminals to impersonate you or guess your login credentials. If your X profile includes any personal details that aren\u2019t necessary, now is the time to remove them.",
      "Keeping your profile minimal not only protects your privacy but also makes it harder for scammers to craft convincing phishing messages or social engineering attacks. Think twice before posting personal updates or details publicly, especially if they can be used to guess passwords or verify your identity.",
      "Go to\u00a0Settings > Privacy and safety and lock down your account visibility.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your X and email accounts",
      "If hackers got your email from the X breach, they may try to reset your password.\u00a02FA helps stop this by requiring a second code to log in:",
      "Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS, which can be interceptedSecure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",
      "Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS, which can be intercepted",
      "Secure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",
      "6) Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi",
      "Protect your data when accessing X or other platforms on public networks by using a VPN to encrypt your connection. This will help safeguard your information from being intercepted by malicious actors. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7) Sign up for identity theft protection to catch if your X-linked info is abused",
      "With 200-plus million names and email addresses exposed, scammers may try opening accounts in your name or use your email in fraud attempts. Good identity protection can alert you if your info is being sold on the dark web. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my\u00a0tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "NEW PHISHING SCAM OUTSMARTS SECURITY CODES TO STEAL YOUR INFO",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The X breach is yet another reminder that patching a vulnerability is only one piece of a much larger puzzle. The persistence of leaked data \u2013 years after the original flaw was disclosed and fixed \u2013 highlights the long tail of exposure that comes with large-scale breaches. Even when credentials aren\u2019t involved, the combination of identifiers like email addresses, names and social connections can be weaponized through correlation attacks, data enrichment and AI-assisted social engineering.",

      "\"It's a question of what's the appropriate punishment, given the life experiences of the person, everything they went through and the reasons why things ended up as they did, with really tragic crimes being committed,\" Weiss said. \"But almost without exception, what you see is when tragic crimes are committed, the person who committed them also went through incredibly difficult life experiences that led them down that path. And that's what happened here.\"",
      "SECOND SOUTH CAROLINA INMATE CHOOSES EXECUTION BY FIRING SQUAD",
      "Mikal Mahdi, 42, is set to be executed on Friday at 6 p.m. at a prison in Columbia. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP)",
      "Mahdi is a \"much different person\" now than when he committed the capital crimes at age 21, Weiss said, saying that his client was a \"confused, angry kid\" at the time who has since grown up and matured a lot. Weiss explained that Mahdi is now an \"intelligent, thoughtful person who spends as much time as he can reading and learning about the world.\"",
      "Weiss said Mahdi accepts responsibility for what he did and knows what he did was horrible. He said Mahdi understands that he must be punished for his crimes and that he could be executed.",
      "But Weiss warned that if South Carolina carries out the execution, it will be killing someone who is a \"very different person from the person who committed the capital crimes in the first place.\"",
      "Mahdi would be the fifth person to be executed by firing squad in the U.S. since 1976 \u2013 with the first three carried out in Utah \u2013 and the second in South Carolina after Brad Sigmon, 67, was put to death using that method last month. Sigmon was the first person to be executed by firing squad in 15 years.",
      "Given the choice of lethal injection, electrocution and firing squad, Weiss said Mahdi chose the lesser of three evils. He noted that lethal injection was previously believed to be more humane before it was later determined to be \"quite torturous\" and that electrocution is cruel since a person is being \"cook[ed] from the inside out.\"",
      "\"If the execution goes through, they're going to fire three high-powered rifles at our client's chest,\" Weiss said. \"It's a horrible thing for him to go through. It's a horrible thing to have to witness for everybody involved, from the legal team to witnesses to prison staff who have to carry it out.\"",
      "In the death chamber, Mahdi will be strapped to a chair and have a hood over his head and a target over his heart. Three shooters will fire at him through a small opening about 15 feet away.",
      "Bo King, a lawyer who represented Sigmon, detailed what he witnessed when his client was put to death on March 7.",
      "\"Seeing how he was restrained, he was tied to the chair with his arms pulled back far enough, almost as if someone had him in a wrestling hold, holding his arms behind his back. And then with his chin and jaw secured to the chair with some kind of strap,\" King told Fox News Digital.",
      "SOUTH CAROLINA SETS DATE FOR 5th EXECUTION IN UNDER 7 MONTHS",
      "Brad Sigmon was executed in March for beating to death his estranged girlfriend\u2019s parents in Greenville County in 2001. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP)",
      "\"What has stayed with me and continues to trouble me is how he reacted after being shot, specifically watching his right arm pull so frantically on the straps, tying it to the chair,\" he continued. \"And every muscle in his arm popped out, and it looked like an anatomical drawing. It just looked like he was trying so desperately to pull his arm free and cover the hole in his chest.\"",
      "King said he remembers watching the wound open in the middle of Sigmon's chest.",
      "\"It's a difficult sight to reconcile in real time,\" he said. \"You're watching it happening. You're thinking, I just saw a hole open up in that person.\"",
      "King also explained that he believes it is inhumane to tie someone down to kill them, emphasizing that \"the amount of damage that I saw done to Brad's body is beyond anything that I would consider.\"",
      "Three other prisoners have been put to death in South Carolina since the state resumed executions in September. Freddie Owens on Sept. 20, Richard Moore on Nov. 1 and Marion Bowman Jr. on Jan. 31 all died by lethal injection. Sigmon chose the firing squad due to concerns about the prolonged suffering the three other inmates had faced when they were killed by lethal injection, King said.",
      "In Mahdi's case, Weiss expressed concern that his client would be executed \"even though he never had the fair trial that the Constitution is supposed to guarantee.\"",
      "\"The whole question at his trial was what punishment did he deserve? In order to make a reasoned decision about that, the trial judge needed to be given all the information about who Mikal was, what he went through in his life, tragically,\" Weiss explained.",
      "Earlier this week, South Carolina's highest court rejected a final appeal from Mahdi's lawyers. His lawyers argued that his original attorneys made a poor case in attempting to spare his life and failed to call on relatives, teachers or other people who knew him in his sentencing defense, but the state Supreme Court ruled that many of those same arguments had been made in previous unsuccessful appeals.",
      "During his trial, Mahdi\u2019s lawyers said their client was the second son of a woman who was wedded in an arranged marriage at 16 years old. His family described a chaotic childhood, although nobody testified about abuse or mental illness.",
      "Weiss told Fox News Digital that the trial judge who handed down the sentence was given very little information and Mahdi's defense called a single witness who testified for just a few minutes, giving only a broad outline of Mahdi's \"extraordinarily traumatic childhood\" that began when he was a toddler and extended through his early adolescent years.",
      "\"When he needed additional support at school, the teachers tried to provide it, but his dad pulled him out of school rather than allowing him to get that support for his depression, for his suicidal feelings and things just spiraled from there where he went into the juvenile prison system for fairly minor crimes, and he ends up spending thousands of hours in solitary confinement as a kid,\" Weiss said.",
      "As early as second grade, Mahdi suffered from mental despair and discussed self-harm. He already had a criminal record by the time he was a teenager, spending weeks in solitary confinement after being convicted of breaking and entering and attacking a police officer in Virginia.",
      "\"We know today in a way that we just didn't appreciate back then when Mikal was in the system, how damaging that is to a person's development,\" he continued. \"And the judge who decided what sentence Mikal should have was told almost nothing about his story.\"",

      "This photo provided by the South Carolina Department of Corrections shows the state's death chamber in Columbia, including the electric chair, right, and a firing squad chair, left. (South Carolina Department of Corrections/AP)",
      "Weiss added: \"That's the real injustice here, and that's the real outrage here.\"",
      "Mahdi stole a gun and a car in Virginia on July 14, 2004, arrest records show. The next day, he shot and killed a North Carolina store clerk as the clerk was checking his identification. A couple of days later, he carjacked someone at an intersection in Columbia, South Carolina.",
      "On July 18, 2004, while on the run after those crimes, Mahdi hid in the shed of Orangeburg, South Carolina, public safety officer James Myers. Mahdi ambushed Meyers when the officer returned from a birthday celebration for his wife, sister and daughter, prosecutors said.",
      "Myers, 56, was shot eight or nine times, including twice in the head after falling to the ground. A pathologist testified that at least seven of the shots would have been fatal.",
      "Mahdi then set Myers' body on fire and ran away. Myers' wife discovered her husband's dead body in the shed, which they had used for the backdrop of their wedding.",
      "On July 21, 2004, Mahdi was taken into custody in Florida. When one of the officers involved in his arrest learned what he was wanted for in South Carolina, he thanked Mahdi for not shooting at him. Mahdi told him that the only reason he did not was because he was skeptical that he could successfully shoot two officers and their K-9 and get away with it.",
      "While behind bars, Mahdi was caught three times with tools he could have used to escape. One was an Allen wrench and the others were homemade handcuff keys, including one that was found under his tongue at his trial.",
      "On death row, Mahdi stabbed a guard and struck another worker with a concrete block. On three occasions, prison staff found sharpened metal in his cell that could be used as a knife.",
      "After he pleaded guilty to murder, Mahdi was sentenced by Judge Clifton Newman, who at the time told The Post and Courier that he was not sure he believed in the death penalty, but the case became bigger than his beliefs.",
      "\"My challenge and my commitment throughout my judicial career has been to temper justice with mercy and to seek to find the humanity in every defendant that I sentence,\" Newman said as he handed down Mahdi\u2019s punishment. \"That sense of humanity seems not to exist in Mikal Deen Mahdi\"",
      "Once one of the busiest for executions, South Carolina resumed executions in September after a 13-year pause caused in part by the state having difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs due to pharmaceutical companies' concerns that they would have to disclose they had sold the drugs to state officials.",
      "The room where inmates are executed in Columbus, South Carolina. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP)",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The state legislature then passed a shield law allowing officials to keep lethal injection drug suppliers private. The legislature also approved the firing squad as another execution method over difficulties obtaining the drugs.",
      "South Carolina has executed 47 inmates since the death penalty was resumed in the U.S. in 1976. In the early 2000s, the state was carrying out an average of three executions per year. Only nine states have killed more inmates.",
      "If Mahdi runs out of legal appeals, including petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to review the issues in the state high court's ruling, his only remaining option would be for Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to reduce his sentence to life without parole, which Mahdi's lawyers have already requested. But no South Carolina governor has granted clemency in the 49 years since the death penalty resumed in the U.S.",
      "\"I think Gov. McMaster has an opportunity to change that, and he should change it,\" Weiss said.",
      "A spokesperson for McMaster's office confirmed to Fox News Digital that the governor had received the petition from Mahdi's lawyers asking for clemency.",
      "\"As the governor has done previously, he will review and carefully consider the petition,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Fox News Digital has reached out to the South Carolina Department of Corrections for comment."

      "The fate of the Menendez brothers is one step closer to a decision as the possibility of being freed from prison could soon become a reality.",
      "A judge will consider Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman\u2019s request to withdraw his predecessor George Gascon\u2019s motion to resentence Erik\u00a0and Lyle Menendez\u00a0on Friday, days before their resentencing hearing is set to take place.",
      "Friday's hearing is set for 10 a.m. local time, when the brothers are expected to appear remotely.",
      "Hochman announced on Wednesday that his office has filed a reply on the resentencing matter, saying he does not agree with the resentencing, but is prepared to move forward. The brothers' attorneys have argued they should have been convicted of manslaughter rather than murder, in which case they would already have been released from prison.",

      "Incoming Los Angeles County DA Nate Hochman says he hasn't seen any of the media about the Menendez brothers before he assumes office. (Getty Images)",
      "Hochman's office said that after \"a thorough and exhaustive review of over tens of thousands of pages of trial transcripts, thousands of pages of prison records, and hundreds of hours of videotaped trial testimony,\" his office is prepared to move forward with the hearing on the Court\u2019s initiation of resentencing proceedings for the Menendez brothers, but are requesting that the prior District Attorney\u2019s motion for resentencing be withdrawn.",
      "Joseph Menendez, who goes by his middle name Lyle, and younger brother Erik Menendez have been in California prisons since 1996, serving sentences of life without the possibility of parole for their parents' 1989 slayings.",
      "Before losing his bid for reelection in November, former district attorney George Gascon asked the court to\u00a0resentence the brothers\u00a0to life with parole instead of the current sentence of life without the possibility of parole.",
      "Hochman has opposed resentencing, but said his office is ready to proceed with the resentencing hearing, which he said could still happen even if the judge agrees to withdraw the Gascon motion.",

      "\"At the end of the day, I think the judge is going to grant Hochman's request to remove Gascon motion to support resentencing, but what we really need to have is a ruling by the trial judge,\" Claypool explained. \"So in other words, it doesn't matter really what the LA County DA says, whether it's Hochman's position or the prior DA Gascon's decision. It's ultimately up to this judge to make a decision on resentencing, irrespective of what Hochmon is requesting to be done.\"",
      "Two of the brothers' older relatives had already provided testimony at a November hearing as a precaution and the only relative against the brother's release, their uncle Milton Anderson, died last month at age 90.",
      "Subject to the court\u2019s ruling, a resentencing hearing is tentatively scheduled for April 17 and 18. If that goes forward, prosecutors are expecting the defense to call several Menendez family members who support resentencing.",
      "The hearing was postponed due to the impact of recent wildfires on the parties' extensive preparations.",
      "Claypool, who is based in Los Angeles County, believes that resentencing hearing is \"a political tug-of-war\" between Hochman and Gov. Gavin Newsom, more than anything else.",
      "\"The reason I say that is because Gavin Newsom has already requested weeks ago that the California Parole Board conduct what's called a risk assessment on the Menendez brothers. Why is that important? Because that portends that Newsom is likely to grant clemency if this judge doesn't grant resentencing. And in many respects, I believe that Newsom did that on purpose to put some implied pressure on this judge to grant resentencing,\" Claypool said.",
      "Hochman's office has said that despite the \"defense arguing that this decision is political, such an argument is devoid of merit.\"",
      "\"Though this pathway to resentencing has been offered to the Menendez brothers, they have chosen to stubbornly remain hunkered down in their over 30-year-old bunker of lies, deceit, and denials.\"",
      "\"The basis for this withdrawal request is that the prior DA\u2019s motion did not examine or consider whether the Menendez brothers have exhibited full insight and taken complete responsibility for their crimes by continuing for the past over 30 years to lie about their claims of self-defense, that is, their fear that their mother and father were going to kill them the night of Aug. 20, 1989, justifying the brutal murders of their parents with shotgun blasts through the back of their father\u2019s head, a point-blank blast through their mother\u2019s face, and shots to their kneecaps to stage it as a Mafia killing,\" Hochman said.",
      "\"As a full examination of the record reveals, the Menendez brothers have never come clean over the past three decades and admitted that they lied about their self-defense as well as suborned perjury and attempted to suborn perjury by their friends for the lies, among others, of their father violently raping Lyle\u2019s girlfriend, their mother poisoning the family, and their attempt to get a handgun the day before the murders.\"",
      "FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X",
      "Hochman's office also told Fox News Digital that this has nothing to do with politics and that there is \"no political tug-of-war between the DA and the Governor.\"",
      "\"Politics was one of the chief driving forces behind the timing of the prior District Attorney's decision to file a resentencing motion in the Menendez case, coming 12 days before the election instead of eight months earlier when he first received the resentencing request,\" Hochman said.",
      "\"The facts and the law \u2014 not politics \u2014 are now what drives DA Hochman\u2019s request to withdraw that motion as laid out in detail in the over 85-page response filed on March 10, 2025. There is no political tug-of-war between the DA and the Governor. The DA has done his job involving a thorough and detailed review of the facts and the law, and the DA assumes the Governor will honor his similar obligations.\"",
      "Hochman has said that it is up to the court to factor in whether the \"lack of acceptance of responsibility for their murderous actions\" is enough to decide whether the Menendez brothers pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the community.",
      "\"Though this pathway to resentencing has been offered to the Menendez brothers, they have chosen to stubbornly remain hunkered down in their over 30-year-old bunker of lies, deceit, and denials,\" Hochman said.",
      "MENENDEZ BROTHERS RESENTENCING: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?",
      "Claypool said he believes that Hochman knows deep down that they will lose this battle due to the \"public sentiment flowing in favor of the Menendez brothers getting a second chance.\"",
      "\"Hochman has to come out and vigorously oppose this because that is his mantra. That is his campaign message, but I think deep down he knows that it's not about winning or losing right now, for Hochman, it's about where does he stand politically on this issue,\" Claypool shared.",

      "\"Erik and Lyle have apologized, taken responsibility, and expressed sincere remorse, again and again, with no underlining motive other than to grow, mature, and rehabilitate,\" said Tamara Goodell, cousin of Erik and Lyle Menendez. \"They recognize the wide-scale impact their actions have had on us, their family. Since then, we have seen their relentless commitment to emotional growth, earning degrees and uplifting those around them. That is the definition of rehabilitation in my eyes.\"",

In late March, four Taiwanese soldiers, three of whom were part of a unit that provides security for Taiwan\u2019s Presidential Office, were jailed for up to seven years after being convicted of selling pictures of sensitive information to China.",
      "The verdicts came after last month\u2019s speech in which Lai condemned the\u00a0Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the harshest terms used by a Taiwanese leader in modern history. In his remarks, the president said Taiwan will not be \"bullied or manipulated\" and promised repercussions against those who make \"expressions of loyalty to the enemy.\"",
      "Lai, aware of Beijing\u2019s \"carrot and stick\" campaign, warned Taiwanese to be wary of China\u2019s \"United Front,\"\u00a0a political strategy employed by the CCP in which they \u2013 with plenty of smiles and often \"investment\" capital \u2013 enter international organizations and various influential groups and plant agents who then build alliances with targeted individuals, political parties and other interests.",

      "\"This is the one time that we have the ability to sort of put new sanctions on Iran where we don't need Russia and China's help, and we can just do it unilaterally,\" Gabriel Noronha of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America told Fox News Digital.

      "The provision for snapback sanctions was enacted under UNSC Resolution 2231, which was agreed to just days after the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed in 2015 as a way to ensure that if Iran was found to be violating the nuclear deal, stiff international sanctions could once again be reimposed.",
      "The JCPOA has increasingly been considered a collapsed agreement after the U.S. withdrew in 2018 under the first Trump administration, followed by increasingly flagrant violations by Iran of the nuclear deal.",
      "This has culminated in the rapid expansion of Tehran\u2019s nuclear program and the assessment by the U.N. nuclear watchdog earlier this year that Tehran had amassed enough near-weapons-grade uranium to develop five nuclear weapons if it were to be further enriched.",
      "Centrifuge machines are shown in the Natanz uranium enrichment facility in central Iran in 2019. (Atomic Energy Organization of Iran via AP)",

But the U.S., which has been calling for snapbacks since 2018, was found by the U.N. and all JCPOA members to no longer be legally eligible to utilize the sanction mechanism after its withdrawal from the international agreement.",
      "But as Iran continues to develop its nuclear program, the tone among European leaders has also become increasingly frustrated.",

      "\"It takes about\u00a0six weeks to actually be implemented properly,\" said Noronha, author of \"Iran Sanctions, U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, and the Path to Snapback,\" which was released last week. \"And second, because the distribution of the presidencies and leadership of the U.N. Security Council is weighted towards more favorable leaders right now in the spring before it goes to pretty adversarial leadership in the summer and fall.\"",

      "A single veto is enough to block a resolution being enacted, and progress in the council has become stagnant following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "But even if Russia objects to reimposing sanctions on Iran, as Tehran has become a close ally of Moscow\u2019s, it actually has very few options for blocking the snapback mechanism that it previously agreed to, so long as at least one other nation actually calls for the sanction tool.",

      "\"This is the only time this has ever happened at the U.N. before,\" Noronha said. \"They basically said, when we invoke snapback, what it does is it says U.N. sanctions will automatically return unless there's a vote by the council to unanimously allow sanctions relief to remain on the books.\"",
      "The snapback mechanism would legally enforce all 15 UNSC member nations to reimpose sanctions on Iran, including Russia and any nation that may be sympathetic to Tehran.",
      "If the snapback mechanism expires come October, the U.N.\u2019s hands will likely be tied when it comes to countering Iran\u2019s nuclear program, as it is unlikely any new resolutions on the issue will be able to pass through the council given the current geopolitical climate between the West and Russia.",

      "The Supreme Court intervened this week in a number of cases involving President Donald Trump's efforts to dramatically transform the government, maintaining legal guardrails for deportations while also allowing the administration to continue with mass firings of federal workers.",
      "In all, the high court took action in four pivotal cases, while another federal appeals court gave the green light to more federal layoffs.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the biggest legal developments of the last week:",
      "Mixed ruling in Alien Enemies Act case",
      "In a ruling Monday, the Supreme Court threw out a judge\u2019s nationwide decision temporarily blocking the removal of people alleged to be members of the Venezuelan gang\u00a0Tren de Aragua\u00a0under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Trump and his allies had complained bitterly about U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's temporary restraining order last month barring deportations under the rarely used wartime law, even going as far as suggesting the judge should be impeached.",
      "Boasberg had issued the order after the lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case had argued some of those being sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador weren't gang members at all, and were being whisked away without any due process.",
      "The Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling said legal challenges should be heard in the districts where the individual detainees are being held, an argument the government had made, but also said that the detainees must be given due process moving forward.",
      "\u201cAEA detainees must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,\u201d the court wrote in its unsigned\u00a0majority opinion.",
      "In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said her colleagues shouldn't have blocked Boasberg's order and should not reward the administration for having disregarded the initial deportees' due process rights.",
      "\"The Government\u2019s conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law. That a majority of this Court now rewards the Government for its behavior with discretionary equitable relief is indefensible. We, as a Nation and a court of law, should be better than this,\" she wrote.",
      "Order to 'facilitate' return of mistakenly deported man",
      "The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the administration to \"facilitate\" the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the Justice Department has acknowledged was mistakenly sent to the El Salvador prison on March 15.",
      "\"The United States acknowledges that Abrego Garcia was subject to a withholding order forbidding his removal to El Salvador, and that the removal to El Salvador was therefore illegal,\" the ruling said.",
      "Despite the government's acknowledgement, it has not disclosed any efforts to return him to the U.S. or to move him to another country, maintaining he was out of its control now that he's in El Salvador.",
      "The administration has alleged that Garcia, who grew up in El Salvador, is a member of the gang MS-13, an allegation his attorneys have denied. They\u2019ve also noted that he has no criminal record in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis last week ordered Garcia to be\u00a0returned to the U.S.\u00a0by Monday night \u2014 a decision that the high court paused while it reviewed the case.",
      "At a hearing before Xinis on Friday, a lawyer for the Justice Department said he had no information about what efforts the administration had made to get Garcia back, and no information about his current whereabouts.",
      "\"This is extremely troubling,\" the judge said.",
      "She ordered the government to give her daily updates. The attorney for the Justice Department, Drew Ensign, said he anticipated having some answers for her by April 15.",
      "You're fired, again",
      "On Tuesday, the Supreme Court halted a\u00a0federal judge\u2019s ruling\u00a0requiring several federal agencies to reinstate around 16,000 probationary workers the Trump administration had sought to fire.",
      "William Alsup, a federal judge in California, last month ordered the administration to reinstate the probationary workers \u2014 generally employees with less than two years on the job or workers who were recently promoted to new positions.",
      "Alsup found the administration hadn't followed proper procedures for mass layoffs and had falsely claimed the workers were canned due to performance issues.",
      "\u201cIt is sad, a sad day when our government would fire some good employee, and say it was based on performance, when they know good and well, that\u2019s a lie,\u201d Alsup said, calling the move \u201ca sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court, however, found Alsup's ruling lacked the proper legal footing.",
      "\"The District Court\u2019s injunction was based solely on the allegations of the nine non-profit-organization plaintiffs in this case. But under established law, those allegations are presently insufficient to support the organizations\u2019 standing,\" the ruling said.",
      "The decision said other claims in the case can move forward, but paused Alsup's order reinstating the workers until the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals fully hears and weighs in on the issue.",
      "Appeals court green-lights thousands more firings",
      "On Wednesday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals halted a similar but broader order in a Maryland case where the government had been directed to\u00a0rehire\u00a0around\u00a024,000\u00a0probationary workers.",
      "\u201cThe Government is likely to succeed in showing the district court lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 claims,\u201d\u00a0the 2-1 ruling\u00a0by the appeals court said, staying an order last month that the workers be rehired at least temporarily.",
      "The panel said it was pausing U.S. District Judge James Bredar's ruling until it decides the government\u2019s full appeal.",
      "Bredar had ordered the employees to be reinstated after finding \"the government conducted massive layoffs, but it gave no advanced notice. It claims it wasn\u2019t required to because, it says, it dismissed each one of these thousands of probationary employees for \u2018performance\u2019 or other individualized reasons. On the record before the Court, this isn\u2019t true.\u201d",
      "Supreme Court temporarily allows two more firings",
      "This week, the Supreme Court also temporarily blocked two other federal employees from being rehired \u2014 whether that decision stands could have widespread implications.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday issued an administrative stay \u2014 essentially a temporary pause \u2014 of orders reinstating Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board.",
      "Trump fired Wilcox and Harris, both Biden appointees serving multiyear terms, during the first weeks of his second term. Both officials challenged their removals by pointing to laws that essentially say they can only be fired for malfeasance or neglect of duty.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in court papers that Trump has the power to fire them regardless.",
      "Both Wilcox and Harris are involved in independent agencies that hear disputes over fired workers. Legal experts have said that if their firings are upheld, it could pave the way for Trump to seek to fire members of the Federal Reserve, which traditionally operates independently of the White House.",
      "The court will decide what next steps to take in the case after hearing from lawyers for the two ousted officials, Roberts order said."

      "Here\u2019s why Diddy was such a big deal",
      "By Daniel Arkin",
      "The world of hip-hop is filled with self-styled moguls and tastemakers. But there was a time when one man lorded over all the rest \u2014 Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs.",
      "In the 1990s and 2000s, few personalities swaggered through the music industry quite like Diddy. In his decades in the public eye, Diddy established himself as a multihyphenate cultural force, building an empire that has now come crashing down amid allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct.",
      "Diddy founded the era-defining Bad Boy Records in 1993 and cultivated the talents of Mary J. Blige, Usher and the Notorious B.I.G. He was their producer and one-man hype machine. In the recording studio, Diddy seamlessly blended rap lyrics with catchy R&B samples, creating a new stylistic template for a generation of artists.",
      "He then pivoted to performing in his own right, pumping out popular tracks such as \u201cI\u2019ll Be Missing You,\u201d \u201cBump, Bump, Bump\u201d and \u201cShake Ya Tailfeather.\u201d He topped the Billboard charts, racked up 14 career Grammy nominations, and earned a reputation as a savvy hitmaker. Diddy, driven by keen commercial instincts, helped push hip-hop firmly into the American mainstream.",
      "Diddy was not content with simply conquering entertainment. He cemented himself as a global lifestyle brand, launching ventures almost as often as he changed his stage name.",
      "He spearheaded the successful clothing label Sean John in 1998. He became \u201cbrand ambassador\u201d for the liquor company C\u00eeroc. He presided over annual \u201cWhite Parties\u201d in the Hamptons. He elevated trendy streetwear into symbols of aspirational luxury.",
      "\u201cHe was an absolute curator of Black taste,\u201d said Gerrick Kennedy, a freelance cultural critic who has covered Diddy for years. \u201cHe had his finger on the pulse.\u201d",
      "Diddy was no stranger to allegations of violence, too. In the decades before he became the focal point of a sweeping federal investigation, he faced legal action or settlement payments more than four dozen times, according to court documents reviewed by NBC News.",

    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 A Southern California judge on Friday cleared the way for a legal process to determine if Erik and Lyle Menendez should be resentenced for the 1989 shotgun murders of their parents.",
      "Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic denied a motion from the district attorney\u2019s office that sought to withdraw his predecessor\u2019s recommendation to reduce the brothers\u2019 prison sentences from life without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life.",
      "A hearing on the matter is scheduled for April 17 and 18.",
      "If Jesic approves the recommendation, the brothers \u2014 who have served 35 years for the murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez at their Beverly Hills home on Aug. 20, 1989 \u2014 could be eligible for parole immediately.",
      "Friday's ruling came after a lengthy and at times heated hearing that saw a deputy district attorney and a defense lawyer arguing over the resentencing effort and a sometimes-exasperated judge who, at one point, said he would \u201ccry a little\u201d if the hearing did not finish Friday.",
      "\"You both have strong arguments,\u201d Jesic said, before noting that he believes those arguments are best saved for next week's hearing.",
      "Wearing blue prison uniforms, the siblings appeared at Friday\u2019s hearing via video link from the San Diego prison where they are incarcerated.",
      "During the hearing, a prosecutor with the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office recounted the \u201cseverity\u201d of the killings \u2014 at one point he showed crime scene photos \u2014 and echoed comments previously made by top prosecutor Nathan Hochman, who said last month that he was withdrawing his predecessor\u2019s recommendation to reduce the brothers\u2019 prison sentences.",
      "Hochman has said that Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are now 54 and 57, respectively, should not be resentenced because they have not exhibited full insight into the murders or taken complete responsibility for their crimes.",
      "The DA stood by his decision after the judge\u2019s ruling Friday evening. \u201cThese murders were calculated, premeditated, cold-blooded killings. Our position remains clear: Until the Menendez brothers finally come clean with all their lies of self-defense and suborning and attempting to suborn perjury, they are not rehabilitated and pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,\u201d Hochman said in a statement.",
      "In a court filing, prosecutors cited more than a dozen alleged lies they said the brothers have not acknowledged about the killings, including that they were defending themselves against an abusive father when they fatally shot their parents.",
      "In a separate filing, defense attorneys countered that Hochman\u2019s statements were \u201cpatently meritless\u201d and said that the previous DA,\u00a0George Gasc\u00f3n, considered and rejected them.",
      "During Friday's hearing, deputy district attorney Habib Balian said that three decades after the murder, the brothers are \"still telling the same lies they were back then.\" He also suggested Gasc\u00f3n's\u00a0decision last year to recommend the reduced sentence was intended to help boost his faltering reelection campaign.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n, who was voted out in November, has denied this and said he made the decision because the brothers have been \u201cexceptional\u201d prisoners and \u201cposter cases\u201d for the DA's resentencing unit.",
      "Jesic and defense attorney Mark Geragos appeared frustrated at times with the length of Balian's presentation, though the judge said he would allow both sides to continue and \"flesh it out.\"",
      "Geragos criticized the prosecution for failing to mention anything the brothers had done while incarcerated \u2014 they've helped inmates with severe disabilities, attended college and established a green space \"beautification\" project \u2014 and called them \"remarkable human beings.\"",
      "\"They didn\u2019t do anything but put their nose down and do the hard work,\" he said.",
      "Geragos said it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that prosecutors had shown the crime scene images with Menendez family members in the courtroom and said \"victims are being re-traumatized all for political purposes.\"",
      "In his ruling Friday, Jesic said that the resentencing decisions made by Hochman and Gasc\u00f3n did not appear political.",
      "The siblings were convicted of first-degree murder after two trials in the 1990s. They said they fatally shot their parents after Lyle confronted their father about alleged ongoing abuse of Erik and threatened to expose the entertainment company executive. Lyle has said his father responded with what he viewed as a threat.",
      "Prosecutors have previously disputed the brothers\u2019 abuse claims, calling them false and saying the killings were cold-blooded and financially motivated.",
      "The Menendez brothers have also sought their freedom through two other legal pathways \u2014 a request for clemency from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and a petition challenging their convictions.",
      "In February, Newsom directed the state\u2019s parole board to conduct a \u201crisk assessment\u201d looking at whether the brothers would pose an unreasonable public safety risk if released. That review is expected to finish in June.",
      "The petition, filed in May 2023, includes what the brothers\u2019 lawyers have described as a critical piece of evidence confirming that Jose Menendez was sexually molesting Erik in the months before he was killed.",
      "Hochman has said that evidence \u2014 an undated photocopy of a letter that Erik has said he sent to a cousin in December 1988 \u2014 does not meet the standard required for a judge to order a new trial."

      "R\u00f3ger de la Rosa, who flew from the United States after finding out on Wednesday that his sister, Rosie de la Rosa Ortega, was one of the fatal victims, was desperately demanding answers from forensic officials on Friday morning. He questioned the need for the autopsies.",

      "\"We don't want an autopsy because we know what they died of. We just want them to give them to us, so we can hold a wake,\" Mej\u00eda told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "Public Health Minister Victor Atallah updated the death toll from 221 to 225 when speaking to Noticias Telemundo early Friday afternoon.",
      "Government officials have said the autopsies help determine if the person died instantly, as a result of their injuries or by asphyxia due to the debris. Also, they said, the autopsies will likely serve as \"important evidence\" in the ongoing investigation into what caused the collapse.",
      "As of late Thursday night, forensic officials had completed 130 autopsies, according to the national attorney general\u2019s office.",
      "Antoliano Peralta, a legal consultant to the Dominican Republic\u2019s executive branch, admitted in an interview with Noticias Telemundo that the tragedy's death toll was so big it \"exceeds the forensic institute's capacity.\"",

      "The attorney general\u2019s office said in a statement the government has \"strengthened our forensic medical team with the goal of completing all autopsies\" by Friday.",
      "Of the autopsies conducted as of Friday morning, over 80% of the victims died of head trauma caused by the impact of the crumbling ceiling, Atallah said. \"That means that they either died instantly or very quickly.\"",
      "\u2018I was trapped in the rubble\u2019",
      "In addition to the hundreds of bodies, rescue crews recovered 189 survivors from the rubble. Cristobal Moya was among those who survived.",
      "Speaking to NBC News from his hospital bed Thursday afternoon, Moya said he survived \"thanks to God.\"",
      "He recalled sitting down to watch renowned merengue singer Rubby P\u00e9rez perform on stage when what appeared to be heavy dust began to fall from above.",
      "\"In a minute, the roof caved in. Something hit my head. I lost consciousness,\" Moya said in Spanish. \"When I woke up, I was trapped in the rubble.\" He thought for a second, \"Was I dreaming? No, I wasn\u2019t.\"",
      "Video from the people who rescued Moya shows him laying face down, his head covered in blood and his body buried in the debris. Moya sustained injuries in his head, torso and legs.",
      "\"God gave me an opportunity,\" Moya said. \"A new opportunity at life.\"",
      "Videos from inside the Jet Set nightclub minutes before disaster struck show what is now P\u00e9rez's last concert. Before the roof collapse killed him, P\u00e9rez was entertaining the crowd with his powerful voice and energetic dance moves.",
      "The videos were filmed by Isaac Gonz\u00e1lez, the nightclub\u2019s official photographer. He was there to capture what was supposed to be a celebratory event starring one of the biggest music stars of the Dominican Republic. But instead, he ended the night documenting one of the country\u2019s deadliest events.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said the roof collapsed when he stepped outside the venue for five minutes to take a break. He was one of the first to film the club's devastation and the emergency response. His videos also show first responders arriving at the scene, later placing body bag after body bag into ambulances.",
      "Funeral services and burials\u00a0for all the victims continue to take place this week.",

      "The portrait appears to be based on a photo of then-candidate Trump, bloodied and surrounded by Secret Service agents, still onstage after being shot at the campaign event. That image, along with Trump\u2019s words to \u201cfight, fight, fight,\u201d became a hallmark of Trump\u2019s bid for a second term.",

      "The new Trump painting takes a spot traditionally reserved for the most recent official presidential portrait. Former President Joe Biden, who left office in January, does not yet have an official portrait.",
      "Tradition dictates that the portraits hanging in this spot \u2014 next to the East Room in the foyer after walking into the White House \u2014 are of the most recent presidents, but that is not a hard and fast rule, a former White House official told NBC News. The president can direct the curator to move things around.",
      "The former official noted that during his first term, Trump moved the portraits of former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.",
      "Trump does not have an official portrait from his first term, which typically would have been unveiled at some point during his successor\u2019s term. At the time, the Biden administration referred questions about the matter to the White House Historical Association, which has facilitated the acquisition of portraits of presidents and first ladies since 1965.",
      "Obama\u2019s portrait was not the only one moved during the recent Trump redecoration. The 44th president's portrait was moved to the spot George W. Bush\u2019s occupied, and Bush's portrait is now in the staircase, according to a White House official.",
      "White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields posted a photo of the Obama portrait\u2019s new location on Friday.",

Trump demanded last month that a painting of him hanging in the Colorado State House be taken down \u2014 it was quickly removed \u2014 and in January, a portrait of former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Mark Milley abruptly disappeared from a dedicated wall in the Pentagon."

      "Mahdi admitted he killed Orangeburg Public Safety officer James Myers in 2004, shooting him at least eight times before burning his body. Myers\u2019 wife found him in the couple\u2019s Calhoun County shed, which had been the backdrop to their wedding 15 months earlier.",
      "Myers\u2019 shed was a short distance through the woods from a gas station where Mahdi tried but failed to buy gas with a stolen credit card and left behind a vehicle he had carjacked in Columbia. Mahdi was arrested in Florida while driving Myers\u2019 unmarked police pickup truck.",
      "Mahdi also admitted to the killing three days earlier of Christopher Boggs, a Winston-Salem, North Carolina, convenience store clerk who was shot twice in the head as he checked Mahdi\u2019s ID. Mahdi was sentenced to life in prison for that killing.",
      "Final appeal",
      "Mahdi\u2019s final appeal was rejected this week by both the U.S. and South Carolina Supreme Courts. His lawyers said Mahdi\u2019s original attorneys put on a shallow case trying to spare his life that didn\u2019t call on relatives, teachers or others who knew him and ignored the impact of months spent in solitary confinement in prison as a teen.",
      "The defense\u2019s case to spare Mahdi\u2019s life before a judge lasted only about 30 minutes. It \u201cdidn\u2019t even span the length of a Law & Order episode, and was just as superficial,\u201d Mahdi\u2019s lawyers wrote.",
      "Mahdi\u2019s earliest memory was his father slamming his mother through a glass table and later lying to his son and saying his mother was dead. Mahdi\u2019s father pulled him out of school in fifth grade when officials suggested he needed behavioral help, defense lawyers said.",
      "Prosecutors said Mahdi constantly used brutality to solve his problems. As a death row prisoner, he stabbed a guard and hit another worker with a concrete block. Mahdi was caught three times with tools he could have used to escape, including a piece of sharpened metal that could be used as a knife, according to prison records.",
      "\u201cThe nature of the man is violence,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Mahdi\u2019s attorney, assistant federal public defender David Weiss, said in a statement that his client died in full view of a system \u201cthat failed him at every turn \u2014 from childhood to his final breath.\u201d",
      "Weiss described the execution as a \u201chorrifying act that belongs in the darkest chapters of history, not in a civilized society.\u201d",
      "Busy death chamber",
      "Mahdi\u2019s death is the end of a busy time in South Carolina\u2019s death chamber. He is the fifth inmate killed since September after the state had not had any executions since 2011. No other inmates are out of appeals but several are close.",
      "The state was able to restart executions after lawmakers allowed the firing squad and passed a bill allowing suppliers of the pentobarbital to remain secret, along with the exact procedures used to kill inmates and the names of prison employees on execution teams, including the firing squad shooters.",
      "Along with Sigmon\u2019s firing squad death last month, three other South Carolina prisoners have been executed via lethal injection since September.",
      "South Carolina now has 28 inmates on its death row. Just one man has been sentenced to death in the past decade."

    "story": [
      "The pilot of the tourist helicopter that crashed into the Hudson River on Thursday afternoon could not have done anything to save himself or his five passengers after the aircraft\u2019s rotor blades and its tail boom detached in the air, an aviation expert said Friday.",
      "\u201cEverything we train for as helicopter pilots is under the assumption that the rotor system is still attached to the aircraft,\u201d said\u00a0Brandt Anderson, a former U.S. Army combat helicopter pilot who is now a policy adviser.\u00a0\u201cOnce that\u2019s separated, there\u2019s no wings, there\u2019s no ability to glide \u2014 it\u2019s just falling out of the sky at that point.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely horrible,\u201d he added.",
      "An official from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said at a news conference Friday that she would not speculate as to a preliminary cause when asked whether the agency had identified one, emphasizing instead that investigators were still searching for components of and structures\u00a0from the aircraft, interviewing witnesses and obtaining records, including of the operator of the helicopter, New York Helicopters, and its owner.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t rule anything out,\u201d said Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the NTSB. \u201cWe take a very detailed and comprehensive view and it\u2019s way too early in the investigation.\u201d",
      "The Bell 206 sightseeing helicopter departed\u00a0a downtown Manhattan heliport at 2:59 p.m. and the ride lasted less than 20 minutes.\u00a0Eyewitness video showed the rotors and the fuselage separating in midair before the helicopter plummeted from the sky, crashing upside-down into the Hudson River near Jersey City, New Jersey.",
      "The crash\u00a0killed\u00a0Agust\u00edn Escobar,\u00a0the chief executive for rail infrastructure for the German technology company Siemens,\u00a0his wife, Merce Camprubi Montal, and their three children, as well as the\u00a0pilot, Sean Johnson.",
      "Divers were still searching for the helicopter\u2019s main rotor, main transmission and its roof and tail structures on Friday, Homendy said.",
      "Robert Joslin, a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona, Florida,\u00a0said that when investigators\u00a0examine the wreckage, they will look at whether there were any structural or impact failures that made the tail rotor come off.",
      "\u201cOnce the tail rotor comes off, I mean, this isn\u2019t speculation, it\u2019s just like a seesaw,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce that tail boom was separated from the rest of the helicopter, then you could see it tumbling.\u201d",
      "Joslin\u00a0previously served as the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s  chief scientific and technical advisor for flight deck technology and was a flight test pilot with the agency. He was also a colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps and a military test pilot.",
      "He said investigators will also probe the aircraft\u2019s maintenance records to see whether there were any issues in its history.",
      "Anderson, the former U.S. Army combat helicopter pilot, and John Cox, a pilot and the president and CEO of Safety Operating Systems LLC, said a fatal crash like this one is very rare.",
      "\u201cThere are instances where the Bell 206, in particular,\u00a0can\u00a0be put into stress by flying it aggressively,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cBut based on what we know now, I don\u2019t think that is the case here \u2014 and that makes it even more concerning. It makes the structural failure even more alarming.\u201d",
      "At the news conference Friday, Homendy urged anyone with photos or videos that they believe could aid investigators to send them to the NTSB.",
      "Homendy said the videos circulating on social media have been \u201cvery helpful\u201d to investigators, but that many of them had been filmed from a far distance and would require further review at the agency\u2019s headquarters.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to get some additional videos that provide us information,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what people have recorded or taken pictures of that could be helpful in an investigation.\u201d",
      "She said the NTSB has found that to be the case in past investigations,\u00a0such as the Ketchikan, Alaska, midair collision in 2019, where photos from a passenger aboard one of the airplanes helped the agency significantly in its investigation.",
      "While it remains unclear how the helicopter broke apart, Joslin said that the primary way that a motor blade would detach is through a \u201cmast bump,\u201d which occurs when excessive flapping of the rotor blades causes the hub to contact the rotor mast.",
      "\u201cIt is one of the hazards that is highlighted in teetering rotor helicopters,\u201d Joslin said."

      "Tariffs were on, then they were off. At least temporarily, and only some of them \u2014 but not for China, which got hit with steeper duties and promptly hit back. Wall Street reeled, then rebounded to its strongest weekly gain in well over a year.",
      "The past week has seen a head-spinning series of U.S. trade policy changes that economists, investors and ordinary consumers increasingly worry will drive up inflation or even trigger a recession.",
      "\u201cThe economy is facing considerable turbulence,\u201d JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said Friday, when the bank reported strong earnings while warning of pitfalls ahead. Both JPMorgan \u2014 which sees 50-50 odds of a recession this year \u2014\u00a0and Morgan Stanley saw revenues jump from stock trading activity as investors raced to adjust their holdings in the face of growing uncertainty.",
      "The major U.S. stock indexes ended on a high Friday after a volatile week of massive losses and gains. The eleventh-hour rebound came after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt signaled that President Donald Trump is \u201coptimistic\u201d for a trade deal with China.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 4.9% on the week, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished up 7.3%. The S&P 500 had its best week since November 2023, ending up 5.7%. That broad-based index was still down 5.5% since April 1, the day before Trump unveiled a sweeping slate of fresh tariffs.",
      "While much of those new import taxes have been reduced for a few months, market watchers and finance executives say major economic headwinds remain.",
      "\u201cTimely resolution which benefits the U.S. would be good for businesses, consumers and the markets,\u201d Wells Fargo told investors Friday about the global trade tensions. In the meantime, \u201cwe expect continued volatility and uncertainty and are prepared for a slower economic environment in 2025,\u201d the bank said.",
      "Larry Fink, CEO of the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, told CNBC on Friday that he thinks the U.S. economy is \u201cvery close, if not in, a recession now.\u201d (An official determination on that front can only be made by a panel of experts at the National Bureau of Economic Research, usually months after the fact.)",
      "Consumer sentiment, meanwhile, plunged 11% since last month, according to a reading Friday by the University of Michigan, the measure\u2019s fourth straight month of declines.",
      "\u201cConsumers report multiple warning signs that raise the risk of recession: expectations for business conditions, personal finances, incomes, inflation, and labor markets all continued to deteriorate this month,\u201d the researchers wrote.",
      "The survey was conducted before Trump changed his mind on the tariffs he\u2019d unveiled just a week earlier, covering nearly 90 countries. He said he came to the decision because more than 75 of them didn\u2019t retaliate and reached out to negotiate.",
      "The temporary policy rollback, however, doesn\u2019t apply to China. After Trump announced he was hiking tariffs on the country to 145%, Beijing retaliated Friday with 125% duties on U.S. goods.",
      "Investors say they aren\u2019t sure exactly how the global trade picture will shake out. Morgan Stanley said in a note Friday that Trump\u2019s 90-day reprieve \u201cmerely extends policy uncertainty\u201d and leaves effective tariff rates at century-long highs.",
      "\u201cWhile any delay of tariffs is beneficial on the margin, it is not the same as their removal,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHistory suggests that elevated and prolonged uncertainty that weighs on business confidence can have detrimental effects on business spending and hiring.\u201d",
      "Inflation eased more than anticipated in March, dipping to an annual rate of 2.4% in government figures published Thursday, and wholesale prices also cooled unexpectedly last month. But analysts were quick to discount the encouraging data.",
      "\u201cThat was nice, but don\u2019t get used to it,\u201d Greg McBride, Bankrate\u2019s chief financial analyst, said in a statement Thursday, citing widespread signs of unease across the consumer economy.",
      "Experts are already warning that common purchases \u2014\u00a0from clothing and auto parts to grocery staples like coffee, nuts and seafood \u2014\u00a0remain on track to get pricier in the months ahead from tariffs. Price hikes are also in store for items extensively produced in China, including toys, video game consoles and electronics.",
      "Barclays analysts said Thursday that retail and import data suggests many consumers \u201chave front-run these tariffs to some extent by making heavy purchases in February and March,\u201d looking to snag Chinese-made gadgets and other items produced abroad before prices rise. Foot traffic at warehouse clubs jumped nearly 10% in the last week of March, days before Trump\u2019s April 2 tariff rollout, according to Placer.ai tracking data, which the company said could indicate a race to stock up.",
      "The Barclays researchers said they expect price pressures to moderate over the course of the year \u201cas firms trade less with China and source from the rest of the world, where we expect the average tariff to remain close to 10%.\u201d But the bank still foresees inflation climbing to 4.1% overall by the end of this year.",
      "\u201cThe economic tariff Armageddon unleashed by Trump last week has been the dark black cloud over stocks since this fiasco began,\u201d Wedbush Securities analysts wrote in a note to clients Friday. The impact has mainly been felt on Wall Street so far, they said, but \u201cthat is all about to change.\u201d"

      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 A Southern California judge on Friday cleared the way for a legal process to determine if Erik and Lyle Menendez should be resentenced for the 1989 shotgun murders of their parents.",
      "Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic denied a motion from the district attorney\u2019s office that sought to withdraw his predecessor\u2019s recommendation to reduce the brothers\u2019 prison sentences from life without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life.",
      "A hearing on the matter is scheduled for April 17 and 18.",
      "If Jesic approves the recommendation, the brothers \u2014 who have served 35 years for the murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez at their Beverly Hills home on Aug. 20, 1989 \u2014 could be eligible for parole immediately.",
      "Friday's ruling came after a lengthy and at times heated hearing that saw a deputy district attorney and a defense lawyer arguing over the resentencing effort and a sometimes-exasperated judge who, at one point, said he would \u201ccry a little\u201d if the hearing did not finish Friday.",
      "\"You both have strong arguments,\u201d Jesic said, before noting that he believes those arguments are best saved for next week's hearing.",
      "Wearing blue prison uniforms, the siblings appeared at Friday\u2019s hearing via video link from the San Diego prison where they are incarcerated.",
      "During the hearing, a prosecutor with the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office recounted the \u201cseverity\u201d of the killings \u2014 at one point he showed crime scene photos \u2014 and echoed comments previously made by top prosecutor Nathan Hochman, who said last month that he was withdrawing his predecessor\u2019s recommendation to reduce the brothers\u2019 prison sentences.",
      "Hochman has said that Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are now 54 and 57, respectively, should not be resentenced because they have not exhibited full insight into the murders or taken complete responsibility for their crimes.",
      "The DA stood by his decision after the judge\u2019s ruling Friday evening. \u201cThese murders were calculated, premeditated, cold-blooded killings. Our position remains clear: Until the Menendez brothers finally come clean with all their lies of self-defense and suborning and attempting to suborn perjury, they are not rehabilitated and pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,\u201d Hochman said in a statement.",
      "In a court filing, prosecutors cited more than a dozen alleged lies they said the brothers have not acknowledged about the killings, including that they were defending themselves against an abusive father when they fatally shot their parents.",
      "In a separate filing, defense attorneys countered that Hochman\u2019s statements were \u201cpatently meritless\u201d and said that the previous DA,\u00a0George Gasc\u00f3n, considered and rejected them.",
      "During Friday's hearing, deputy district attorney Habib Balian said that three decades after the murder, the brothers are \"still telling the same lies they were back then.\" He also suggested Gasc\u00f3n's\u00a0decision last year to recommend the reduced sentence was intended to help boost his faltering reelection campaign.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n, who was voted out in November, has denied this and said he made the decision because the brothers have been \u201cexceptional\u201d prisoners and \u201cposter cases\u201d for the DA's resentencing unit.",
      "Jesic and defense attorney Mark Geragos appeared frustrated at times with the length of Balian's presentation, though the judge said he would allow both sides to continue and \"flesh it out.\"",
      "Geragos criticized the prosecution for failing to mention anything the brothers had done while incarcerated \u2014 they've helped inmates with severe disabilities, attended college and established a green space \"beautification\" project \u2014 and called them \"remarkable human beings.\"",
      "\"They didn\u2019t do anything but put their nose down and do the hard work,\" he said.",
      "Geragos said it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that prosecutors had shown the crime scene images with Menendez family members in the courtroom and said \"victims are being re-traumatized all for political purposes.\"",
      "In his ruling Friday, Jesic said that the resentencing decisions made by Hochman and Gasc\u00f3n did not appear political.",
      "The siblings were convicted of first-degree murder after two trials in the 1990s. They said they fatally shot their parents after Lyle confronted their father about alleged ongoing abuse of Erik and threatened to expose the entertainment company executive. Lyle has said his father responded with what he viewed as a threat.",
      "Prosecutors have previously disputed the brothers\u2019 abuse claims, calling them false and saying the killings were cold-blooded and financially motivated.",
      "The Menendez brothers have also sought their freedom through two other legal pathways \u2014 a request for clemency from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and a petition challenging their convictions.",
      "In February, Newsom directed the state\u2019s parole board to conduct a \u201crisk assessment\u201d looking at whether the brothers would pose an unreasonable public safety risk if released. That review is expected to finish in June.",
      "The petition, filed in May 2023, includes what the brothers\u2019 lawyers have described as a critical piece of evidence confirming that Jose Menendez was sexually molesting Erik in the months before he was killed.",
      "Hochman has said that evidence \u2014 an undated photocopy of a letter that Erik has said he sent to a cousin in December 1988 \u2014 does not meet the standard required for a judge to order a new trial."

      "\u201cThis directly violates state law and the district\u2019s standardized process for written parental consent,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBased on the teacher\u2019s own admission that she knowingly did not comply with state statute she received a letter of reprimand. Teachers, like all employees, are expected to follow the law.\u201d",
      "Since the state will be reviewing Calhoun\u2019s teacher certificate based on the complaint, the district said it will not renew her annual contract, which expires in May, until the issue is resolved.",
      "Dozens of students staged a peaceful walkout Thursday to protest the district\u2019s decision not to renew Calhoun\u2019s contract, according to NBC affiliate WESH of Orlando.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to really show support for Ms. Calhoun and to show that we are not OK with what is going on,\u201d sophomore Brianna Knight told WESH. \u201cWe truly are upset that we are losing such a positive teacher.\u201d",
      "Calhoun\u2019s supporters also started a petition asking the Brevard County School Board to reinstate her. As of Friday afternoon, it had garnered more than 22,000 signatures.",
      "Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the Parental Rights in Education law in March 2022. At that time, it prohibited \u201cclassroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d in kindergarten through third grade \u201cor in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\u201d",
      "A year later, he signed an expanded version of the measure that prohibits sexual orientation or gender identity instruction in prekindergarten through eighth grade, restricts reproductive health education in sixth through 12th grade, and bars schools from requiring students or employees to refer to each other with pronouns that do not align with their assigned sex at birth. It also prohibits transgender school employees from sharing their pronouns with students, among other restrictions.",
      "In July 2023, a few months after DeSantis signed the expanded measure, the Florida Board of Education passed new rules to ensure schools were following the law and to \u201cstrengthen and enhance the safety and welfare of students in K-12 public schools and protect parental rights.\u201d",
      "Among those rules was a requirement that school districts receive parental permission before staffers can call a student by anything other than their legal name, including a nickname, even at the student\u2019s request.",
      "At a school board meeting this week, several parents spoke both in favor of and against the district\u2019s decision not to renew Calhoun\u2019s contract.",
      "\u201cThere was no harm, no threat to safety, no malicious intent,\u201d one parent of a student in the district who also said she was one of Calhoun\u2019s colleagues said during the meeting, WESH reported. \u201cJust a teacher trying to connect with a student, and for that, her contract was not renewed despite her strong dedication and years of service. I ask you, how can we justify this?\u201d",
      "School board member Katye Campbell said during the meeting that people might think the rule is \u201csilly,\u201d but that it\u2019s important.",
      "\u201cThe parents are the number one decision-makers for their children,\u201d Campbell said, The Washington Post reported. In response to a question about students\u2019 rights, she said the district shouldn\u2019t interfere in families\u2019 decisions \u201cunless we legally have a reason to.\u201d"

      "\u201cDrop,\u201d out in theaters April 11, explores a woman faced with that exact conundrum. Starring Meghann Fahy and Brandon Sklenar, the movie follows one woman\u2019s attempt to navigate a nightmare situation.",

The stakes become immediately very high.\u201d",
      "What's the premise of 'Drop'?",
      "Single, widowed mom Violet (Fahy) finally decides to go on a first date, hinting that her last relationship \u2014 which resulted in the birth of her son Toby (Jacob Robinson) \u2014 wasn\u2019t healthy.",
      "With her sister, Jen (Violett Beane), babysitting Toby for the night at Violet\u2019s house, Violet embarks on her date at The Palate, an upscale restaurant on the top floor of a tall building.",
      "Violet gets a text from her date, a photographer named Henry (Brandon Sklenar), informing her he will be late, so she grabs a glass of wine at the bar first. There, she meets friendly bartender Cara (Gabrielle Ryan), flirty pianist Phil (Ed Weeks) and Richard (Reed Diamond) \u2014 a nervous man waiting for his blind date to arrive.",
      "She receives a meme over Digi Drop, the movie\u2019s version of AirDrop, but she declines it as Henry finally arrives, camera bag in tow, claiming if he leaves it in the car someone might break in to try and steal it.",
      "The two are seated and begin their date, with Violet explaining that she needs to keep her phone on the table in case Jen or Toby needs anything from her. Henry is completely fine with this, even giving her a hockey puck he bought as a gift for Toby.",
      "Their date goes smoothly, until Violet starts receiving multiple Digi Drops that get darker and darker in their content. She brings her concerns to Henry, but he says it's probably someone just pranking her. He explains you have to be within 50 feet of someone to send them a Digi Drop so he walks around the restaurant, measuring how far the prankster could be. He concludes that they must be in the dining room with them.",
      "Despite this, the date remains in good spirits until Violet gets a message over Digi Drop from an unknown user called \"Let's Play.\" They tell her to check her security cameras, which she does, seeing that there's a masked man in her home with a gun and a silencer.",
      "She then gets a text from Let's Play telling her to keep her mouth shut and that her phone is cloned so they can see everything she does. They tell her if she calls the cops, Toby dies.",
      "Let's Play tells Violet that if she wants Toby to live, she needs to steal and destroy the SD card from Henry's camera, which she does \u2014 pretending she lost her watch to distract him and flushing the crushed SD card down the toilet. Before she does, however, she sees some of the photos stored on it, which are of politicians and wire transfer statements.",
      "Then, she's given a much harder task: she's instructed to kill Henry if she wants Toby to live. Let's Play secretly stashed a vial of poison in the bathroom for her to use, which they explain will kill Henry \"quickly and painlessly.\"",
      "When Violet says she can\u2019t kill someone, Let\u2019s Play responds that she\u2019s killed someone before \u2014 she can do it again.",
      "Very aware of all the cameras on her and the bugs at her table and in the bathroom, she tries to determine who in the restaurant it could be, but to no avail. During all of this, Henry senses something is wrong and tries to leave the date. After being informed that Toby will die if Henry leaves, she convinces him to stay with a kiss.",
      "Henry stays and, despite the life-or-death situation going on, they are able to bond, with Henry sharing that he's worked for the mayor for five years \u2014 although he doesn't seem happy about it.",
      "When Henry asks her why she's a therapist, Violet explains that she works with abuse survivors as she's a survivor herself and wants to help others now. She says the trauma of abuse rears its head at different times, explaining away some of her weird behavior that evening.",
      "Over the course of the date, Violet struggles with the ethics of killing Henry, trying different tricks to secretly let others know her son is in danger \u2014 including secretly informing Phil, but this only gets him killed too.",
      "In response, Let's Play has the masked man in her home attack Jen, knocking her out with the butt of his gun. The masked man then picks Toby up and locks him in his room.",

      "There, Henry confronts her about the watch that fell out of her purse, asking her why she's lying to him. The two have a heartfelt conversation about being honest and genuine. Violet admits to staying in an abusive relationship even after her son was born. She says she is still stuck in it at times, revealing she once watched Blake almost kill Toby as she just sat there.",
      "\"And that's the kind of mother I am,\" she says, to which Henry confides that in the past, he's found himself in a messed-up situation that hurt good people for a long time and he still feels the guilt.",
      "Henry tells Violet that abusive people will make you feel guilty, even if they are dead. Violet tells Henry he's a good guy, but still pretends she forgot the limes for their shots. When Henry goes to grab them, she poisons his shot.",
      "Henry asks if they can toast to \"hope,\" which they do. The poisoned shot is on his lips, but Violet has a change of heart. She spills her red wine all over him so he won't take the shot.",
      "\"That wasn't smart,\" Let's Play texts Violet as Henry goes to clean up in the bathroom.",
      "Cara approaches Violet, saying she can tell she's been acting weird all night and offering to help get her out of a bad date. Then she gives away the clue that puts the pieces together for Violet.",
      "Cara tells her that Richard has been staring at Violet all night and is seated at a table another regular normally requests.",
      "Violet pieces together that Richard must be Let's Play as he's been watching her all night and Violet knew that whoever Let's Play was called ahead and requested her table and their own.",
      "She goes over to Richard and offers him a shot. He refuses the shot kindly but uses her name while turning it down. She tells him that she never told him her name.",
      "That's when Richard drops all pretenses and darkly tells her to sit. He takes out his earpiece and tells her he admires her tenacity, although he says it won't help her.",
      "He makes her drink one of the shots she brought over (non-poisoned) as he explains that the table he's sitting at is situated in the blind spot of the cameras. He explains that people hired him to get rid of Henry and the SD card as those were the final two loose ends left for covering up the mayor's fraud. He also reveals that Henry is an FBI informant.",
      "Richard's plan will have Violet take the fall for Henry's death as she's on camera poisoning his shot at her table and he made the poison from drugs Violet often prescribes. He says it will be painted as \"widow assassin strikes again,\" despite Violet maintaining she didn't kill her husband.",
      "Pants now clean, Henry approaches Violet and Richard. Richard immediately starts playing nice again, offering Henry the poisoned shot, which he initially refuses but then takes.",
      "Violet asks Henry to give them one more minute and she will explain everything. Henry excuses himself. Richard then calls the masked man to call off the kill mission on Toby and tells Violet that her son will be safe.",
      "He digs into the dessert in front of him, saying all that's left is for him to enjoy his dessert and watch Henry die.",
      "As Richard eats, Violet reveals that this meal reminds her of the last time her abusive husband Blake took her out for dinner. She says he would always take her for an \"apology dinner,\" which taught her how to be good at pretending.",
      "She tells Richard she only pretended to poison the shot and that while he was talking to Henry just a moment ago, she poisoned his dessert.",
      "Furious at being outsmarted, Richard pulls out a gun and shoots at Violet, but Henry pushes her out of the way \u2014 taking the bullet himself. One of Richard's bullets whizzes past and hits the glass wall, where small cracks begin to form.",
      "Violet confronts him, grabbing the closest thing she can reach: the puck Henry bought as a gift for Toby. She chucks the hockey puck at the cracks in the glass window, causing it to burst open where the force of the wind sucks Richard out of it.",
      "But the wind is so strong that Violet is also sucked out of the window.",
      "She grabs hold of a ripping tablecloth, dangling over the side of the building until a bleeding Henry pulls her back up to safety. She instructs Henry to apply pressure to his wound, then takes his keys and drives home quickly since before Richard died, he had instructed his counterpart to kill Jen and Toby.",
      "Back at Violet's house, Jen is mid fight with the intruder, trying her hardest to keep Toby safe. Violet arrives, grabbing a kitchen knife and sneaking up behind him to stab him in the chest.",
      "The masked man throws Violet across the table, kicking her in the side. The masked man gets ready to kill Violet, but Toby uses his remote control toy truck to deliver the gun to Violet, which she quickly grabs and kills the intruder with.",
      "What happens with Henry and Violet?",
      "The end of the movie takes place while Henry and Jen are both recuperating from gunshot wounds in the hospital. A news program in the background informs viewers that the mayor's office has been linked to an embezzlement scheme.",
      "Violet visits Henry with food, where he thanks her for saving his life. The pair agrees to a second date before drinking the milkshakes Violet brought for them."

      "\u201cImagine if these kids had been on a movie set for Lionsgate,\u201d Matthew Sarelson, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, told the Times in 2022. \u201cPeople would go to jail if this had happened at a studio.\u201d",
      "Smith has denied that she was running a professional production studio and said it was parents\u2019 responsibility to manage their kids\u2019 schooling.",
      "The Squad members\u2019 lawsuit was settled in October 2024 for $1.85 million, according to NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis was never about the money \u2014 it was about holding an individual accountable, telling the truth, and taking a step toward healing,\u201d Angela Sharbino, the parent of one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement, according to NBC News. \u201cAll of these kids have now moved on from the \u2018Squad\u2019 and are closing this chapter of their lives.\u201d",

      "After the 2022 lawsuit was filed, YouTube demonetized Piper\u2019s channel, meaning she could no longer earn revenue from her videos. She still posts occasional YouTube videos, such as a 10-minute vlog entitled \u201cWeek in my Life as a Full Time Influencer\u201d in November 2024.",
      "\u201cObviously I film vlogs like this, but I don\u2019t really get a lot out of it besides the satisfaction of knowing you guys enjoy watching them, and I get a lot of fun memories that I can go back and watch, which I think is cool,\u201d she says in the video.",

      "One scene from the 2024 vlog shows Piper decorating a Christmas tree at 11:30 p.m. as part of a paid brand deal.",
      "The narrator, who appears to be Hill, says in the video that after they are done filming the Christmas tree scene, they still have to shoot something for her vlog that is going out \u201cin a couple hours.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have to finish editing it and we don\u2019t have a thumbnail for it,\u201d he says. \u201cSo there are so many stresses, you guys have no idea what this is like.\u201d",

      "\u201cI have no room to complain about my life because things could be a lot worse. But what I do have to say is, it is hard work on my end. I\u2019ve never had, like, a normal job, but whatever I\u2019m doing right now, it feels like a job. It takes a lot out of me. I go to bed at night and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my God, what did I do today?\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cAnd on top of everything, all I want to do most of the time is just go work out because it makes me so happy,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, the one moment in my life when everything is quiet and I don\u2019t have to think about anything or please anybody.\u201d"

    "summary": "The viral TikTok series called Group Chat is taking over the internet. The series' creator Sydney Robinson talks the inspiration for the video, working with Charlie Puth and what's next.",
    "story": [
      "Sydney Robinson is the showrunner, director, writer, cinematographer and star of the internet\u2019s new favorite show: a series of TikToks about a girls\u2019 group chat.",
      "The first video, which Robinson, 27, posted March 30, introduces viewers to a set of roommates whose group text chain starts to blow up when another friend makes a controversial move: inviting her boyfriend to that night's dinner reservation.",
      "What ensues is a series of passive aggressive remarks and verbal spars exchanged between the group chat's members.",
      "Online, viewers can't get enough of the drama.",
      "As of Friday, April 11, the original \u201cGroup Chat\u201d video has more than 30 million views, nearly 4 million likes and over 20,000 comments. Celebrities like Stassi Schroeder and Bethenny Frankel have posted their own videos weighing in on the drama, while Leslie Jones, Hailey Bieber and Charlie Puth (more on that later) have commented that they\u2019re hooked on the plot\u2019s twists and turns.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been gaining around 100,000 (followers) every day, steady,\u201d Robinson tells TODAY.com.",
      "On April 11, Robinson appeared live on TODAY to share more about the videos, joking that she hasn\u2019t slept much since the series went viral.",
      "\u201cI try to do it when I get home from work, or in the morning before I go, which I know sounds crazy,\u201d she told Savannah Guthrie and Willie Geist. (She has a day job with an estate jewelry company.) \u201cSetting up the camera and getting into the different outfits is what takes the most time. ... Sometimes when people are like, \u2018It\u2019s been four days!\u2019 People don\u2019t realize I don\u2019t do this full time.\u201d",
      "The TikToker, who has been posting content on the app since around the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly about popular TV shows, says before posting the first \u201cGroup Chat\u201d video she was \u201cstuck\u201d at around 260,000 followers.",
      "She hit 1 million on Saturday, April 5.",
      "The inspiration",
      "Robinson says she\u2019s been trying to write the \u201cGroup Chat\u201d series for about a year.",
      "It all started when she was watching an episode of \u201cJersey Shore: Family Vacation\u201d while flying to Las Vegas in the summer of 2024, she tells TODAY.com.",
      "In the episode, Mike \u201cThe Situation\u201d Sorrentino\u00a0gets released from jail and alerts the rest of the cast via their group chat.",
      "\u201cHe texts everyone that he\u2019s out, and they\u2019re all on a vacation in a house sleeping, and it just revives the group chat,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cIt revives the entire group. Everyone\u2019s like, waking up, looking at it, and just the very idea of his name popping up on their home screen sent shock waves through the house.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018That. That feeling,\u2019\u201d she adds of what she wants to capture in her TikTok series.",
      "The storyline so far involves one friend nearly hijacking her friends\u2019 dinner by inviting her boyfriend, Justin, named for an inside joke among her friends.",
      "The girl, Hailey (named after the character from \u201cOne Tree Hill\u201d \u2014 not Hailey and Justin Bieber, Robinson notes), insists Justin had \u201csuch a rough day\u201d and she doesn\u2019t \u201cwant to leave him alone.\u201d The rest of the girls in the group chat try to shut it down.",
      "Robinson says the story does draw from some of her own experiences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so funny the ways in which being a woman is such a universal experience,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think having a really close group of girlfriends with very different personalities that are bound to clash, but it doesn\u2019t always mean the end of a friendship.\u201d",
      "After the series started to go viral, she says people started to text her asking, \u201cIs this about this person?\u201d or, \u201cIs this about that story I told you?\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018No,\u2019 but that\u2019s how universal it is, that everybody lowkey thinks I\u2019m like, subtweeting them, and I\u2019m not,\u201d she says.",
      "Tensions escalate in Part 2 as Hailey leaves the group chat, while the rest of the girls find out the original reservation included Justin in the tally all along.",
      "Then in Part 3, Hailey asks to rejoin the group and confirms she'll join them for dinner sans Justin \u2014\u00a0only for the rest of the girls to find him already at the restaurant, sparking confusion from nearly all parties.",
      "Robinson posted Part 4 of the series, which saw the aftermath of the group\u2019s arrival at the restaurant, on April 5. And for the first time, one of the characters wasn\u2019t played by Robinson.",
      "Instead one of the series\u2019 biggest fans lent his voice to the role of the elusive boyfriend \u2014 Puth.",
      "Yes, that character was voiced by Charlie Puth",
      "After posting Part 2 of her series, Robinson says she took a nap. Meanwhile, her mom, who has been on vacation out of the country, started calling.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s calling me like 100 times, and she\u2019s like, \u2018Charlie Puth commented on your video,\u2019\u201d Robinson recalls. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018No, shut up.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so invested in this\u2026,\u201d Puth commented.",
      "After, they ended up messaging, and she outright asked if he\u2019d be the voice actor for the Justin character. She says she was \u201cso surprised\u201d he agreed.",
      "\u201cI have no idea why this massive man in the music industry with 22 million followers would want to be a part of my \u2018Group Chat\u2019 skit,\u201d she says.",
      "The goal was to create a bit of mystery by not revealing the voice actor. But within 10 minutes of the video going live, Robinson says she noticed comments like, \u201cWait, is that Charlie Puth?\u201d She says one TikTok user even made a video comparing clips of Puth talking with the voice of Justin to confirm they\u2019re the same.",
      "Once people caught on, Puth confirmed his involvement by commenting, \u201cWhy does Justin\u2019s voice sound familiar \u2026\u201d",
      "Asked if this guest role will turn into a regular gig, Robinson says the goal was to write Justin into just one episode.",
      "\u201cObviously if he ever wanted to be involved ... of course he\u2019s got the part, no question,\u201d she says.",
      "Plus, there might be more special guests to look out for.",
      "\u201cAt this point, it seems like Charlie Puth might not be the last guest star for \u2018Group Chat.\u2019 There might be some more to come,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cHopefully I can keep writing this forever, and hopefully there\u2019s just a bunch of fun surprises in store.\u201d",
      "What's next?",
      "Right now, fans are left on a cliffhanger, with Part 4 revealing that Justin had separate plans at that restaurant with another woman, who calls him, \u201cbabe,\u201d in the final seconds of the skit, implying Hailey might have been trying to catch Justin cheating on her.",
      "Going forward, Robinson hints that there will be a bit of a \u201credemption arc\u201d for Hailey.",
      "There\u2019s one more video planned for the story of this fateful girls\u2019 night out dinner, Robinson says.",
      "\u201cWe are going to kind of get an answer about what\u2019s been going on,\u201d Robinson promises.",
      "But she emphasizes, \u201cJust because the dinner segment has ended, doesn\u2019t mean the group chat is done.\u201d",
      "In fact, she says she already has storylines planned for situations like, \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d and \u201cThe Birthday.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are keeping the same characters,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to change the scenario. And it might not always be Hailey. Because everyone has their annoying qualities.\u201d",
      "And fans shouldn\u2019t have too long to wait. After \u201cThe Dinner\u201d storyline has wrapped, Robinson says she\u2019ll probably dive right back in.",
      "\u201cTikTok does not allow me the time to take a beat,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cPeople are finding my Venmo and requesting like one cent, but being like, 'What I\u2019m actually requesting is Part 4.'\u201d"

      "Mickey Rourke is under scrutiny after comments he made toward JoJo Siwa in the \"Celebrity Big Brother U.K.\" house were criticized as homophobic and problematic.",
      "On April 10, \"Celebrity Big Brother U.K.\" and ITV, the British network on which it airs, released a clip of the most recent episode in which the incidents occurred. In it, Rourke is heard making comments about Siwa in the backyard, including suggesting he could change the 21-year-old performer's sexuality.",
      "ITV did not immediately respond to TODAY.com's request for comment. A representative for Siwa did not return TODAY.com\u2019s request for comment either, nor did Rourke\u2019s team.",
      "The first of the exchanges began when the 72-year-old actor asked Siwa if she was attracted to boys or girls.",
      "\u201cGirls. My partner is non-binary,\u201d responded Siwa, who \u2014 according to E! News \u2014 is currently dating Kath Ebbs, an Australian influencer",
      "Rourke then replied, \u201cIf I stay longer than four days, you won\u2019t be gay anymore.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s homophobic, if that was your reasoning,\u201d Siwa said as she sat nearby.",

      "Siwa added, \"You also can't say that.\"",
      "Moments later, Rourke shouted, \u201cI need a f\u2014!\u201d before gesturing toward Siwa and adding, \u201cI\u2019m not talking to you.\u201d",
      "Once again, Hughes stepped in, repeating, \u201cMickey, you can\u2019t say that.\u201d",
      "After Rourke left the backyard, Siwa told Hughes, \"It's crazy to me that that still exists.\" She then became visibly upset by the exchange and began to cry. Hughes comforted her. Inside, Rourke was summoned to the diary room.",
      "There, the voice of \"Big Brother\" addressed Rourke's behavior, according to ITV\u2019s summary of the episode.",
      "\u201cMickey, before you entered the Big Brother house, the rules regarding unacceptable language and behavior were explained to you,\u201d a voice told him. His remarks were read back, and he was asked, \u201cDo you understand how this language could be offensive to your housemates or the viewing public?\u201d",

      "Later, Rourke addressed the group and offered an apology directly to Siwa.",
      "\u201cI want to apologize. I\u2019ve got a habit of having a short fuse, and I don\u2019t mean nothing by it,\u201d he said.",
      "During a later conversation involving Rourke, Siwa and castmate Danny Beard, the winner of season four of \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK,\" Rourke asked whether the term \u201cdrag\u201d was still appropriate to use.",
      "Siwa responded saying, \u201cAnything is OK to say in context and intention\u2026 and if you say something wrong but you didn\u2019t know and you\u2019re open to hearing, it\u2019s all good.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe said some pretty hurtful things,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think one thing you really have to do in the Big Brother house is care about others. Him saying that flat out today, honestly, made the killer nomination choice pretty easy.\u201d",
      "Siwa continued, \u201cI feel like a lot of the public isn\u2019t going to be too happy with Mickey after seeing how this day went. So I do think it\u2019s possible that he could be evicted from the house.\u201d"

    "summary": "\"Good American Family\" star Imogen Faith Reid and the creator Katie Robbins detail the turning point in Natalia Grace's life in the show's fifth and sixth episodes.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cGood American Family\u201d viewers saw a shift in perspective in the Hulu drama\u2019s fifth episode.",
      "Titled \u201cToo Hurty Without It,\u201d Episode 5 puts the spotlight on Natalia Grace \u2014 portrayed by 27-year-old British actor Imogen Faith Reed \u2014 after her adoptive parents, Michael and Kristine Barnett, move and leave her on her own in a small apartment.",
      "The episode, creator and co-showrunner Katie Robbins tells TODAY.com, was meant to make viewers question \u201ceverything they\u2019ve seen before and their assumptions that they\u2019ve made\u201d surrounding Natalia and her circumstances.",
      "\u201cGood American Family\u201d is a fictionalization of Grace\u2019s true story. Born in Ukraine with a rare form of dwarfism, Grace was adopted by a New Hampshire couple in 2008, before they put her up for re-adoption in 2010, according to a 2021 document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Grace was then adopted by Michael and Christine Barnett, who began to suspect that she was not a little girl, but a grown adult who was trying to kill them. According to the Court of Appeals document, Grace's Ukrainian adoption paperwork stated she was born in 2003.",
      "The couple had Grace medically and psychologically tested, before they successfully had a court order to change her birth year from 2003 to 1989, \u201cbased on age estimates provided by a primary care physician and social worker,\u201d per the document from the Indiana Court of Appeals.",
      "Grace has maintained that she was a child at the time of her adoption, and that Kristine Barnett told her to say she was older. \u201cI was terrified of her. I was terrified, so when Kristine told me to tell people that I was 22, I listened because I didn\u2019t know what she would have me do. I didn\u2019t know what she would do to me,\u201d Grace says in the documentary \"The Curious Case of Natalia Grace.\"",
      "\u201cShe threatened me into telling people lies. At first I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m a kid,\u2019 and I guess she just got so mad,\" she continued.",
      "According to a 2019 affidavit filed in the Tippecanoe Court in Indiana obtained by\u00a0TODAY.com, a doctor at Peyton Manning Children\u2019s Hospital examined Grace and determined her age was about 8. A skeletal examination of Grace found she was 11 years old in 2012, per the affidavit.",
      "The document from the Indiana Court of Appeals also states that in 2013, the Barnetts did in fact move Grace into two apartments in Indiana and helped her get federal disability benefits and supportive services to help her \u201cas an adult.\u201d The couple then relocated to Canada with their three biological children.",
      "This is where Episode 5 starts. Prior to that, \u201cGood American Family\u201d was told from Kristine Barnett (Ellen Pompeo) and Michael Barnett\u2019s (Mark Duplass) perspective, depicting Natalia as a sinister adult pretending to be a child.",
      "The latest episode details Natalia living on her own without her walker. She struggles with everyday tasks like turning on the shower and getting into the bathtub, which makes her unable to bathe herself. Because of her small stature, she isn't able to reach the top cabinets in the kitchen and finds it difficult to make herself a meal. She is seen spending her days in front of the television, eating junk food as the apartment becomes a mess.",
      "All alone, at one point, she accidentally cuts her hand trying to open a can of food.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Natalia says, as her hand is covered in blood. \u201cMommy, please mommy. I don\u2019t know how to take care of this.\u201d",
      "She seeks help from a neighbor, who confuses her for a child, but Natalia tells her she's an adult who looks young.",
      "\u201cI remember reading the script and thinking, \u2018OK, this is going to be a big episode for me,\u201d Reid tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt was a little daunting because it\u2019s just me and long hours on set.\u201d",
      "The episode, Robbins tells TODAY.com, is the first time Natalia is seen on screen by herself.",
      "\u201cOne might not realize it watching the first four episodes, but in those first four episodes, you\u2019re never in a scene only with\u00a0Natalia. She can only be in a scene if she\u2019s in a scene with Kristine or Michael, because those episodes are from their perspective,\u201d Robbins says. \u201cSo by the time you get to (Episode) 5 and you\u2019re on the other side of that door, it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve been in a room alone with her.\u201d",
      "As the episode continues, viewers see Natalia getting into trouble after she and the neighbor\u2019s grandson take the bus and get lost while attempting to go to the Barnetts\u2019 home.",
      "She is treated poorly by adoptive parents, who after the incident have to move her to a new apartment, which happens to be on the second floor and even smaller. The hardships continue for Natalia, who feels abandoned, yet attempts to \u201cstraighten up\u201d to earn her family\u2019s love.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden you have to say, \u2018Oh my gosh, all these things that have come to believe about her, were they true, or were they not true?'\u201d",
      "Katie Robbins",
      "'\u201cAll of a sudden you have to say, \u2018Oh my gosh, all these things that have come to believe about her, were they true, or were they not true?'\u201d Robbins says. \u201cAnd that episode was incredibly emotional to write, and it was incredibly emotional to film.\u201d",
      "Robbins says that watching Reid film her solo scenes was incredibly emotional for everyone on set.",
      "\u201cWatching (Imogen) play those scenes, people on our crew, people who have been doing this job for decades and who have seen it all, seasoned pros, were crying watching her because of the vulnerability that she brings and because of the themes that it deals with,\u201d Robbins adds.",
      "Reid tells TODAY.com that the fifth episode does \u201csuch an amazing job\u201d of showing her character\u2019s point of view.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s just been abandoned, and she's not only 8 years old, but she has a disability, and it\u2019s just so heartbreaking to see her go through all of that,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd for her, to just get worse and worse as we go on, because (she) can\u2019t look after herself, Episode 5 is something that I\u2019m genuinely so proud of.\u201d",
      "Viewers will continue to see life from Natalia\u2019s perspective when Episode 6 of \u201cGood American Family\u201d premieres Wednesday, April 16."

    "story": [
      "If you\u2019re upset that there\u2019s no royal jam in Montecito, you had better compote yourself.",
      "On April 2, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, released the first eight products from her lifestyle brand As Ever. From Herbal Hibiscus Tea to Flower Sprinkles (which showed up on her Netflix show, \u201cWith Love, Meghan\u201d), everything flew off the virtual shelves within an hour.",
      "Given Meghan\u2019s air of luxuriousness, folks have been wondering how the brand would do as fears of a recession loom large, but in an April 8 interview with Fortune, Meghan said she wasn\u2019t worried.",
      "\u201cAt the moment, all of our products are currently made in the U.S., so we don\u2019t anticipate tariffs affecting us directly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as we look at the larger context of how this is going to affect the consumer day to day, I\u2019m very grateful that in part of the conception of this brand, I wanted to create products that look more prestige, but are more accessible and affordable. I think during any time of recession, people still want to find creature comforts, items that can bring them joy.\u201d",
      "I was one of the lucky souls to be able to secure a jar of her Raspberry Spread\u00a0 \u2014 which retails for $9, or $15 with a keepsake box \u2014 which the brand says is \u201cwhere it all began.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also the spread that everyone seems to be talking about online, from Instagram to TikTok, so I was eager to try it.",
      "First thing\u2019s first: This isn\u2019t jam.",
      "Months ago, every celebrity from\u00a0Chrissy Teigen\u00a0to \u201cReal Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d star Garcelle Beauvais gabbed about the royal\u2019s \u201cjam,\u201d but Meghan actually\u00a0sent 50 jars of strawberry\u00a0spread\u00a0labeled with brand\u2019s old name \u2014\u00a0American Riviera Orchard\u00a0\u2014 and nothing about its contents. We\u2019ve been jam-boozled by the glitterati.",
      "With all that in mind, I was assuming a thick texture when I opened the jar and almost spilled it all over myself. The confusion is widespread \u2014 and valid! \u2014 as fruit cooked with sugar goes by a bevy of names: jam, jelly, chutney, marmalade and more.",
      "This raspberry spread has pectin in it, like jam typically does, but it isn\u2019t like the jam you find on store shelves.",
      "To compare, Bonne Maman\u2019s Raspberry Preserves \u2014\u00a0also not jam \u2014 has similar ingredients, including pectin, but is much thicker. I would call this a syrup, compote or coulis. Meghan is calling it \u201cspread,\u201d though \u2014 so spread it is!",
      "Tastewise, I found it fresh and bright. The raspberry sweetness gives way to a lemony tartness I found really refreshing paired with whipped cream cheese on an English muffin. The consistency, though surprising at first, gives it a homemade feel, as does the ratio of raspberry to lemon. It tasted like a sunny day, even though it\u2019s overcast as I stare out my window.",
      "I don\u2019t think the spread would work on a closed sandwich, though: It would likely sploosh out of a peanut butter and jelly \u2014 er, spread \u2014 leaving your hands a sticky mess. On the other hand, I suspect this spread would go fabulously in a crepe \u2014 which is probably a reason the brand sells mix for that, too \u2014 or poured over pancakes.",
      "I was pleasantly surprised by how different this product and the others I\u2019ve tried are from that of competitors in the market. Last night, I tried the Herbal Peppermint Tea and it was so minty, I felt like I was drinking a pack of liquid Altoids \u2014 an unexpected feeling, but not a bad one.",
      "I\u2019m excited to try more products from Meghan\u2019s brand as it expands \u2014 but only if I can get my hands on them fast enough."

      "Noah Wyle says he's \"profoundly sad and disappointed\" about a legal action alleging the Max hit \"The Pitt\" is an unsanctioned revival of \"ER,\" 16 years after the legendary NBC drama ended its run.",
      "Wyle, a cast member of both shows and an executive producer on \"The Pitt,\" spoke to Variety about his reaction to the lawsuit filed by the estate of late author and executive producer Michael Crichton, who wrote the screenplay for what became the pilot episode of \"ER.\"",
      "\u201cThe only thing that I can legally speak to is how I feel emotionally, which is just profoundly sad and disappointed,\" Wyle said. \"This taints the legacy, and it shouldn\u2019t have. At one point, this could have been a partnership. And when it wasn\u2019t a partnership, it didn\u2019t need to turn acrimonious. But on the 30th anniversary of \u2018ER,\u2019 I\u2019ve never felt less celebratory of that achievement than I do this year.\u201d",
      "Crichton's estate, which includes his widow, Sherri Crichton, filed a lawsuit in August 2024 accusing the creators of \"The Pitt\" of breach of contract and two other counts. Wyle, former \"ER\" producer R. Scott Gemmill and executive producer John Wells were among the named defendants. Gemmill created \"The Pitt,\" and Wells is an executive producer on the show along with Wyle.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Sherri Crichton's attorney for comment and has not yet heard back.",
      "Wyle, 53, played Dr. John Carter, a young hotshot doctor, on \u201cER,\u201d and portrays Dr. Michael \u201cRobby\u201d Robinavitch, a grizzled veteran of the emergency room at a Pittsburgh hospital, in \u201cThe Pitt.\"",
      "\u201cNoah Wyle\u2019s character is Dr. John Carter from \u2018ER\u2019 in all but name, only 30 years later, and imbued with the experience and lessons learned during the 15-year run of the original series,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.",
      "The defendants started work on an \"ER\" reboot in 2020 with plans for it to air on HBO Max, according to the complaint. The lawsuit alleges the defendants did this \"without any notice\" to Sherri Crichton and with \"brazen disregard\" of contractual rights of Michael Crichton's estate, according to the complaint.",
      "The creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d argued that making the show was a \u201cconstitutionally protected act of free speech,\u201d according to a\u00a0ruling by the Superior Court of California in February.",
      "Wyle told Variety that he and \u201cThe Pitt\u201d creators purposefully set out to do a different show after the negotiations with Crichton's estate over an \u201cER\u201d revival fell apart.",
      "\u201cWe pivoted as far in the opposite direction as we could in order to tell the story we wanted to tell \u2014\u202fand not for litigious reasons, but because we didn\u2019t want to retread our own creative work,\u201d Wyle said.",
      "\u201cWe really wanted to find something new for ourselves,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd in some ways, that\u2019s what was so disheartening about the whole thing. We really felt like we\u2019d done it.\u201d",
      "Wyle told Variety that an \"ER\" reboot \"got pretty close to being a reality,\" but Warner Bros. Television could not come to an agreement with Sherri Crichton, who oversees her late husband's estate.",

      "Journalists are protected under international humanitarian law \u201cas long as they do not take a direct part in the hostilities,\u201d according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said that Aslih had \u201cparticipated\u201d in the Oct. 7 attacks and that he had documented and uploaded video of \u201clooting, arson and murder to social media.\u201d",
      "Israel has often asserted that journalists it has killed were either members of Hamas or supporters, frequently without providing clear evidence.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said it had taken \u201cnumerous steps\u201d to mitigate harm to civilians before it launched the strike Sunday, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence.",
      "Asked by NBC News on Tuesday whether it was aware that other journalists were at the tent camp when the strike was launched, the IDF shared its initial statement, which did not directly address the question."

    "summary": "Former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove says that if President Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize he should hold off negotiating a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 If President Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, he should hold off negotiating a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, Britain\u2019s former top spy told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Richard Dearlove, the ex-head of British intelligence agency MI6, said that rushing a truce \u2014 and giving too many concessions to the Kremlin \u2014 could encourage President Vladimir Putin to launch other hostile forays into Europe.",
      "The Russians badly need a ceasefire, said Dearlove, citing waning Kremlin cash reserves and the falling price of crude oil, which Moscow exports to fund its war machine.",
      "\u201cUkraine is pretty close to a tipping point,\u201d he said in a wide-ranging interview. \u201cBut the worry at the moment is that Trump will do a premature deal with the Russians\u201d and make too many concessions.",
      "The \u201chighly undesirable\u201d consequences would be to \u201cembolden the Russians, over time, to be more aggressive and assertive in Europe,\u201d said Dearlove over a coffee at one of London\u2019s historic private members clubs.",
      "His remarks come as Ukraine\u2019s military chief said Russia had launched a new offensive in the Eastern European country.",
      "While often less critical of Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach than many other foreign policy experts, Dearlove said he finds Trump\u2019s general \u201clack of grace\u201d and \u201clack of decent behavior\u201d to be \u201cvery disconcerting\u201d \u2014 specifically his Oval Office bust-up with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February.",
      "\u201cMy general view of Americans is they\u2019re gracious and they behave very respectfully,\u201d said a gently amused Dearlove, 80, an Olympic rower\u2019s son who spent a year at Connecticut\u2019s preparatory Kent School before gaining his degree back in Britain at the University of Cambridge. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary the way that Trump has blown up all of that.\u201d",
      "The jovial, outspoken grandee of the British foreign policy establishment joined MI6 in 1966 and served as its chief \u2014 code-named \u201cC\u201d \u2014 between 1999 and 2004. He now co-hosts the \u201cOne Decision\u201d podcast, covering global news, alongside former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.",
      "He says he \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the American president\u2019s campaign to pressure European allies to spend more on defense, decrying the imbalance of Europe enjoying a relatively generous health care and benefits system while letting the U.S. foot the bill for Western defense.",
      "\u201cWhy should American taxpayers pay for indulgent social security programs in countries like Germany, France and Italy?\u201d he said.",
      "He dismisses \u201cSignalgate\u201d \u2014 in which Trump\u2019s team discussed bombing Yemen on the messaging app Signal \u2014 as a \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201csilly mistake\u201d that showed \u201ca degree of amateurism.\u201d And he said it wouldn\u2019t have a long-term impact on Western intelligence sharing.",
      "Reached for comment on Dearlove\u2019s remarks, White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said, \u201cPresident Trump is a master negotiator who has done more to bring about world peace during his tenure than any president in modern history.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe President\u2019s Peace Through Strength agenda has delivered historic achievements across the globe and restored American dominance on the world stage,\u201d Fields added. \u201cThe \u2018experts\u2019 have been wrong for decades, and doing the same thing while expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.\u201d",
      "The ex-MI6 head says his biggest short-term worry revolves around Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine, which has involved parallel talks with both Kyiv and Moscow and has been lambasted by Trump\u2019s critics in the West as being too favorable to the latter.",
      "\u201cIf you want to get the Nobel Peace Prize, don\u2019t do a premature deal with Ukraine \u2014 wait,\u201d Dearlove said. (According to former aides, the president still covets the landmark award won by four of his predecessors, and for which Trump has been nominated at least twice before.)",
      "Dearlove believes the Russians are on the back foot and will only come under more pressure to accept terms. \u201cThe Russians themselves badly need a ceasefire, but Putin is incapable of seeking one because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a reverse gear,\u201d Dearlove said.",
      "On Iran, responding to Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will hold direct talks with Tehran over its nuclear program, Dearlove says he believes the administration will \u201cdemand a very high price\u201d \u2014 namely that Iran give up its entire nuclear program, both for energy and weapons.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a bottom line for Trump and Israel that Iran must not have nuclear capability,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that if Iran were to try to weaponize or if the intelligence suggests that they are weaponized, then there would be a joint Israeli-American attack.\u201d",
      "Trump didn\u2019t rule out military action if the talks don\u2019t succeed, saying Tehran would have a \u201cvery bad day\u201d if diplomacy failed.",
      "Dearlove agreed: \u201cIf the Iranians don\u2019t negotiate, or if they mislead, which they\u2019re quite capable of doing, they\u2019re ones heading for a crisis.\u201d",
      "Dearlove was head of MI6 when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, and was later criticized by a public inquiry for his handling of intelligence alleging that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a key argument steering Britain into the war alongside Washington. At the inquiry in 2017, he described claims he was too close to the British government as \u201ccomplete rubbish.\u201d And, according to a BBC interview in 2023, he is among a minority of people who believe that Iraq did have some kind of weapons program, but that its components may have been moved into neighboring Syria.",
      "Looking ahead, Dearlove believes by far the biggest issue is how the West deals with China.",
      "\u201cPax Americana\u201d \u2014 the \u201cAmerican peace\u201d that has largely held since 1945 and is a byword for Washington\u2019s postwar global dominance \u2014 has \u201cdefinitively disintegrated,\u201d he said. In its stead, there has to be \u201csome sort of understanding between the United States and China,\u201d whose President Xi Jinping \u201cwants to create a world by 2050 which is aligned with China\u2019s value system,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cChina and the West are intimately intertwined: You can\u2019t take them apart, you can\u2019t disentangle them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s totally opposed to the Western value system.\u201d",
      "He characterizes Xi\u2019s Chinese Communist Party as \u201ctalking about global domination\u201d \u2014 something vehemently rejected by Beijing.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be some sort of international agreement which accommodates what I would describe as the two spheres of influence,\u201d he said. Otherwise, China is \u201cgoing to end up in a confrontation with the United States at some point in the 21st century.\u201d"

      "\u201cOf course I\u2019m very excited,\u201d said Salah, who joined from Roma in 2017 for 42 million euros ($50 million). \u201cWe have a great team now. Before also we had a great team. But I signed because I think we have a chance to win other trophies and enjoy my football.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great, I had my best years here. I played eight years, hopefully it\u2019s going to be 10. Enjoying my life here, enjoying my football. I had the best years in my career.\u201d",

      "Slot, however, said he knew for some time that Salah was likely to stay at Liverpool. And he praised sporting director Richard Hughes and the Fenway Sports Group ownership for securing the forward\u2019s future, which meant deviating from the club\u2019s policy of not handing players over 30 years of age lucrative new contracts.",
      "British media reported Friday that a cut in Salah\u2019s reported wages of 350,000 pounds ($460,000) a week was never on the agenda in discussions.",
      "\u201cMo Salah is such a great player that as a free agent he can go probably to every club in the world, wherever he wants to,\u201d Slot said. \u201cBut he stayed at our club.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf you want to sign new players or players who want to extend here, it is always a positive to see one of our star players over the last seven or eight years has made the choice to extend his contract. It also shows maybe how ambitious this club is: not only Mo, but the owners.\u201d",
      "Attention now turns to whether Van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold will follow Salah in committing their future to Liverpool.",

      "SO\u2019OUD ATEN, Egypt \u2014 It\u2019s a familiar story: The whim of a leader upends citizens\u2019 lives\u00a0and leads them into the wilderness.",
      "In ancient Egypt, Pharaoh Akhenaten was no different. Determined that his population should stop from worshipping multiple gods, more than 3,300 years ago he told residents to seal up their homes and workshops in the city of So\u2019oud Aten with mud and clay bricks and move to a new home, a leading Egyptologist, Zawi Hawass, told NBC News last month.",
      "\u201cWhen the king makes a decision, everyone has to obey the decision,\u201d Hawass said. \u201cThis is the pharaoh.\u201d",
      "So quick was their exodus that many left behind an array of items including jewelry, pottery, children's shoes and toys, as well as a pizza peel similar to those used to make bread by their modern day descendants \u2014 a treasure trove that is now being recovered by archeologists.\u00a0NBC News was given exclusive access to the latest findings.",
      "But much is still a mystery in a city that was only discovered four years ago by archeologists searching for a mortuary temple where animal skeletons were arranged for religious rights. Egyptologists may never figure out why a fish was covered in gold.",
      "\u201cNobody really can explain it,\u201d Hawass said, adding that around 500 statues of the Sekhmet, the goddess of healing, have also been found at the site, which he has dubbed the \u201clost golden city,\u201d in part because it thrived during Egypt\u2019s golden age.",
      "Today it is a sleepy patch of desert, surrounded by a metal fence, and a dusty road. Archeologists work in the blazing sun at the site where an artificial lake with boat moorings was recently unearthed, likely created to deliver and dispatch goods to the Nile.",
      "Its location though is hugely significant. Situated near Luxor, an ancient city in central Egypt, it is surrounded by historical monuments, including the Colossi of Memnon, the Madinat Habu Temple and the Ramesseum. During the 18th dynasty, this was royal Egypt.",
      "Hawass, who served as Egypt\u2019s minister for antiquities, said that So\u2019oud Aten provides important information about the high standard of living for artisans and craftsmen as well as \u201cthe daily life of the people,\u201d who were so well off that archeologists \u201cfound many showers inside the houses,\u201d he said.",
      "In the past few months Hawass said a set of administrative buildings akin to a police station or town hall have also been uncovered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a snapshot in time,\u201d said Salima Ikram, a professor of Egyptology at the American University of Cairo.",
      "Workmen just laid down their tools, she said, adding, \u201cTheir stuff is lying around. They\u2019re in the middle of making, you know, pegging out a cow hide. They\u2019re cutting out sandals, and suddenly, all of this.\u201d",
      "Another recent discovery, a sun image etched onto the wall of a room in the district of the city where spinning, leatherwork and jewelry production took place, appears to signal a shift in religious thinking over time, Hawass said.",
      "Then in his life changing ruling, Akhenaten decided that his citizens should worship Aten, who was represented by the sun, he said, adding that it was possibly the first historical example of monotheism.",
      "Others like Ikram, prefer to define him as a henotheist \u2014 someone who worships one particular god, while acknowledging the existence and potential worship of other deities.",
      "Akhenaten, Hawass said, was \u201chated\u201d by religious priests who profited from the worship of multiple gods.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to go to a place to worship Aten,\u201d Hawass said, adding that he chose a site known today as Tell-el Amarna, around 200 miles south of Egypt\u2019s capital, Cairo.",
      "He called the new city the \u201cRise of Aten,\u201d Hawass said, adding that he believed that he was inspired to build the city by his father, Amenhotep III, who ruled Egypt from 1391 till 1353 B.C.",
      "Queen Nefertiti, Akhenaten\u2019s far more famous wife, would have walked the streets alongside him, Hawass added.",
      "The move was a \u201creligious revolution,\u201d said Yasmin El Shazly, the deputy director of the American Research Center in Egypt, which , which offers financial assistance to some archeologists. \u201cWe know that during the reign of Amenhotep lll, the religion became increasingly solar. There is evidence of the Aten, but there are other deities as well. So we know that it was not monotheistic at the time.\u201d",
      "But mentioning other gods, even the major deity Amun, \u201cbecame almost taboo,\u201d she said.",
      "After Akhenaten\u2019s death the city continued to be used by pharaohs including Tutankhamun, whose nearly intact tomb was discovered in the Valley of the Kings by British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922.",
      "What the citizens thought about leaving their original home in So\u2019oud Aten remains unclear.",
      "By blocking the doors, Hawass said it appeared that they were thinking they may come back and they wanted to \u201ckeep it safe.\u201d",
      "But at the time, he said no one could raise their objections to the pharaoh. \u201cNo one can talk to the king,\u201d he said."

      "\"There was a lot of debris,\" Castillo told Noticias Telemundo in Spanish. \"At the moment the roof collapsed, it turned into a sea of \u200b\u200bemotions.\"",
      "M\u00e9ndez said areas to claim victims would be closed later Thursday. \"It\u2019s been very hard for everyone,\" he said as he expressed solidarity with the affected families.",
      "The Jet Set Club was once a bustling center for nightlife. The collapse turned the cultural jewel into a wreckage site, with more than 300 firefighters scouring the rubble and giant cranes removing pieces of the concrete roof.",
      "Other people who died include Nelsy Cruz, the governor of Montecristi province, former MLB players Octavio Dotel\u00a0and\u00a0Tony Cabrera,\u00a0Dominican fashion designer Mart\u00edn Polanco and employees of Grupo Popular \u2014 one of the country\u2019s largest banking companies.

      "\"Over the past few days, rescue teams have worked without interruption, removing debris, assisting the injured and recovering people alive,\" the agency said in a statement in Spanish. \"However, having exhausted all reasonable avenues for finding more survivors, the operation now enters a different, but equally sensitive and crucial, phase: the recovery of human bodies with the due respect and dignity that each victim deserves.\""

      "Official data from the 2021 Census showed that around 1.5 million people in England and Wales identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual or another sexual orientation."
