      "The Detroit Tigers\u2019 Double-A Erie Seawolves will be renamed the Erie Moon Mammoths after being picked by John Oliver of HBO\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- The Detroit Tigers' Double-A Erie Seawolves will be renamed the Erie Moon Mammoths after being picked by John Oliver of HBO\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight.\u201d",
      "Oliver devoted a May 4 segment to names and promotions of minor league baseball teams, announcing: \u201cWe are willing to use all of our resources and stupidity to give one Minor League Baseball team a total rebrand. We will give you a new team name, a new mascot. We will even throw you a theme night. It will be personalized and it will be bespoke.\u201d",
      "Two weeks later, Oliver selected Erie from among 47 team submissions. Oliver said the northwestern Pennsylvania team had given 11 reasons it should be picked, including the team had pioneered cotton candy hot dogs and pointed out \u201cThe SeaWolves play baseball nowhere near the sea.\u201d",
      "Oliver announced Sunday he had chosen Moon Mammoths, using Bob Costas' voice as narrator of a promotional video introducing the moniker.",
      "The name was inspired by the 1991 discovery of woolly mammoth remains by George Moon, a Summit Township resident who found a bone while scuba diving in Lake Pleasant, about 8 miles south of Erie. The mammoth remains are housed in the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.",
      "Erie, which has won the past two Eastern League championships, will be renamed the Moon Mammoths for games on July 19, Aug. 19, Sept. 12 and Sept. 13.",
      "Major League Baseball said Monday the team will wear jerseys with a rising moon with the team\u2019s name across the chest, a moon on sleeves and a patch with a woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "Oliver is expected to attend the July 19 game against Chesapeake, called a \u201cMammoth Fun\u201d night. The first 1,000 ticketed fans will receive a Moon Mammoths squishy toy and there will be postgame fireworks. George Moon was also invited to attend.",

      "The Glastonbury Festival is making headlines for controversy rather than music",
      "LONDON -- The Glastonbury Festival is making headlines for controversy rather than music.",
      "The likes of Olivia Rodrigo, Rod Stewart, Neil Young, Charli XCX, Busta Rhymes and Doechii played to tens of thousands onsite, and millions more on TV, during Britain\u2019s biggest and most famous music extravaganza. But it\u2019s little-known rap-punk duo Bob Vylan attracting politicians\u2019 ire \u2014 and a police probe \u2014 after leading a chant calling for \u201cdeath\u201d to the Israeli military.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time politics has collided with pop at the festival. For half a century, Britain\u2019s big political and cultural divides have found their way onstage at Glastonbury.",
      "The Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts, to give it its full name, was founded by Michael Eavis in 1970 on his Worthy Farm, 120 miles (some 200 kilometers) southwest of London. It\u2019s still run by the 90-year-old farmer and his daughter, Emily Eavis.",
      "Originally a hippie happening with a 1 pound ticket price (about 20 pounds or $27 today), Glastonbury has largely shed its counterculture cachet. These days, tickets for the three-day event cost close to 400 pounds. But it remains famous for its eclectic lineup, unique atmosphere and commitment to environmentalism and other progressive causes.",
      "This year\u2019s event drew about 200,000 people to see almost 4,000 performers on 120 stages, alongside film screenings and live debates on a variety of issues.",
      "Glastonbury was founded in a spirit of hippie idealism that has never entirely faded. In the 1980s, the festival donated some of its profits to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which protested U.S. nuclear weapons on British soil. It continues to support charities including Oxfam and Greenpeace.",
      "By the late 1980s, attendees included New Age \u201ctravelers\u201d involved with the U.K.\u2019s unofficial and anarchic rave scene. In 1990, some travelers clashed with security at the site, leading to significant damage and more than 200 arrests.",
      "Since then, the festival\u2019s security and organization have grown increasingly professional, sparking regret from some fans who feel it has lost its alternative spirit.",
      "The 2016 festival coincided with the U.K.\u2019s referendum on European Union membership, and the decision to leave the bloc \u2014 which most young people opposed \u2014 overshadowed the event. Many performers mentioned Brexit and the dispirited mood, including headliner Adele, who urged people to \u201clook after each other.\u201d",
      "Performers have often vented their opposition to politicians from the stage. In 2019, rapper Stormzy led the crowd in \u201cF___ Boris\u201d chants aimed at then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. This year, Irish rappers Kneecap directed the same expletive at Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "In contrast, then-Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was warmly received at the festival in 2017 after doing better than expected against the Conservatives in a general election.",
      "Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza has provoked heightened emotions that spilled over onto Glastonbury\u2019s stages.",
      "Before the event, some politicians called for Glastonbury to cancel a performance by Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap, whose pro-Palestinian comments, critics say, have crossed a line into support for violence.",
      "Kneecap member Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh has been charged under the Terrorism Act with supporting a proscribed organization for allegedly waving a Hezbollah flag at a concert in London in November. He denies the charge, and Kneecap has accused critics of trying to silence the band because of its support for the Palestinian cause.",
      "Kneecap\u2019s energetic set included plenty of pro-Palestinian comments and criticism of the government. But it was the act that preceded them, Bob Vylan, that caused a furor when a member of the duo led chants of \u201cdeath to the IDF,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "The Avon and Somerset Police force said officers would review video evidence \u201cto determine whether any offenses may have been committed that would require a criminal investigation.",
      "Michael and Emily Eavis said Bob Vylan had \u201cvery much crossed a line.\u201d They said \u201cthere is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s publicly funded national broadcaster is under fire for showing Bob Vylan\u2019s set, one of dozens of Glastonbury performances it streamed live online.",
      "The BBC said Monday that it should have cut off the broadcast after the \u201cantisemitic\u201d and \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d comments, and has removed the performance from its website. But the government is demanding to know what \u201cdue diligence\u201d it did on Bob Vylan before the broadcast.",
      "Some media experts say the broadcaster is in a difficult position. Steven Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster, said Britain\u2019s influential right-wing press,\u201d including newspapers such as the Daily Mail and The Sun, frequently attack the BBC, \u201cfor both commercial and ideological reasons.\u201d",
      "Right-leaning newspapers featured the Bob Vylan story prominently, and Barnett said that attention \u201cputs any political leader under enormous pressure\u201d to express an opinion.",

      "These are refugee children, some who were born in one of Africa\u2019s largest camps \u2014 Kakuma, located in northern Kenya, where more than 300,000 refugees\u2019 livelihoods have been affected by funding cuts that have halved monthly food rations.",
      "The children use the Acholi traditional dance as a distraction from hunger and have perfected a survival skill to skip lunches as they stretch their monthly food rations that are currently at 30% of the U.N nutritional recommendation per person.",
      "The Acholi people, mostly from Uganda and South Sudan, are among refugees who live in Kakuma camp, which was established in 1992 as a safe haven for people fleeing conflict from dozens of east African countries.",
      "For a moment, the melodious sound of one of the refugee mothers stops the playground buzz of activity as dozens of children sit down to enjoy the traditional dance performance.",
      "The colorful swings doting the community center at Kakuma\u2019s Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement were donated by a Swiss organization, Terre des hommes, which still manages the playground aptly named \u201cFuraha\u201d \u2014 Swahili for Happiness.",
      "But the happiness of these children isn't guaranteed now as funding cuts have affected operations here. Fewer resources and staff are available to engage the children and ensure their safety.",

The sky itself is no limit for this couple who have traveled into space, and expectations are about as high.",

      "Local flavor? You bet.",
      "Beyond that, the team of the world\u2019s fourth-richest man has kept details under wraps. Still, whispers point to events spread across the lagoon city, adding complexity to what would have been a massive logistical undertaking even on dry land.",
      "On Thursday, dozens of private jets touched down at Venice\u2019s airport as yachts pulled into the city\u2019s famed waterways. Aboard were athletes, celebrities, influencers and business leaders, converging to revel in extravagance that is as much a testament to the couple\u2019s love as to their extraordinary wealth.",

      "Not so for these nuptials, which have become a lightning rod for protests.",
      "Still, any desire to dampen the prevailing fever pitch has yet to materialize. Instead, the glitterati were set to party, and the paparazzi jostling for glimpses of the gilded gala.",
      "Whatever happens, it will be a wedding for the ages.",
      "Venice is famed for its network of canals, where gondoliers croon for lovestruck couples and even ambulances are aquatic. But water transport of everything from bouquets to guests makes Venice among the world's most challenging cities for a party, according to Jack Ezon, CEO of luxury travel advisory and event planner Embark Beyond.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very tight-knit community; everyone there knows everyone, and you need to work with the right people,\u201d said Ezon, whose company has put on a dozen high-end events in Venice. \"There\u2019s very tight control, especially on movement there with boats.\u201d",
      "It at least triples the cost versus staging the same soiree in Rome or Florence, he said.",
      "Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia was first to give an estimated tally for the Bezos/S\u00e1nchez bash: He told reporters this week the most recent total he saw was between 40 million and 48 million euros (up to $56 million).",
      "It\u2019s an eye-popping, jaw-dropping figure that's over 1,000 times the $36,000 average cost of American couples' weddings in 2025, according to wedding planning website Zola\u2019s annual report.",
      "Bezos\u2019 team has been tight-lipped about where these millions are going. When the youngest son of Asia\u2019s richest man married last July, performances by pop stars Rihanna and Justin Bieber pushed up the price tag.",
      "\u201cHow do you spend $40 million on a three- or four-day event?\u201d Ezon said. \u201dYou could bring headliners, A-list performers, great DJs from anywhere in the world. You could spend $2 million on an incredible glass tent that\u2019s only there for 10 hours, but it takes a month to build,\" or expand the celebration to local landmarks.",
      "There's no sign S\u00e1nchez and Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, intend to take over any of Venice\u2019s tourist-thronged hotspots. Still, intense hand-wringing about the prospect prompted their wedding coordinator, Lanza & Baucina, to issue a rare statement calling those rumors false.",
      "On Thursday, a string of water taxis cut through the lagoon to bring Bezos, S\u00e1nchez and guests to the Madonna dell\u2019Orto cloister as some onlookers cheered. Paparazzi followed in their own boats, trying to capture guests on camera \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom \u2014 as police on jet skis patrolled.",
      "Local media have reported the couple will hold a ceremony Friday on San Giorgio island, across the lagoon basin from St. Mark\u2019s Square. Associated Press journalists circling the island Thursday saw workers assembling tents and private security personnel stationed at every pier, including a newly built one.",
      "Media have also reported a reception Saturday in the Arsenale, a former navy base best known as a primary venue for the Venice Biennale.",
      "There are some who say these two should not be wed in this city.",
      "They characterize the wedding as a decadent display of wealth in a world with growing inequality, and argue it's a shining example of tourism taking precedence over residents\u2019 needs, particularly affordable housing and essential services. Venice is also one of the cities most vulnerable to rising sea levels from climate change.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 are protesting under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words referring to his space exploration company Blue Origin and the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "Greenpeace unfurled a banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square denouncing Bezos for paying insufficient taxes. Activists floated a bald-headed Bezos-inspired mannequin down a Venice canal atop an Amazon delivery box, its hands clenching fake cash.",
      "Authorities \u2014 from Venice's mayor to the nation\u2019s tourism minister \u2014 have dismissed the outcry, saying it ignores the visibility and economic boost the wedding brings.",
      "\u201cThere will be photos everywhere, social media will go wild over the bride\u2019s dress, over the ceremony,\u201d Italy\u2019s tourism minister, Daniela Santanch\u00e8, told the AP.",
      "\u201cAll of this translates into a massive free publicity campaign. In fact, because they will spend a lot of money, they will enrich Venice \u2014 our shopkeepers, artisans, restauranteurs, hotels. So it\u2019s a great opportunity both for spending and for promoting Italy in the world.\u201d",
      "As Amazon\u2019s CEO, Bezos usually avoided the limelight, frequently delegating announcements and business updates to his executives. Today he has a net worth of $231 billion, according to Forbes.",
      "In 2019, he announced he was divorcing his first wife, MacKenzie Scott, just before the National Enquirer published a story about an affair with S\u00e1nchez, a former TV news anchor. S\u00e1nchez filed for divorce the day after Bezos\u2019 divorce was finalized.",
      "He stepped down as CEO in 2021, saying he wished to spend more time on side projects, including Blue Origin, The Washington Post, which he owns, and his philanthropic initiatives.",
      "Sitting beside S\u00e1nchez during an interview with CNN in 2022, he announced plans to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime.",
      "Last week, a Venetian environmental research association issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d CORILA, which seeks protection of the Venetian lagoon system, said contact began in April, well before any protests.",

      "Lalo Schifrin, the composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, died Thursday. He was 93.",
      "Schifrin\u2019s sons William and Ryan confirmed his death to trade outlets. The Associated Press\u2019 messages to Schifrin\u2019s publicist and representatives for either brother were not immediately returned.",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \u201cCool Hand Luke,\u201d \u201cThe Fox,\u201d \u201cVoyage of the Damned,\u201d \u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d and \u201cThe Sting II.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe movie dictates what the music will be.\u201d",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan. But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \u201conly the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\u201d by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\u201cThe producer called me and told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it\u2019s going to start with a fuse,\u2019\u201d Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \u201cSo I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that\u2019s why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\u201d",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin\u2019s music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin\u2019s music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\u201cI remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\u201d Giacchino told NPR. \u201cAnd I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, \u2018Just have fun with it.\u2019 And I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cMission: Impossible\u201d won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996\u2019s first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand\u2019s Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band. Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie\u2019s quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \u201cGillespiana.\u201d",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965\u2019s \u201cJazz Suite on the Mass Texts\u201d while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV\u2019s \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \u201cTango,\u201d \u201cRush Hour\u201d and its two sequels, \u201cBringing Down The House,\u201d \u201cThe Bridge of San Luis Rey,\u201d \u201cAfter the Sunset\u201d and the horror film \u201cAbominable.\u201d",
      "Writing the arrangements for \u201cDirty Harry,\u201d Schifrin decided that the main character wasn\u2019t in fact Clint Eastwood\u2019s hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\u201cYou would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cI wrote a theme for Scorpio.\u201d",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\u201cReceiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\u201d Schifrin said at the time. \u201cIt is mission accomplished.\u201d",
      "Among Schifrin\u2019s conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California\u2019s Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \u201cChristmas in Vienna\u201d in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \u201cLetters from Argentina,\u201d nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event\u2019s 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \u201cSongs of the Aztecs.\u201d The work premiered at Mexico\u2019s Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site\u2019s Aztec temple.",
      "\u201cI found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \u201cBut the real answer is that there\u2019s something magic about it. ... There\u2019s something magic in the art of music anyway.\u201d",
      "In addition to his sons, he\u2019s survived by his daughter, Frances, and wife, Donna.",

    "story": [
      "Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, has died at 91",
      "NEW YORK -- Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91.",
      "Moyer died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. He did not cite Moyers' cause of death.",
      "Moyer\u2019s career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson\u2019s press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \u201cThe CBS Evening News\u201d and chief correspondent for \u201cCBS Reports.\u201d",
      "But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV\u2019s most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.",
      "In 1988, Moyers produced \u201cThe Secret Government\u201d about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \u201cJoseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\u201d a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.",
      "His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men\u2019s Movement, and his 1993 series \u201cHealing and the Mind\u201d had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.",
      "In a medium that supposedly abhors \u201ctalking heads\u201d \u2014 shots of subject and interviewer talking \u2014 Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \u201cThe question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\u201d",
      "Demonstrating what someone called \u201ca soft, probing style\u201d in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.",
      "From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn\u2019t necessarily deny.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people\u2019s ideas,\u201d he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d operating independently, outside the establishment.",
      "Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \u201cthe conversation of democracy open to all comers,\u201d he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\u201d he said another time, \u201cbut they\u2019ve chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.",

      "Bruce Springsteen isn't the only musician to complete or launch anticipated album projects, then to see it never see the light of day",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea that Bruce Springsteen wrote, recorded and ultimately shelved entire albums of music may seem odd to the casual listener. Why put yourself through all that work for nothing?",
      "Yet \u201clost albums\u201d are embedded in music industry lore. Some were literally lost. Some remained unfinished or unreleased because of tragedy, shortsighted executives or creators who were perfectionist \u2014 or had short attention spans.",
      "Often, the music is eventually made public, like Springsteen is doing now, although out of context from the times in which it was originally made.",
      "So in honor of Springsteen's 83-song \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums\u201d box set being released Friday, The Associated Press has collected 10 examples of albums that were meant to be but weren't.",
      "Back in the news with the death of Brian Wilson, this album \u201cinvented the category of the lost masterpiece in popular music,\u201d says Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. Some of the material that surfaced suggested Wilson, the Beach Boys' chief writer, was well on his way: the majestic single \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d the centerpiece \u201cHeroes and Villains\u201d and the reflective \u201cSurf's Up.\u201d Wilson succumbed to internal competitive pressure worsened by mental illness and drug abuse while making it in 1966 and 1967, eventually aborting the project. He later finished it as a solo album backed by the Wondermints in 2004. The better-known songs were joined with some psychedelic-era curios that displayed Wilson's melodic sense and matchless ability as a vocal arranger, along with lyrics that some fellow Beach Boys worried were too \u201cout there.\u201d",
      "The mercurial Prince pulled back this disc, set for release in December 1987, at the last minute. Some promo copies had already slipped out, and it was so widely bootlegged that when Warner Bros. officially put it out in limited release in 1994, the company billed it as \u201cThe Legendary Black Album.\u201d Encased in an all-black sleeve, the project was said to be Prince's nod to Black fans who may have felt they had lost him to a pop audience. It's almost nonstop funk, including a lascivious Cindy Crawford tribute and the workout \u201cSuperfunkycalifragisexy.\u201d The maestro's instincts were well-placed, though. Coming after \u201cSign O' the Times\u201d \u2014 arguably his peak \u2014 this would have felt like a minor project.",
      "Written and recorded in 2003, Green Day's \u201cCigarettes and Valentines\u201d was actually lost; someone apparently stole the master tapes. Feeling on a creative roll, the rock trio decided against recreating what they'd done and pressed on with new material. Smart move. The result was \u201cAmerican Idiot,\u201d the band's best work. Perhaps the robbery was \u201cjust a sign that we made a crappy record and we should make a better one,\u201d songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong told MTV. The title cut later surfaced on a 2010 live album. The rest was lost to time.",
      "To say anticipation was high for Dr. Dre\u2019s third album when he started recording in 2002 puts it mildly. The theme disc about a hitman, which Dre described as a \u201chip-hop musical,\u201d had an all-star squad of contributors including Eminem, 50 Cent, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes and Kendrick Lamar. \u201cI\u2019d describe it as the most advanced rap album musically and lyrically we\u2019ll probably ever have a chance to listen to,\u201d co-producer Scott Storch told MTV. But we never have. When he announced a different third album in 2015, Dre explained on his radio show what happened to \u201cDetox\u201d: \u201cI didn\u2019t like it. It wasn\u2019t good. ... I worked my ass off on it, and I don\u2019t think I did a good enough job.\u201d",
      "A series of unfinished demos, \u201cBlack Gold\u201d was a taste of where guitar god Jimi Hendrix might have gone creatively if he hadn't died at 27 in 1970. He was composing a song suite about an animated Black superhero, says Tom Maxwell, whose podcast \u201cShelved\u201d unearths stories behind lost music. Hendrix sent a tape of his work to longtime drummer Mitch Mitchell for advice on fleshing it out. That music was set aside at Mitchell's home and forgotten for two decades after Hendrix died. To date, Hendrix's estate has made only one of these recordings public, a song called \u201cSuddenly November Morning.\u201d Hendrix, after clearing his throat, slips in and out of falsetto while accompanying himself on an acoustic guitar.",
      "Written while Yoko Ono was separated from John Lennon during his infamous \u201clost weekend\u201d in 1973-74, \u201cA Story\u201d had the potential of changing the musical narrative around her. It was a strong album \u2014 without the avant-garde stylings that made Ono a challenge for mainstream listeners \u2014 recorded with musicians who worked on Lennon's \u201cWalls & Bridges.\u201d Maxwell calls it \u201can emancipation manifesto\u201d that was set aside when Ono reconciled with Lennon. She's never publicly explained why, Maxwell says, although one song seems clearly about an affair she had while Lennon was away. Some of the material from \u201cA Story\u201d was included as part of the \u201cOnobox\u201d project that came out in 1992, and the album was released separately in 1997. Ono also re-recorded some of its songs in 1980, and Lennon was holding a tape of her composition \u201cIt Happened\u201d when he was shot and killed. In it, she sings about an unspecified, seemingly traumatic event: \u201cIt happened at a time of my life when I least expected.\u201d That wasn't even the most chilling premonition. Her song \u201cO'Oh\u201d ended with firecrackers that sound like gunshots. It was left off the 1997 release.",
      "Guns N' Roses was at the top of the hard rock world when they began recording a new album in 1994. It didn't go well. Inconclusive sessions slogged on for years, and all but singer Axl Rose left the group. Recording costs exceeded a staggering $13 million, by some accounts the most expensive rock album ever. One witness told The New York Times in 2005: \u201cWhat Axl wanted to do was to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. You could go on indefinitely, which is what they've done.\u201d When \u201cChinese Democracy\u201d was finally released in 2008, the world yawned.",
      "Not even a decade after the triumph of \u201cWhat's Going On,\u201d Marvin Gaye was floundering. His \u201cHere, My Dear\u201d divorce album flopped, he struggled with drugs and searched for relevance in the disco era. The single \u201cEgo Tripping Out,\u201d meant to herald a new album, laid bare the problems: Over a melody cribbed from Donna Summer's \u201cHot Stuff,\u201d the famously cool \u201cLove Man\u201d boasted like an insecure rapper. He scrapped the album, repurposing some its material for the 1981 disc \u201cIn Our Lifetime,\u201d a process so fraught he bitterly left his longtime label Motown. Gaye went to CBS, made a huge comeback with \u201cSexual Healing,\u201d then was shot dead by his father in 1984.",
      "Neil Young rivals Prince in the volume of material left in his vault, and he's been systematically releasing much of it. The mostly acoustic \u201cHomegrown\u201d was recorded as 1974 bled into 1975, during Young's breakup with actor Carrie Snodgress. Instead of releasing it in 1975, he put out another heartbreak album, the well-regarded \u201cTonight's the Night,\u201d about losing friends to drug abuse. When Young finally dropped \u201cHomegrown\u201d in 2020, he wrote in his blog, \u201cSometimes life hurts. This is the one that got away.\u201d",
      "Of the discs included in Springsteen's \u201cTracks II\u201d set, this was reportedly the closest to being released, in the spring of 1995. After the success of the Oscar-winning song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia,\u201d Springsteen recorded an album in the same vein, with a synthesizer and West Coast rap-inspired drum loops setting the musical motif. Strikingly contemporary for its time, Springsteen ultimately felt it was too similar to previous releases dominated by dark stories about relationships. \u201cI always put them away,\u201d he said of his lost albums. \u201cBut I don't throw them away.\u201d",

      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years",
      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years. The next entry, and first since Daniel Craig's dramatic exit, may test that \u2014 but things are speeding up.",
      "On Wednesday, Amazon MGM Studio announced that Denis Villeneuve will direct the 26th Bond movie, putting the franchise in the hands of one of the most respected big-budget filmmakers. Here's what to know about that decision, and where things stand for 007.",
      "Villeneuve, the 57-year-old French Canadian director, edged out other filmmakers who were reportedly eyed for the gig, including Edward Berger (\u201cConclave\u201d) and Paul King (\u201cPaddington 2\u201d). Since emerging with 2010's \u201cIncendies,\" Villeneuve has established himself as a steward of cinematic IP (\"Blade Runner 2049,\" \u201cDune\u201d) and a specialist in dark, doom-laden spectacle (\"Sicaro,\" \u201cArrival\u201d).",
      "\u201cJames Bond is in the hands of one of today\u2019s greatest filmmakers,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.",
      "The culmination for Villeneuve has been the \u201cDune\u201d films. His first two entries have surpassed $1 billion in box office and gathered a combined 15 Academy Award nominations, winning seven. Villeneuve is expected to begin shooting the third \u201cDune\u201d film this summer, with a cast including Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Zendaya and Javier Bardem.",
      "\"I\u2019m a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he\u2019s sacred territory,\u201d said Villeneuve. \u201cI intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.\u201d",
      "Amazon, which bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $8.5 billion, hasn't set a release date yet or announced a screenwriter. Producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman are shepherding the movie for the first time. In February, Amazon MGM Studios secured creative control of the franchise from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, whose family has presided over Bond since the first film, 1962's \u201cDr. No.\u201d",
      "The most likely timing would be production starting in 2026 and the film being released sometime in 2027.",
      "No new 007 has been named, but that hasn't stopped rumors and conjecture from running rampant.",
      "It's pure speculation buts oddsmakers have a few expected contenders for the martini-sipping role. Those include Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Theo James, Aaron Pierre, Henry Cavill, James Norton and Jack Lowden. Expectations are that the new Bond will remain male and British, but producers have said nothing publicly to tip their hand.",
      "Whoever it is will have big shoes to fill. In his five-film, 15-year stretch in the tuxedo, Daniel Craig was widely seen as one of the best Bonds, including the high point of \u201cSkyfall\u201d (2012) and the swan song of \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d (2021).",
      "Since Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli obtained the movie rights to Ian Fleming's books, James Bond has been a family business. That didn't change after Amazon bought MGM, but it did earlier this year when Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli agreed to let the studio take creative control.",
      "That handoff stoked concern from many Bond fans that 007 would be picked apart for spinoffs, series and the kind of intellectual property strip mining Hollywood has been known for in other franchises like \u201cStar Wars.\u201d So far, though, Amazon MGM has made no announcement about any spinoffs, and is prioritizing the 26th Bond movie.",

      "A prosecutor began two days of closing arguments at Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs' sex trafficking trial by telling a jury that the music mogul used \u201cpower, violence and fear\u201d to rule a criminal enterprise for two decades",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u201ccommitted crime after crime\u201d but thought his \u201cfame, wealth and power\u201d put him above the law, a prosecutor told jurors Thursday as the hip-hop mogul\u2019s sex trafficking trial shifted to closing arguments.",
      "\u201cThat ends now,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to find the defendant guilty.\u201d",
      "Combs, 55, sat with his head down as Slavik highlighted testimony and evidence from the seven-week trial that she said proved sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and other charges. Wearing a sweater and khakis, he sometimes scribbled notes to his lawyers and shook his head as Slavik played one of his audio messages for the jury.",
      "\u201cOver the last several weeks, you\u2019ve learned a lot about Sean Combs,\u201d Slavik said, launching into a nearly five-hour presentation. \u201cHe\u2019s the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\u201d",
      "Among the proof, Slavik argued, was evidence that Combs kidnapped an employee, was involved in setting rapper Kid Cudi\u2019s convertible ablaze, bribed a hotel guard and carried out \u201cbrutal crimes at the heart of this case.\u201d",
      "Combs \u201cagain and again forced, threatened and manipulated\u201d his ex-girlfriends Cassie and Jane into \u201chaving sex with escorts for his own entertainment,\u201d Slavik said, her lectern directly in front of jurors.",
      "The prosecutor said Combs forced or coerced Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, and Jane, who testified under a pseudonym, to engage in dayslong sex marathons known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights\u201d with drugs, violence, or by threatening financial harm or the release of video recordings of some of the hundreds of encounters.",
      "\u201cUp until today, the defendant was able to get away with these crimes,\u201d Slavik said.",
      "Bookending the trial\u2019s start, jurors again saw now-infamous security footage of Combs hitting, kicking and dragging Cassie at the Intercontinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016 after she tried to leave a freak-off with a male sex worker.",
      "\u201cHe knew exactly what he was doing. That is sex trafficking,\u201d Slavik told the jury, adding that Combs was \u201cknowingly using force and coercion to get Cassie back to that room where the escort was waiting.\u201d",
      "Slavik said Combs \u201ccounted on silence and shame\u201d to enable and prolong his abuse. He used a \u201csmall army\u201d of employees, including personal assistants and bodyguards, to harm women and cover it up, she said.",
      "The theory of racketeering law is that \u201cwhen someone commits crime as part of a group, they\u2019re more powerful and dangerous,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant was a powerful man, but he became more powerful and dangerous because of his inner circle, his businesses \u2014 the enterprise.\u201d",
      "Combs and his inner circle \u201ccommitted hundreds of racketeering acts,\u201d she said.",
      "Members of Combs\u2019 family, including several of his children, watched from wooden benches in the packed courtroom. At one point, he gave them a thumbs-up.",
      "Since his arrest at a Manhattan hotel last September, Combs and his lawyers have insisted he is innocent, though they conceded at trial that domestic violence occurred.",
      "Combs \u201cwas abusive: physical, emotional, psychological, sexual abuse,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant doesn\u2019t deny the abuse. They just want to call it \u2018domestic violence\u2019 and claim it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the crimes charged.\u201d",
      "The defense will give its closing argument on Friday, followed by a prosecution rebuttal argument. Then, Judge Arun Subramanian said, he will instruct jurors on the law before deliberations begin.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers built their case for acquittal through lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Some testified only in response to subpoenas and insisted they didn't want to be there.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers contend there was no racketeering conspiracy because no employees agreed to join any conspiracy.",
      "In her closing, Slavik said employees repeatedly agreed to commit crimes for Combs, including delivering him drugs; accompanying him to kidnap his personal assistant; and locking Cassie in a hotel room after he stomped on her face.",
      "As Slavik returned repeatedly to the topic of Combs\u2019 sex marathons, jurors saw a slide that said \u201cThe Freak Offs\u201d next to a photo of him laying on a bed bathed in red light.",
      "Slavik reminded jurors of text messages and testimony that showed that the women didn't want to participate, including one in which Jane told Combs that she felt he gave her no choice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s dark, sleazy and makes me feel disgusted with myself. I feel it\u2019s the only reason you have me around and why you pay for the house,\u201d Jane wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head.\u201d",

      "Issey Miyake\u2019s menswear line has returned to Paris Fashion Week with a dazzling show at the Cartier Foundation",
      "PARIS -- As Paris wilted under the ruthless June sun, Issey Miyake sent out a battalion of intergalactic fashion soldiers at the Cartier Foundation Thursday, shimmering between art and menswear apparel in a spectacle where even the light was a player. The late-morning sun bounced sharply off the art museum's monumental steel pillars, forcing some guests to slide their seats to escape the dazzling reflections \u2014 an impromptu game of musical chairs set to a pulsing, kinetic soundtrack.",
      "This Paris Fashion Week season finds the Miyake house in the midst of transition. In January, Paris bid adieu to Homme Pliss\u00e9 \u2014 Miyake\u2019s pleated cult favorite that had anchored the city\u2019s menswear calendar since 2019 \u2014 as the brand shifted its focus to nomadic shows, most recently appearing under the Tuscan sun. The torch in Paris has now been passed to IM Men, the last line personally conceived by Issey Miyake before his death in 2022. Thursday\u2019s show marked IM Men\u2019s return to the Paris stage, under the direction of designers Sen Kawahara, Yuki Itakura, and Nobutaka Kobayashi.",
      "The theme, \u201cDancing Texture,\u201d nodded to the ceramic artistry of Shoji Kamoda, but also to the surreal choreography on display. Models appeared to roll, tilt, and swing through the light, their movements somewhere between ballet and a slow-motion video game. Occasionally, a guest would squint, unsure if they were watching a runway show or a heat-induced hallucination.",
      "The crowd \u2014 equal parts Parisian cool, visiting editors, and those for whom a pleated culotte is a spiritual calling \u2014 dodged the sun's glare and fanned themselves in the heat, shifting for both comfort and the best sightline. The first model glided out in a mad, angular hat, setting the tone for a parade of tin man-meets-space ninja silhouettes designed for dance floors or distant planets.",
      "The clothes themselves looked as if they had been engineered for a new climate \u2014 or perhaps a new species. Surfaces peeled, rippled, and shimmered, metallic foils flashed against the sun, and jacquard weaves evoked the carved waves of Kamoda\u2019s ceramics. Vermilion and white motifs burst forth alongside a near-neon green, courtesy of upcycled fishing nets. A coat unzipped into a dramatic collar while some blousons and pants, when laid flat, formed perfect circles \u2014 a wink at Kamoda\u2019s wheel-thrown plates.",
      "Miyake, who died in 2022, loomed large over the collection, his vision unmistakable in every engineered pleat and playful transformation. IM Men is the last line he conceived \u2014 a living laboratory for innovation, risk, and occasional absurdity, now energetically interpreted by a younger team. Even in his absence, his legacy is alive in every joke, fold, and jolt of surprise on the runway.",
      "Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake rose from postwar Japan to become a global force, transforming fashion in the 1980s and \u201990s with his radical, sculptural vision. He pioneered heat-set pleating and created lines like Pleats Please and A-POC that blurred the boundaries between art, science, and daily life. Miyake\u2019s designs liberated fabric, allowing it to move with the body and imagination alike.",
      "Of course, the fashion house\u2019s embrace of the avant-garde still courts danger. Thursday's spectacle occasionally veered into excess, with kinetic art and sci-fi headgear that threatened to upstage the clothes themselves \u2014 a familiar Miyake risk. But the best moments, like a pared-back tangerine overcoat that floated past, proved restraint can sometimes steal the show.",

    "story": [
      "Eva Victor's \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is one of the more thrilling filmmaking debuts in recent years, writes Associated Press Film Writer Jake Coyle in his review",
      "The first thing to love about writer-director-star Eva Victor\u2019s extraordinary debut \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is how she, as the young professor Agnes, tries, and fails, to hide a tryst with her neighbor.",
      "Agnes lives in a quaint New England home where her best friend and fellow former grad student Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is visiting. We are just getting to know each of these characters when a knock comes on the door. Gavin (Lucas Hedges) stands outside confused when Lydie answers. Agnes rushes over to act as though he\u2019s mistaken her house for his, and not for the first time.",
      "\u201cGod bless your lost soul,\u201d she says, shooing him away.",
      "The plot of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d centers around a traumatic experience for Agnes that unfolds in a chapter titled \u201cThe Year With the Bad Thing.\u201d But it would be wrong to define \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d \u2014 or its singular protagonist \u2014 by that \u201cbad thing.\u201d In this remarkably fully formed debut, the moments that matter are the funny and tender ones that persist amid crueler experiences.",
      "Before her script to \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d attracted Barry Jenkins as a producer, Victor did improv and made comic social media videos. And the degree to which she\u2019s effectively channeled her sly sense of humor and full-bodied resistance to cliche makes \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d the immediately apparent revelation of a disarmingly offbeat new voice.",
      "The film unfolds in five chapters from across five years of Agnes\u2019 life, told out of chronology. That, in itself, is a way to place the \u201cbad thing\u201d of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d in a reshuffled context. Stasis, healing and friendship are more the guiding framework of Victor\u2019s film.",
      "The opening tenor of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is, in a way, the prevailing one. Agnes and Lydie (a terrific Ackie) are best pals whose jokey chemistry is as natural as their protectiveness of each other. At a dinner with their former literature grad students, Lydie clasps Agnes\u2019 hand under the table at the mention of their former thesis adviser.",
      "In the second chapter, the \u201cbad thing\u201d one, we find out why. In an unnamed New England liberal arts school, their professor, Preston Decker (Louis Cancelmi), is charming and perceptive. He recognizes Agnes\u2019 intelligence and seems to respect her \u2014 which makes his betrayal all the more shattering. When the location of one of their meetings shifts last-minute to his home, Victor\u2019s camera waits outside while day turns to night. Only when Agnes exits, ashen and horrified, do we pick back up with her as she gets in the car and drives.",
      "In the aftermath, the trauma of the rape spills out of Agnes in unpredictable ways and at unexpected moments. With Lydie. Visiting a doctor. At jury duty. With a stray cat. These encounters \u2014 some heartwarming, some insensitive \u2014 are both Agnes\u2019 way of awkwardly processing what she went through and the movie\u2019s way of accentuating how people around you, friend or stranger, have a choice of empathy. Most movingly, in the chapter \u201cThe Year With the Good Sandwich,\u201d John Carroll Lynch plays a man who finds her having a panic attack, and sweetly sits down with her in a parking lot.",
      "Agnes doesn\u2019t process her experience the way a movie character might be expected to \u2014 with, say, revenge or sudden catharsis. Hers is a sporadic, often absurd healing that includes turning up at her neighbor\u2019s house to borrow some lighter fluid. Lydie is key. This is in many ways a portrait of a friendship, and a particularly lived-in one at that. What it\u2019s not so much is a story about sexual assault.

      "The sequel to the horror-comedy hit \u201cM3GAN\u201d takes a bold turn into action territory",
      "If you want to know how big an upgrade the \u201cM3GAN\u201d sequel has on the original, look no further than the very first scene. \u201cM3GAN\u201d was mostly set in a Seattle house, but \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d starts at the Turkish-Iranian border \u2014 with a murderous rampage in a secret military installation and the presence of Saudi intelligence, with U.S. Defense Department officials covertly watching.",
      "Two hours later, it's not clear if this is really an upgrade.",
      "Most of the same team that gave us the refreshing horror-comedy original two years ago have not only gone super-big, but also changed the franchise's genre, turning \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d into an action movie with two AI robots, two villains, FBI units, wingsuits, neural implants, a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d-style vault heist, exosuits, a 250-mph street chase in a supercar, a power grid disaster, a countdown clock, the United Nations and the fate of the planet at stake.",
      "If the evil doll M3gan in the first movie was responsible for the deaths of four humans and one dog, this time the screen is littered with the corpses of shootings, decapitations, severed limbs and laser slayings. There are double-crosses, impalings, blood splatter, cattle prods, tactical military soldiers, self-destruct sequences and insane close-combat martial arts. You can be forgiven for expecting a Tom Cruise appearance.",
      "What you won't get is much of the vibe of the original, which fused horror, cultural commentary and humor. This time, that's muted in favor of an overly ambitious, horribly convoluted plot that sometimes feels like the moviemakers just threw money at the sequel and tried to ape other franchises by going massive. The first had a bedroom feel; the new one starts, like we said, on an international border. The original's $12 million budget has been tripled.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d owes a lot to \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day,\u201d in which the robot killer in the first movie becomes the robot hero of the second. M3gan, it will come as no surprise, wasn't killed at the end of the original. She's just been laying low, waiting for her time to seize the day \u2014 and dance. Now she is reborn to fight another, better AI robot, played with sinister lethality by Ivanna Sakhno.",
      "\u201cM3GAN\u201d arrived in 2023 just as AI technology like ChatGPT was beginning to go mainstream. Director and screenwriter Gerard Johnstone turns Allison Williams \u2014 who plays M3gan's creator, Gemma \u2014 into a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of artificial intelligence as the sequel opens. One of the more intriguing questions the movie explores is if parents are gradually outsourcing their responsibilities to technology.",
      "Her niece Cady \u2014 the fabulous Violet McGraw \u2014 is now a budding computer programmer and rebellious. She has learned aikido and has a strong affinity for Steven Seagal, a running gag. Her protection is still the single focus of M3gan, who has apparently been in cloud networks between movies.",
      "Facing a global existential threat, Gemma is convinced to build a body for M3gan to go toe-to-toe with the military-grade AI killing machine known as Amelia. \u201cEveryone deserves a second chance,\u201d Cady tells her aunt. But whose side is M3gan really on? And what does Amelia really want?",
      "Some of the movie's best parts are when M3gan and Amelia face off. \u201cYou're not family to them,\u201d the new AI model says to the old. \u201cYou're just the help.\u201d There's some cool robotic dancing \u2014 a highlight of the original \u2014 and a return of M3gan's camel-colored silk sateen dress that became popular at Halloween.",
      "Johnstone has smartly kept the offbeat humor of the original, this time with clever nods to \u201cKnight Rider\u201d and a surreal use of the Kate Bush song \u201cThis Woman\u2019s Work.\u201d Jemaine Clement from \u201cFlight of the Conchords\u201d has fun as an arrogant tech billionaire, while Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps return as Gemma\u2019s tech teammates, this time crawling through ducts or getting choked almost to death.",
      "We wouldn't be here if someone had taken the advice of Ronny Chieng's character in the original movie: \u201cI want you to take this cyborg puppet show and put it in a dark closet where it belongs.\u201d Not after grossing $180 million worldwide. \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d was inevitable, but it didn't have to be so inevitably too much.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 for \u201cstrong violent content, bloody images, some strong language, sexual material and brief drug references.\u201d Running time: 120 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "Country singer Parker McCollum will release his fifth studio album on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- Imagine you come from a small town in Texas and you have big dreams of being a country music star. Imagine those aspirations come true, tenfold: You win a couple Academy of Country Music Awards, a CMT Music Award and you have a couple platinum singles to your name. What's next?",
      "If you're Parker McCollum, it's new challenges. Surpassing his wildest expectations meant reveling in the carte blanche that follows \u2014 the freedom to do whatever you want. For the 33-year-old singer, that's the release of his fifth full-length project, a self-titled album out Friday.",
      "\u201cI would hang my hat on this record seven days a week,\u201d he says of the album. \u201cIt's just the most focused I've ever been.\u201d",
      "He's self-assured now, but the road to \u201cParker McCollum,\u201d the album, wasn't so steady. He originally recorded half a full-length with his longtime collaborator, producer Jon Randall. It wasn't working. \u201cI was comfortable,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cI was like, \u2018I gotta go get as uncomfortable as I can.\u201d\u2019",
      "So, he scrapped what he had, went to New York, worked with a new producer, Frank Liddell (Miranda Lambert, Lee Ann Womack, Chris Knight), and recorded what became the final album in a week.",
      "\u201cIt sounds absolutely ridiculous when you say it out loud,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cThat\u2019s a crazy way to do it, but I think it worked.\u201d",
      "It helped that McCollum had most of the songs written. \u201cI wrote \u2018Permanent Headphones\u2019 when I was 15. I wrote \u2018My Blue\u2019 in 2019. I wrote a lot of songs last year,\u201d he says. Still, they cut \u201ca couple songs a day.\u201d He credits Liddell for pulling the best songs out of him, as well as New York's industrious energy, for helping him realize the record.",
      "\u201cI'm glowing when I'm there,\u201d he says of the city. \u201cWhen I was in high school dreaming about being on a major label cutting records, you know, 'It\u2019s going to be in New York City and it\u2019s gonna be ... like a movie. And, you know, I just decided to try and actually do that.\u201d",
      "The album possesses that vigor, from the slow-building, John Mayer-esq. \u201cNew York Is On Fire\u201d to more country-and-then-some fare: \u201cSolid Country Gold,\u201d \u201cSunny Days,\u201d and \u201cWhat Kinda Man.\u201d",
      "There's also a spirited cover of Danny O\u2019Keefe's folk classic \u201cGood Time Charlie\u2019s Got The Blues\u201d with fellow Texan singer Cody Johnson, the album's sole feature. \u201cI've played that song my entire life,\u201d McCollum says.",
      "He thought, \u201cThat song is going to be cut at some point or another in my career. Might as well make it now.\u201d",
      "The narrative opener \u201cMy Blue\u201d was the first song McCollum and Liddell recorded in the studio, and it was \u201ca breeze,\u201d as McCollum describes it, \"And the worst thing happened that could have possibly happened.\u201d They thought the rest of the process would be effortless, but that's not how it goes. \u201cIt was just an absolute emotional grind for the next six and a half days. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d",
      "That led to experimentation, too. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a country singer. And the more that I listen to what I do, I\u2019m like, \u2018This doesn\u2019t really sound like country music to me,\u2019 which is hard to put your thumb on nowadays, of course, what country music really is. It\u2019s just not as narrow as it used to be. But I\u2019m like, I just don\u2019t really even care anymore. You know, maybe I\u2019m not a country singer. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t give a (expletive) anymore. Whatever it is that I do sound like, you know, that\u2019s what I wanna do.\u201d",
      "As long as the songs \u201cmake you feel something.\u201d",
      "That's something fans have long connected to, since the release of his debut, \u201cThe Limestone Kid,\u201d a decade ago.",
      "\u201cIt really eats at me to put out music that hits you where music hits me,\u201d he says. \u201cI really enjoy that chase and that journey of, \u2018Am I going to write songs that are good enough?\u2019 ... I\u2019m trying to find those answers.\u201d",

      "Venetian activists say they are planning a boisterous but peaceful protest during this weekend's wedding between multi-billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice",
      "VENICE, Italy -- This weekend's star-studded Venice wedding of multi-billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez has galvanized activist groups that are protesting it as a sign of the growing disparity between the haves and have-nots as well as disregard of the city's residents.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 have united to protest the multi-day event under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words also referring to the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "They have staged small-scale protests, unfurling anti-Bezos banners on iconic Venetian sites. They were joined this week by Greenpeace and the British group \u201cEveryone Hates Elon,\u201d which has smashed Teslas to protest Elon Musk, to unfurl a giant banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square protesting purported tax breaks for billionaires.",
      "\u201cIF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX,\u201d read the banner, which featured a huge image of Bezos. Police quickly took it away.",
      "There has been no comment from Bezos\u2019 representatives on the protests.",
      "The local activists had planned a more organized protest for Saturday, aiming to obstruct access to canals with boats to prevent guests from reaching a wedding venue. Then they modified the protest to a march from the train station after claiming a victory, asserting that their pressure forced organizers to change the venue to the Arsenale, a more easily secured site beyond Venice's congested center.",
      "\u201cIt will be a strong, decisive protest, but peaceful,\u2019\u2019 said Federica Toninello, an activist with the Social Housing Assembly network. \u201cWe want it to be like a party, with music, to make clear what we want our Venice to look like.\"",
      "Among the 200 guests confirmed to be attending the wedding are Mick Jagger, Ivanka Trump, Oprah Winfrey, Katy Perry and Leonardo DiCaprio.",
      "Venice, renowned for its romantic canal vistas, hosts hundreds of weddings each year, not infrequently those of the rich and famous. Previous celebrity weddings, like that of George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014, were embraced by the public. Hundreds turned out to wish the couple well at City Hall.",
      "Bezos has a different political and business profile, said Tommaso Cacciari, a prominent figure in the movement that successfully pushed for a ban on cruise ships over 25,000 tons traveling through the Giudecca Canal in central Venice.",
      "\u201cBezos is not a Hollywood actor,\u2019\u2019 Cacciari said. \u201cHe is an ultra-billionaire who sat next to Donald Trump during the inauguration, who contributed to his re-election and is contributing in a direct and heavy way to this new global obscurantism.\u2019\u2019",
      "Critics also cite Amazon\u2019s labor practices, ongoing tax disputes with European governments and Bezos\u2019 political associations as additional reasons for concern.",
      "Activists also argue that the Bezos wedding exemplifies broader failures in municipal governance, particularly the prioritization of tourism over residents' needs. They cite measures such as the day-tripper tax \u2014 which critics argue reinforces Venice\u2019s image as a theme park \u2014 as ineffective. Chief among their concerns is the lack of investment in affordable housing and essential services.",
      "City officials have defended the wedding. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro called the event an honor for Venice, and the city denied the wedding would cause disruptions.",
      "\"Venice once again reveals itself to be a global stage,\u2019\u2019 Brugnaro told The Associated Press, adding he hoped to meet Bezos while he was in town.",
      "Meanwhile, a Venetian environmental research association, Corila, issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d",
      "Corila, which unites university scholars and Italy\u2019s main national research council in researching Venetian protection strategies, wouldn\u2019t say how much Bezos was donating but said contact began in April, well before the protests started.",

      "The birds scattered in every direction as the first drumbeat thundered across the plaza outside Paris\u2019s Centre Pompidou, heralding the start of Pharrell Williams\u2019 latest Louis Vuitton spectacle",
      "PARIS -- The birds scattered in every direction as the first drumbeat thundered across the plaza outside Paris\u2019 Pompidou Center Tuesday, clearing the way for a different kind of flight: Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z swept into the front row.",
      "The star couple anchored a guest list at Pharrell Williams\u2019 latest Louis Vuitton spectacle that doubled as a map of contemporary culture now: Bradley Cooper, J-Hope, Karol G, Pinkpanthress, Future, Pusha T, Jackson Wang, Bambam, Mason Thames, Miles Caton, D\u2019Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Malcolm Washington, Jalen Ramsey, and A$AP Nast. If there was any question about the gravitational pull of Louis Vuitton under Williams, it evaporated before the first look hit the runway.",
      "This was no ordinary catwalk: Williams \u2014 half showman, half pop impresario \u2014 staged a cultural passage from Paris to Mumbai, fusing Indian tradition and modern dandyism into a punchy, sunstruck vision of the Vuitton man in 2026.",
      "In Vuitton\u2019s world, a show is never just a show. It\u2019s a takeover, a mood. On Tuesday, the Pompidou\u2019s iconic colored pipes served as a sci-fi backdrop for a set dreamed up with Studio Mumbai architect Bijoy Jain: a lifesize \u201cSnakes and Ladders\u201d board, alluding to both the child\u2019s game and the adult risks of fashion\u2019s global game. For Williams, the house\u2019s mantra of travel is less about destination, more about movemen. Up, down, sideways, sunward.",
      "The clothes? This season, they marched to their own drumbeat. Out came models in Indian-style chunky sandals, striped boxy shorts and blue preppy shirts with sleeves billowing like monsoon sails. Silken cargo pants shimmered in the sun; pin-striped puffers added a louche, almost Bollywood-kitsch edge. Cricket jerseys appeared with jeweled collars or \u2014 why not? \u2014 a puffy hood dripping with rhinestones. Blue pearlescent leather bombers flirted with the bling of Mumbai\u2019s film sets, while pin-striped tailoring riffed on both the British Raj and Parisian boulevardiers.",
      "If all this felt like cultural collision, that\u2019s by design. Williams\u2019 Vuitton has become a mood board for global wanderlust: the checked silks, the mismatched stripes, the trompe l\u2019oeil fabrics that look sun-faded by actual adventures. It\u2019s a nod to the itinerant dandyism that\u2019s fast becoming his Vuitton calling card. Less about nostalgia, more about now.",
      "But don\u2019t mistake the globe-trotting optimism for naivety. There\u2019s calculation in the chaos. Williams\u2019 references bounce from Kenzo \u2019s Nigo (his onetime collaborator) to Indian contemporary artisans \u2014 like the hand-beaded snakes slithering across shirts, or the sandalwood-scented linens that recall a summer in Rajasthan. The \u201cworldwide community\u201d Vuitton preaches is real, but it\u2019s also realpolitik: What could be more luxurious in 2025 than clothing that tries to please everyone and everywhere, without losing itself?",
      "Of course, with Vuitton, the accessories make the man and this season\u2019s bags, bejeweled sandals and hardware-heavy necklaces delivered the requisite Instagram bait, each a covetable passport stamp in leather or gold. It\u2019s maximalism, sure, but not just for the TikTok set: the craftsmanship, from sun-bleached cloth to hand-loomed stripes, rewards anyone who bothers to look twice.",
      "If there\u2019s a criticism, it\u2019s that sometimes the noise of references threatens to drown out the signal. Williams piles motif on motif, color on color, joy on joy, until coherence blurs into sheer, Dionysian energy. But maybe that\u2019s the point: In a season of global anxiety the Vuitton man chooses to strut, sparkle, and swerve.",
      "LVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury group, posted record revenue of 84.7 billion euros in 2024, with its Fashion & Leather Goods division anchored by Louis Vuitton still leading the pack. With a market value near $455 billion and over 6,300 stores worldwide, Vuitton remains the world\u2019s most valuable luxury brand. Even with a recent dip in sales, its scale and influence are unmatched.",
      "As the last look circled the Pompidou and the birds resettled, Vuitton\u2019s odyssey felt less like a fashion show and more like an announcement: the world is a game board, the ladders are real, and Louis Vuitton is still rolling the dice.",

      "Damson Idris was trying to tune out the noise, but that's a little difficult at a Formula One race.",
      "The British-Nigerian actor was in the zone, in character, filming the high-octane summer movie \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt at some of the world\u2019s most famous racetracks. While Idris\u2019 profile has been rising in recent years, after six seasons starring in the FX series \u201cSnowfall,\u201d there\u2019s nothing like being next to globally famous Formula One drivers and a Hollywood megastar to put things into perspective. He was pretty sure he was going to coast under the radar.",
      "Then he started hearing not just his own name from fans in the crowd but \u201cFranklin Saint,\u201d too, the name of his drug kingpin character on \u201cSnowfall.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny, because I see myself as a young actor who nobody knows,\u201d Idris, 33, said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Anonymity may already be a thing of the past for Idris, though. In May, he made a splash at the Met Gala, arriving in a full racing suit (branded with \u201cF1\u2019s\u201d fictional team name APXGP) and a Swarovski crystal-studded helmet that he and two ushers removed to reveal a second look underneath. The boldness and theatricality of the stunt made it one of the most talked about moments at an event where everyone is trying to stand out.",
      "And things are poised to rev up even more when \u201cF1\u201d opens globally Friday. Speeding into theaters on a wave of great reviews and the promise of a \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d-style spectacle, filmmaker Joseph Kosinski is pretty sure Idris is going to start hearing people shout \u201cJoshua Pearce\u201d at him too.",
      "That's the name of Idris' character, the hotshot rookie driver of the worst team on the circuit who's desperate to prove himself and hang on to one of the coveted seats.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very excited for people to see him own this character and go toe to toe with a giant movie star,\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cI think he can do anything. He\u2019s just super talented, and I feel like I\u2019m lucky to see him at the beginning of what\u2019s going to be a pretty stratospheric launch.\u201d",
      "Idris tries to seek out projects that challenge him and characters who are as different as possible \u2014 from each other and, especially, from him. Joshua Pearce fit the bill in a moment when he was preparing to say goodbye to Franklin Saint. After he read the \u201cF1\u201d script, the character even infiltrated his dreams.",
      "\u201cI said to myself, \u2018Man, no one\u2019s going to be able to play this part like I will.\u2019 I remember writing Joe (Kosinski) a letter and telling him that,\u201d Idris said. \u201cWhen we finally jumped in the cars for the first time, I was hooked. I was like, \u2018Yep this movie\u2019s mine. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s and I can\u2019t wait to give my all to it.\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cF1\u201d wouldn\u2019t just require playing a part. Both he and Pitt had to learn how to drive the cars at speeds of up to 180 mph. It took months of training behind the wheel the supervision of stunt drivers Luciano Bacheta and Craig Dolby, as well as physical training to adapt to the G-forces they\u2019d feel in the car.",
      "When it came time to film, which they did with special cameras attached to the cars, sometimes they were driving during breaks at real races with hundreds of thousands of spectators around. Every time you see Idris' or Pitt\u2019s face in the car, Kosinski said, they\u2019re really driving that car.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so insane. It\u2019s actually quicker in real life and it looks really fast on the screen,\u201d Idris said. \u201cIn a split second, a decision could be really detrimental. But I couldn\u2019t imagine doing this movie any other way. If it was on green screen, you\u2019d be able to tell.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a bit of art-meets-life symmetry wrapped up in \u201cF1,\u201d in which an up-and-comer teams up with a veteran. In the film, it\u2019s a reluctant pairing of two alphas. The mentorship is fraught, the lessons are hard-earned and the competition is not exactly friendly. Unlike Joshua, Idris is more than willing to get advice from those around him, whether it\u2019s producers like Jerry Bruckheimer and Jeremy Kleiner, his director Kosinski, or his co-stars, from Pitt to Javier Bardem.",
      "\u201cI speak to them every day and I ask for advice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main focus is on stories, playing characters that I can be proud of and range. That\u2019s everything I\u2019m setting out to do in this career.\u201d",
      "Acting was not always the goal for Idris. Like many kids in South London, he once dreamed of being a soccer player. Sure, the idea of being a renowned athlete held some appeal, but he also loved the sheer discipline it required. Then, at age 18, he realized he\u2019d never be as great as Lionel Messi.",
      "\u201cWhen I see him one day, hopefully I\u2019m blessed to meet him, I\u2019m going to tell him that he\u2019s the reason why I quit football, because he was so good,\u201d he said. \u201cWonderfully, acting is a subjective industry, so I can at least cheat my way into working with Brad Pitt.\u201d",
      "Cheating is, of course, a bit of cheeky hyperbole for an actor who studied drama at university and continued training at London's Identity School of Acting afterward. Since he made his stage debut in Ade Solanke\u2019s \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d over 10 years ago, Idris has been hitting the pavement like the rest of his peers. And he\u2019s just getting started.",
      "Idris recently wrapped filming the Tomi Adeyemi adaptation \u201cChildren of Bone and Blood\u201d in Cape Town, South Africa. Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, Idris plays Prince Inan in the African fantasy that co-stars Viola Davis, Cynthia Erivo, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Idris' idol and real-life mentor Idris Elba.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a namesake,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI feel so blessed to be able to say that I\u2019m like his little brother and I can call him and get advice.\u201d",
      "Next up, Idris will prepare to portray Miles Davis in Bill Pohlad\u2019s \u201cMiles & Juliette,\u201d about the jazz legend\u2019s romance with French singer Juliette Gr\u00e9co. He's also founded a fine jewelry line, named Didris, inspired by his mother, and is getting into producing as well \u2014 his production company has a deal with FX Networks and wants to make opportunities for emerging talents.",
      "And like his character in \u201cF1,\u201d Idris is learning to block out the noise. He knows that a film career is a long journey and there will be ups and downs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge moment, but I\u2019m fortunate to have so many people in my life that keep me grounded,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI\u2019ve soaked in information from people I admire who say the same thing during these higher moments: Pinch yourself, stay grounded, remember where you came from.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I\u2019m walking through this portal and into these next couple of years. I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m humbled, I am blessed and I can\u2019t wait to see what the future brings.\u201d",

      "A New York doctor has pleaded guilty to multiple counts of rape and sexual abuse",
      "NEW YORK -- A doctor pleaded guilty Monday to sexually abusing sedated patients at his New York City hospital and raping women who were unconscious at his home.",
      "Zhi Alan Cheng admitted to abusing seven women, including three female patients he was treating at New York-Presbyterian Queens hospital, the Queens district attorney's office said.",
      "Cheng, now 35, was arrested in 2022 after a female acquaintance discovered a video of him abusing her at his home while she was passed out. Searches of his home and devices uncovered video evidence of the doctor abusing women at his home and workplace, according to prosecutors. They also discovered liquid anesthesia.",
      "He has remained in jail and has been barred from practicing medicine. Cheng faces up to 24 years in prison at sentencing, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cThe level of violence and perversion displayed by Zhi Alan Cheng in sexually abusing multiple victims is compounded by the fact that he took an oath to do no harm as a medical professional,\" said District Attorney Melinda Katz. \u201cI thank the brave victim who initially came forward and exposed this abuse.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors alleged Cheng abused an eighth woman who was a patient at the hospital. He entered an Alford plea on that charge, meaning that he did not admit guilt but acknowledged that prosecutors have enough evidence to convict them.",
      "Most of the victims had no memory of the abuse and were sedated. One of the women woke up to in the middle of an assault after she had been sedated for a gastrointestinal procedure, prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors have said that New York-Presbyterian officials cooperated in the criminal investigation.",
      "\u201cAs caregivers, we are responsible for the safety and wellbeing of our patients. It is a sacred trust. The crimes committed by this individual are heinous, despicable, and a fundamental betrayal of our mission and the patients\u2019 trust. We are deeply sorry for all that the victims and their families have endured,\u201d New York-Presbyterian hospital spokesperson Angela Karafazli said in a statement.",
      "Chen's attorney, Jeffrey Einhorn, thanked prosecutors for the plea agreement and said: \u201cThe charges to which Mr. Cheng has pleaded guilty today are extraordinarily serious.\"",

      "But the justices took no action in cases from Arizona, Idaho and West Virginia involving the participation of transgender students on school sports teams. The court could say as soon as Thursday whether it will take up the issue in its next term.",
      "The high court ordered appellate judges to reexamine cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia involving access to medical care and birth certificates.",
      "The action was unsurprising because the court had set the cases aside until after it decided the Tennessee case, as typically happens when the same legal issue is being considered.",
      "The rulings all included findings that the restrictions on transgender people imposed by the states violate the Constitution's equal protection clause.",
      "In the Tennessee case, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional violation in a state law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria in people younger than 18.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 \u201cYou have no moral right to die.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s what Olha Kurtmalaieva told herself as she lay in intensive care, her body shutting down after emergency chemotherapy. Her cancer had progressed to Stage 4, meaning it had spread to other parts of her body and was now incurable. The pain was unbearable. The doctors weren\u2019t sure she\u2019d make it through the night.",
      "She was facing death alone in the Ukrainian capital, while her soldier husband was in Russian captivity in the more than three-year war.",
      "\u201cIf I die now, who will bring him back?\" Olha thought to herself. \"He has no one else in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Against the odds, she learned she was in remission last year. But even after multiple prisoner exchanges, including one that freed over 1,000 people, her husband, a Ukrainian marine, remains a captive.",
      "She hasn\u2019t given up. At nearly every exchange, she\u2019s there waiting, one of hundreds of Ukrainian women still trying to bring home their husbands, sons and brothers.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s everywhere in my life,\u201d Olha said. \u201cHis (photo) is on my phone screen, in my wallet, on the kitchen wall, in every room.\u201d",
      "Day and night, questions circled in her mind: \u201cWhat can I do to speed this up? What did I do today to bring him home?\u201d",
      "Olha was just 21 when she learned she had cancer. It was Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, Stage 2. The tumors were growing but were still treatable.",
      "\u201cAt that age, you\u2019re thinking: cancer? Why me? How? What did I do?\u201d she recalled. Her husband, Ruslan Kurtmalaiev, promised to stay by her side through every round of chemotherapy.",
      "When they met, in 2015, he was 21 and she was just 15. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t love at first sight,\u201d she said with a wide smile, eyes sparkling.",
      "Their attraction blossomed gradually that summer in Berdiansk, in what is now the Russian-occupied zone in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. Three years later, as soon as she turned 18, they wed.",
      "When they first met, it was not long after Russia illegally seized Crimea, Ruslan's homeland, in 2014, and also invaded eastern Ukraine. Ruslan, a professional soldier, had already served on the front line.",
      "From the beginning, Olha understood that life as a military wife meant constant sacrifice \u2014 long separations, missed milestones, and the uncertainty of war. But she never imagined that one day she would be waiting for her husband to return from captivity.",
      "When she describes Ruslan, tears well up in her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s kind, he has a heightened sense of justice,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cFor him, it was a matter of principle to return home and bring our Crimea home,\u201d she said, a loss she fully comprehended only after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "\u201cOnly when I lost my home did I fully understand him.\"",
      "Olha managed to complete only two sessions of chemo before the full-scale invasion. When her long hair began to fall out, she shaved her head. When she sent Ruslan a photo, he didn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cGod, you\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he told her.",
      "Later, he made a confession.",
      "\u201cHe told me, \u2018Yeah, I saw your hair falling out in the mornings. I gathered it all from your pillow before you woke up \u2014 so you wouldn\u2019t get upset.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she believed that losing her hair was the worst thing that could happen to her. But soon after, she discovered what real tragedy meant.",
      "Olha never made it to her third round of chemo.",
      "She stayed in Berdiansk, which was seized by Russian forces in the early days of the war. Cut off from medical care and waiting for news of Ruslan, she quietly began helping the Ukrainian military from inside occupied territory.",
      "\u201cThere was no oncology department in Berdiansk. There was simply nowhere to get treated,\u201d she said. \u201cBut honestly, I didn\u2019t even care that much at the time.\u201d",
      "In early April, she discovered that Russians had captured Ruslan and others from his marine forces\u2019 unit.",
      "\u201cI started to cry, but then I stopped myself. I thought, \u2018Wait. Is this something to cry about? He\u2019s alive. That\u2019s what matters.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she said, their idea of Russian captivity was naive. Only later did it become synonymous with torture, starvation and medical neglect.",
      "Olha left Berdiansk in June of 2022.",
      "\u201cWalking through your own city, but feeling like it\u2019s someone else\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s horrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were Russian flags everywhere. I kept Ukrainian music in my headphones. I was scared my Bluetooth might disconnect, and they\u2019d kill me. But it was worth it.\u201d",
      "She spent several months moving between cities, helping to organize peaceful rallies to raise awareness about Ukrainian POWs. Eventually, she settled in Kyiv. Throughout that time, she paid little attention to her cancer diagnosis, even as her health steadily declined.",
      "Then her condition worsened sharply. Her temperature spiked to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).",
      "\u201cWhen the doctor looked at my test results, she said, \u2018How are you even walking?\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Her lymphoma, left untreated during occupation, had progressed to Stage 4. Emergency chemotherapy began \u2014 and it hit her hard.",
      "\u201cMy second round of chemo was disastrous,\u201d she said. She developed an intestinal blockage, couldn\u2019t digest food, and was rushed to intensive care. \u201cIt was morphine all night from the pain. I couldn\u2019t stand. I couldn\u2019t sit. They moved me like a dead body.\u201d",
      "In the hospital, she overheard doctors say her condition was inoperable. Then a nurse came to her bedside and spoke plainly.",
      "\u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to try to restart your system manually,\u2019 she told me. \u2018But if it doesn\u2019t work, you may not wake up tomorrow. You must help us however you can.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was the thought of Ruslan, still in captivity, that helped Olha survive.",
      "In April 2024, five days before her birthday, Olha was told she was in remission. Now she juggles civic activism with running an online cosmetics store. She co-founded the Marine Corps Strength Association, representing over 1,000 Ukrainian POWs still in captivity.",
      "In close contact with former prisoners, Olha gathers fragments of information about Ruslan \u2014 she has had only one phone call with him in the past three years. She sent several letters but never received a reply.",
      "Like an investigator, she pieces together every detail. That\u2019s how she discovered that Ruslan had broken ribs and a crushed arm during regular beatings, according to the testimony of one of the POWs.",
      "As part of the psychological torture, he is made to listen to the Russian national anthem repeatedly. A Crimean Tatar and a Muslim, he is given only Christian religious texts to read \u2014 not the worst form of pressure, Olha acknowledges, but still a clear violation of his faith.",
      "One day, a Russian guard struck him eight times on the head with a hammer.",
      "\u201cThe other prisoners said they had never seen bruises like that in their lives,\u201d she said.",
      "Ruslan spent months in solitary confinement. And yet, somehow, he remains emotionally strong.",
      "\u201cHe tells the others about me,\u201d Olha said, her voice softening. \u201cOne of the guys who came back said (Ruslan) told him: \u2018She\u2019s your age, but she\u2019s got a business, she\u2019s strong, she\u2019s fighting for us. She\u2019ll get us out.\u2019\u201d",
      "That story stayed with her.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t afford to be weak. How can a marine\u2019s wife be weak?\u201d Olha said. \u201cWhat matters is that he knows I\u2019ll keep fighting for him \u2014 until the very end.\"",

      "A new Idaho law restricting public benefits for undocumented immigrants is facing a legal challenge",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- An Idaho doctor and four residents are challenging a new state law that halts some of the few public benefits available to people living in the U.S. unlawfully, including a program that provides access to life-saving HIV and AIDS medication for low income patients.",
      "The ACLU of Idaho filed the federal lawsuit Thursday night on behalf of Dr. Abby Davids and four people with HIV who are not named because they are immigrants without lawful permanent residency.",
      "The complaint says the new law is vague, contradicts federal law and makes it impossible for health care providers to determine exactly what kind of immigration status is excluded and how to verify that status for patients. They want a judge to grant them class-action status, expanding any ruling to other impacted people.",
      "Dozens of patients treated by one Boise-area clinic stand to lose access to HIV and AIDS medication under the law, according to the complaint, including several cared for by Davids.",
      "\u201cWithdrawing HIV treatment from her patients will not only have devastating consequences on their health, it raises the public health risk of increased HIV transmission,\u201d the ACLU wrote in the lawsuit. \u201cWhen her patients are undetectable, they cannot transmit the virus. Without HIV treatment, however, they cannot maintain an undetectable viral level and therefore are able to transmit the virus to others.\u201d",
      "The new Idaho law takes effect July 1, and appears to be the first limiting public health benefits since President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to enhance eligibility verification and ensure that public benefits aren't going to ineligible immigrants.",
      "The law requires people to verify that they are legal U.S. residents to receive public benefits like communicable disease testing, vaccinations, prenatal and postnatal care for women, crisis counseling, some food assistance for children and even access to food banks or soup kitchens that rely on public funding.",
      "Federal law generally prohibits immigrants in the U.S. illegally from receiving taxpayer-funded benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Social Security. But there are some exceptions for things like emergency medical care and other emergency or public health services.",
      "Idaho\u2019s law still allows for emergency medical services. But in a June 18 letter to health care providers, Idaho Division of Public Health administrator Elke Shaw-Tulloch said HIV is a long-term condition and not an emergency \u2014 so people must verify their lawful presence in order to get benefits through the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.",
      "The HIV patients challenging the new law include a married couple from Columbia with pending asylum applications, a man who was brought to the U.S. when he was just 4 years old and has Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status until next year, and a man from Mexico who has been living and working in Idaho since 2020.",
      "One of the patients said she and her husband were diagnosed with HIV in 2019 and immediately started antiretroviral therapy, receiving the medications at no cost through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. The medication has lowered the viral load in her body enough that it is now undetectable, she wrote in a court filing, ensuring that she won't transmit the virus to others.",
      "\u201cMy medication protected my daughter while I was pregnant because it prevented me from transmitting HIV to her during pregnancy,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The treatment allows her to be with her child, watching her grow, she said.",
      "Davids has been trying for weeks to get clarity from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare about exactly what kind of verification her patients will have to show, and exactly which kinds of immigration status are considered \u201clawful.\u201d But the state has yet to provide clear direction, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cI am really scared about what this means for many of our patients. Their lives will now be in jeopardy,\u201d Davids wrote in a May 30 email to the Department of Health and Welfare.",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- Federal prosecutors on Thursday charged Philadelphia's public schools with failing to properly inspect eight schools for damaged asbestos. The district agreed to have the criminal case deferred while a court keeps tabs on its response.",
      "Prosecutors said it was the first time a school district in the U.S. has faced such environmental criminal allegations.",
      "The district is charged with eight counts of violating the federal Toxic Substances Control Act for allegedly failing to perform inspections in a timely manner during a recent five-year period.",
      "Authorities said a judge must approve the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement, which avoids a grand jury indictment. If the school district complies with the relevant federal law, the government can eventually drop the charges.",
      "About 300 of the school district's aging set of 339 buildings contain asbestos, the U.S. attorney's office said in a release.",
      "Asbestos, a construction material in wide use until the 1980s, has been linked to cancer and lung disease.",
      "Investigators said some asbestos was improperly addressed and that schools have had to close as a result of asbestos problems. Prosecutors said the \u201clongstanding and widespread problem\u201d put students and teachers in danger.",
      "The deferred prosecution agreement says the school system has already improved policies, procedures and compliance regarding asbestos inspections and abatement.",

      "Five people who are incarcerated at a New Mexico county detention facility have measles, the state health department said Thursday.",
      "The Luna County Detention Center, located in the southwest New Mexico city of Deming, houses about 400 incarcerated people and has 100 staff members. State health officials say they are determining the vaccination status of people being held at the facility and are providing testing kits and equipment.",
      "As of Friday, the U.S. has 1,227 measles cases nationwide as of Tuesday, including active outbreaks in 12 states.",
      "The highly contagious and vaccine-preventable illness has been spreading in New Mexico since February, starting first in Lea County \u2014 just across the border from the epicenter of the historic Texas outbreak that has sickened 750 people since late January.",
      "New Mexico had 81 confirmed measles cases Tuesday, with Thursday's announcement bringing the total to 86. One state resident died of measles in March. The adult was unvaccinated and did not seek medical care.",
      "\u201cThe cases at Luna County Detention Center are a stark reminder that the measles outbreak in New Mexico is not over,\u201d said Dr. Chad Smelser, a medical epidemiologist with the New Mexico Department of Health. \u201cWe urge everyone in New Mexico, especially Luna County residents, to ensure that they are fully vaccinated against measles.\u201d",
      "Health officials put out an alert June 17 about measles being found Deming\u2019s wastewater system, an early sign that the virus was spreading.",
      "Pablo Montoya, the facility's warden, said in a statement that the first signs of illness started a week ago and all five incarcerated people who tested positive are now in quarantine. All in-person visits are suspended and court hearings will be held virtually.",
      "New Mexico has seen a large increase in measles vaccinations since February. More than 37,500 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine had been administered as of Monday, state data shows, compared to about 19,300 in the same timeframe of 2024.",
      "The measles vaccine is safe and it is 97% effective at protecting against measles after two doses. It is recommended as a routine vaccination for children across the U.S.",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s vaccine advisers are bringing up an old flu-shot debate: whether it\u2019s time to wipe out the last small fraction of those vaccines that contain a controversial preservative called thimerosal.",
      "It\u2019s a question seemingly laid to rest years ago, as studies showed no evidence that the preservative causes any health problems.",
      "\u201cThis is really a nonissue,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Here are some things to know about the substance.",
      "Thimerosal is a preservative used in certain vaccines since the 1930s, as well as in some other medical products.",
      "It was mostly used in multi-dose vials of vaccine, to prevent bacterial contamination as the vessel was repeatedly punctured to withdraw a dose.",
      "Questions about thimerosal were raised in the late 1990s because it contains a form of mercury.",
      "It\u2019s not the same as the toxic type found in some seafood, called methylmercury. Instead, it\u2019s a different type called ethylmercury that the body can excrete, O\u2019Leary explained.",
      "The amount of ethylmercury per vaccine dose was small and studies found no evidence of harm. Nor was it used in all vaccines. For example, vaccines for chickenpox, polio and measles, mumps and rubella never contained it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "But as a precaution, the U.S. phased the preservative out of childhood vaccines. Since 2001, all vaccines routinely recommended for children age 6 and younger in the U.S. come in formulas that don\u2019t contain thimerosal.",
      "The exception is a small subset of flu shot formulas in multi-dose vials that could be used for adults or kids. The vast majority of children, however, get their flu vaccination from a single-dose shot instead, O\u2019Leary said.",
      "According to the CDC, 96% of all flu vaccines in the U.S. administered last fall and winter \u2014 and an even higher share of those used in federally funded programs \u2014 were thimerosal-free.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a longtime antivaccine activist, and he has long contended there was a tie between thimerosal and autism.",
      "On Thursday, his newly appointed vaccine advisers were set to hear a presentation from Lyn Redwood, a nurse practitioner who once ran the antivaccine group that Kennedy founded.",
      "She will suggest that the remaining thimerosal-containing flu shots should be removed, according to meeting materials posted earlier this week. Among the claims were that they could be a risk to pregnant women.",
      "A new CDC staff analysis prepared for the meeting again showed no link between the preservative and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Some experts note that autism rates rose after thimerosal was removed from young children's vaccines in the U.S.",

      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee backed another option to protect infants against a dangerous virus \u2014 before turning to questions about fall flu vaccines and a preservative in a small fraction of them that some antivaccine groups have falsely tied to autism.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday took up protections against RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can dangerously inflame infants' tiny airways.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality. That first antibody, called nirsevimab, proved to be 63% to 76% effective against emergency department visits for infants over the last year.",
      "On Thursday, the vaccine panel voted 5-2 that another newly approved antibody shot, Merck\u2019s clesrovimab, should be used similarly.",
      "The ACIP, created more than 60 years ago, helps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available.",
      "Kennedy was a leading voice in the antivaccine movement before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official. He fired the previous 17-member panel this month and replaced it with a seven-member group that includes several vaccine skeptics.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 months and older to get a flu shot, and helps propel the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "Presentations prepared for Thursday's meeting suggest that the panel may do much the same this year. But there's also a flu-related vote that promises controversy.",
      "It concerns thimerosal, a form of mercury that\u2019s been added to vaccines since the early 20th century to preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials.",
      "Kennedy has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger. Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with limited exceptions.",
      "Thimerosal was placed on the meeting agenda shortly after Kennedy\u2019s new vaccine advisory was named last week.",
      "Before the vote, the committee will hear from Lyn Redwood, the former president of what is now known as Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 an antivaccine group founded by Kennedy.",
      "Some public health experts contend the thimerosal discussion will unnecessarily raise doubt in vaccines while possibly also making them more expensive and harder to get this fall.",
      "At the panel's meeting Wednesday, Chrissie Juliano, executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition, lamented the ouster of the former ACIP panel and the agenda of the new one.",
      "Her organization, which represents large city health departments, \u201cis deeply concerned that many routine vaccines may soon become inaccessible or unaffordable for millions of Americans if ACIP makes changes based on ideology rather than science,\" she said. \"The stakes are simply too high to let that happen.\u201d",

      "One key issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill in Congress is particularly daunting",
      "WASHINGTON -- One key unsettled issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump's big bill in Congress is particularly daunting: How to cut billions from health care without harming Americans or the hospitals and others that provide care?",
      "Republicans are struggling to devise a solution to the health care problem their package has created. Already, estimates say 10.9 million more people would be without health coverage under the House-passed version of the bill. GOP senators have proposed steeper reductions, which some say go too far.",
      "\u201cThe Senate cuts in Medicaid are far deeper than the House cuts, and I think that\u2019s problematic,\u201d said GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.",
      "Senators have been meeting behind closed doors and with Trump administration officials as they rush to finish up the big bill ahead of the president's Fourth of July deadline. Much of the package, with its tax breaks and bolstered border security spending, is essentially drafted. But the size and scope of healthcare cuts are among the toughest remaining issues.",
      "It's reminiscent of the summer during Trump's first term, in 2017, when Republicans struggled to keep their campaign promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, only to see the GOP splinter over the prospect of Americans losing health coverage. That legislation collapsed when then-Sen. John McCain famously cast a thumbs-down vote.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune is determined to avoid that outcome, sticking to the schedule and pressing ahead with voting expected by the end of the week.",
      "\u201cThis is a good bill and it's going to be great for our country,\u201d Thune said Wednesday, championing its potential to unleash economic growth and put money in people's pockets.",
      "The changes to the federal health care programs, particularly Medicaid, were always expected to become a centerpiece of the GOP package, a way to offset the costs of providing tax breaks for millions of Americans. Without action from Congress, taxes would go up next year when current tax law expires.",
      "The House-passed bill achieved some $1.5 trillion in savings overall, a large part of it coming from changes to health care. The Medicaid program has dramatically expanded in the 15 years since Obamacare became law and now serves some 80 million Americans. Republicans say that's far too high, and they want to shrink the program back to a smaller size covering mainly poorer women and children.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans are \u201ctrying to take away healthcare from tens of millions of Americans.\u201d Democrats are uniformly opposed to what they call the \u201cbig, ugly bill.\u201d",
      "Much of the health care cost savings would come from new 80-hour-a-month work requirements on those who receive Medicaid benefits, even as most recipients already work.",
      "But another provision, the so-called provider tax that almost all the states impose to some degree on hospitals and others that serve Medicaid patients, is drawing particular concern for potential cuts to rural hospitals.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said several senators spoke up Wednesday during a private meeting indicating they were not yet ready to start voting. \u201cThat\u2019ll depend if we land the plane on rural hospitals,\u201d he said.",
      "States impose the taxes as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics decry the system as a type of \u201claundering\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide the health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the provider taxes at current levels, while the Senate proposal goes deeper by reducing the tax that some states are able to impose.",
      "\u201cI know the states are addicted to it,\u201d said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan. But he added, \u201cObviously the provider tax needs to go away.\u201d",
      "But a number of GOP senators, and the hospitals and other medical providers in their states, are raising steep concerns that the provider tax changes would decimate rural hospitals.",
      "In a plea to lawmakers, the American Hospital Association said the cuts won\u2019t just affect those who get health coverage through Medicaid, but would further strain emergency rooms \u201cas they become the family doctor to millions of newly uninsured people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd worse, some hospitals, especially those in rural communities, may be forced to close altogether,\u201d said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the hospital group.",
      "The Catholic Health Association of the United States noted in its own letter that Medicaid provides health insurance coverage for one in five people and nearly half of all children.",
      "\u201cThe proposed changes to Medicaid would have devastating consequences, particularly for those in small towns and rural communities, where Medicaid is often the primary source of health care coverage,\u201d said Sister Mary Haddad, the group\u2019s president and CEO.",
      "Trying to engineer a fix to the problem, senators are considering creating a rural hospital fund to help offset the lost Medicaid money.",
      "GOP senators circulated a proposal to pour $15 billion to establish a new rural hospital fund. But several senators said that's too high, while others said it's insufficient. Collins has proposed that the fund be set at $100 billion.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be that big, but there will be a fund,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Hawley, who has been among those most outspoken about the health care cuts, said he's interested in the rural hospital fund but needs to hear more about how it would work.",
      "He has also raised concerns about a new $35 per service co-pay that could be charged to those with Medicaid, which is in both the House and Senate versions of the bill.",
      "\u201cGetting the fund is good. That\u2019s important, a step forward,\u201d Hawley said. But he asked: \u201cHow does the fund actually distribute the money? Who will get it to hospitals? ... Or is this just going to be something that exists on paper?\u201d",
      "A new analysis from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates the package would result in up to $2.3 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years, a markedly different assessment from other analyses. In contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s dynamic analysis of the House-passed measure estimates an increase in deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade.",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded warnings about a rare heart side effect associated with the two leading COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday it has expanded existing warnings on the two leading COVID-19 vaccines about a rare heart side effect mainly seen in young men.",
      "Myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation that is usually mild, emerged as a complication after the first shots became widely available in 2021. Prescribing information from both Pfizer and Moderna already advises doctors about the issue.",
      "In April, the FDA sent letters to both drugmakers asking them to update and expand the warnings to add more detail about the problem and to cover a larger group of patients. While the FDA can mandate label changes, the process is often more of a negotiation with companies.",
      "Specifically, the new warning lists the risk of myocarditis as 8 cases per 1 million people who got the 2023-2024 COVID shots between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old. The label also notes that the problem has been most common among males ages 12 to 24. The previous label said the problem mostly occurs in 12- to 17-year-olds.",
      "The FDA\u2019s labeling change appears to conflict with some prior findings of scientists elsewhere in the U.S. government.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously concluded there was no increased risk of myocarditis detected in government vaccine injury databases for COVID-19 shots dating back to 2022. Officials also noted that cases tend to resolve quickly and are less severe than those associated with COVID-19 infection itself, which can also cause myocarditis.",
      "The FDA announcement came as new vaccine advisers appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met to debate the continuing use of COVID-19 vaccines for key groups, including pregnant women. It's the first meeting of the CDC advisory panel since Kennedy abruptly dismissed all 17 members of the group, naming a new panel that includes several members with a history of anti-vaccine statements.",
      "The FDA's label update is the latest step by officials working under Kennedy to restrict or undercut use of vaccines. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and a top deputy recently restricted annual COVID-19 shots to seniors and other Americans at higher risk from the virus. They\u2019ve also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products that require extra testing.",
      "Outside experts said the new warning is the wrong approach.",
      "\u201cThey are right to suggest that we need to consider myocarditis risks associated with the vaccine, but what they propose is exactly the wrong solution,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris, a public health specialist at the University of Washington. \u201cWe should be investigating who is prone to myocarditis to see if we can predict and mitigate that risk.\u201d",
      "Makary and several other FDA officials gained prominence during the pandemic by suggesting the federal government exaggerated the benefits of COVID-19 boosters and downplayed serious side effects, including myocarditis.",
      "Before joining the government, Makary and two of his current FDA deputies wrote a 2022 paper that said mandating booster shots in young people would cause more vaccine-related injuries than prevented hospitalizations from COVID-19 infections. The conclusion contradicted that of many leading vaccine and public health experts at the time, including at the CDC.",

Kennedy Jr.'s actions to date.",
      "\u201cThe secretary is doing the important work of leading a complex agency,\u201d Monarez told members of a Senate health committee that will decide whether to advance her nomination.",
      "Monarez, 50, is the first nominee for CDC director to require Senate confirmation. She was named acting director in January and the nominee for the post in March after Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon. Monarez is the former director of a federal biomedical research agency and a respected scientist, though she would be the first nonphysician to lead the CDC in decades.",
      "Monarez repeatedly said she had not been involved in decisions earlier this year to cut hundreds of staff and eliminate CDC programs, but that she would work to retain the agency's core functions and transition key programs to other parts of the Health and Human Services department.",
      "Her answers appeared to frustrate some senators, including Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, who said he had no questions about her qualifications.",
      "\u201cI've got questions about your willingness to follow through on your values,\u201d he said.",
      "In the two-hour hearing, Monarez was sharply questioned about Kennedy's recent move to fire all 17 members of a crucial committee that evaluates and recommends vaccines, his downplaying of the risks of measles during a nationwide outbreak and staffing cuts to a program that investigates lead poisoning in children.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the committee, sought assurances about the scientific integrity of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which was reconstituted by Kennedy to include vaccine skeptics.",
      "\u201cSomeone can speak as a critic, but there should be someone who's reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the safety of vaccines,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "Monarez said she strongly supported public health interventions, including immunizations, saying, \u201cI think vaccines save lives.\"",
      "\u201cThe ACIP has a very vital role to play,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it must make sure that it is using science and evidence to drive that decision-making.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think he has prioritized key public health activities for preventing chronic diseases,\" she added.",
      "If Monarez is confirmed, it would end a stretch of confusion at the Atlanta-based CDC, where, for months, it wasn\u2019t clear who was running the agency. The acting director's role was filled in part by Matthew Buzzelli, the CDC\u2019s chief of staff who is a lawyer and political appointee with no medical experience.",
      "Monarez holds doctorate in microbiology and immunology from the University of Wisconsin, and her postdoctoral training was in microbiology and immunology at Stanford University.",
      "At CDC headquarters in Atlanta, employees have said Monarez was rarely heard from between late January and late March, when Trump nominated her.",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",

      "First on the agenda is an awkward scenario: Kennedy already announced COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children or pregnant women, and his new advisers aren\u2019t scheduled to vote on whether they agree. Yet government scientists prepared meeting materials calling vaccination \u201cthe best protection\u201d during pregnancy \u2014 and said most children hospitalized for COVID-19 over the past year were unvaccinated.",

Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months who could have some protection if their mom got vaccinated during pregnancy, according to the CDC's presentation.",
      "It\u2019s one signal that this week\u2019s two-day meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices isn\u2019t business as usual.",
      "Another sign: Shortly before the meeting, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist stepped down from the committee, bringing the panel's number to just seven. The Trump administration said Dr. Michael Ross withdrew during a customary review of members' financial holdings.",
      "The meeting opened as the American Academy of Pediatrics announced that it will continue publishing its own vaccine schedule for children but now will do so independently of the ACIP, calling it \u201cno longer a credible process.\u201d",
      "The panel, created more than 60 years ago, helps the CDC determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available, such as at pharmacies.",
      "Earlier this month, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices. And a number of the CDC\u2019s top vaccine scientists \u2014 including some who lead the reporting of data and the vetting of presentations at ACIP meetings \u2014 have resigned or been moved out of previous positions.",
      "The highly unusual moves prompted a last-minute plea from a prominent Republican senator to delay this week\u2019s meeting. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the chamber's health committee, said Monday that many of Kennedy\u2019s chosen panelists lack the required expertise and \u201cmay even have a preconceived bias\u201d against new vaccine technologies.",
      "In a House hearing Tuesday, Kennedy defended his purge, saying the old panel had been \u201ca template for medical malpractice.\u201d",
      "Rep. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician and Democrat from Washington state, told Kennedy: \u201cI will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet.\u201d",
      "The two-day meeting's agenda on was abruptly changed last week.",
      "Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session on Wednesday. Later in the day, the committee will take up RSV, with votes expected. On Thursday, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations and on the use of a preservative in certain flu shots.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be dangerous for infants.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality.",
      "The committee will discuss another company's newly approved antibody shot, but the exact language for the vote was not released prior to the meeting.",
      "\u201cI think there may be a theme of soft-pedaling or withdrawing recommendations for healthy pregnant women and healthy children,\u201d even though they are at risk from vaccine-preventable diseases, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University who co-authored a recent medical journal commentary criticizing the COVID-19 vaccination decision.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 month and older to get a flu shot, and helps greenlight the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "But given the recent changes to the committee and federal public health leadership, it's unclear how routine topics will be treated, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher who has studied the committee.",
      "Thursday also promises controversy. The advisory panel is set to consider a preservative in a subset of flu shots that Kennedy and some antivaccine groups have falsely contended is tied to autism. In preparation, the CDC posted a new report confirming that research shows no link between the preservative, thimerosal, and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Gostin said the agenda appears to be \u201ca combination of what we would normally expect ACIP to cover along with a mixture of potential conspiracy theories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly are in a new normal that's highly skeptical of vaccine science.\u201d",
      "The committee's recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC currently has no director, so the committee\u2019s recommendations have been going to Kennedy, and he has yet to act on a couple recommendations ACIP made in April.",
      "The CDC director nominee, Susan Monarez, is slated to go before a Senate committee on Wednesday.",

      "Work locally to convince more residents to give up grass lawns and increase biodiversity with native plants, for instance. Help establish new green spaces, join projects to protect water, develop wildlife corridors, or decrease pesticide use to save frogs, insects and birds. Work to get the word out on turning down nighttime lighting to help birds and lightning bugs.",
      "\u201cI see people struggling with these emotions across the age range,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cI have parents who are themselves really struggling with their own feelings and really worried about their children in the future.\u201d",

They don\u2019t eat meat and have encouraged extended family to do the same. They recycle, compost and limit travel by air.",
      "\u201cI try to explain things to my son so he can at least have some understanding of how the world and the ecosystem works as a whole,\u201d Yu said. \u201cI do think kids are able to absorb that and turn that into some level of action.\u201d",

      "The kit is full of ways to help teachers support students\u2019 mental health and manage their own climate-related emotions. One of the exercises involves students documenting their interactions with the natural world in an environmental timeline. Laying it all out often stirs action, Reid said.",

      "\u201cLouisa Dunne died in a horrifying attack carried out in the place where she should have felt safest \u2014 her own home,\u201d prosecutor Charlotte Ream said. \u201cFor 58 years, this appalling crime went unsolved and Ryland Headley, the man we now know is responsible, avoided justice.\u201d",
      "Dunne was found dead in her home by a neighbor on June 28, 1967. The cause of her death was found to be strangulation and asphyxiation. She had also been raped.",
      "Investigators retained Dunne\u2019s clothing, including a blue skirt, and other samples from her body for further examination. They also recovered a palm print from a window which Headley is believed to have used to gain entry to her home.",
      "In 2023, the case was reexamined and the skirt was sent away for forensic testing in May last year. DNA recovered from the item of clothing linked Headley to the murder scene after his DNA was added to the national database in 2012 for an unrelated incident.",
      "Forensic scientists concluded that DNA from the skirt matched Headley\u2019s and the palm print was also his. Headley was arrested at his home in Suffolk in November.",
      "Headley was convicted of two counts of rape in the late 1970s, after he attacked women, aged 79 and 84, in Ipswich. He pleaded guilty to the charges in 1978 and was jailed for seven years.",

      "Marchant said he is working with the National Crime Agency to determine whether Headley may be responsible for any other unsolved offenses over the years. \u201cCrimes of this magnitude should never go unpunished and we will remain relentless in ensuring we do everything we can to advance other unsolved murder cases in the Avon and Somerset area,\u201d he said.",

      "LONDON -- Human rights groups lost their legal challenge Monday to the British government's decision to supply Israel with parts for F-35 fighter jets and other military equipment.",
      "The Palestinian group Al-Haq and the U.K.-based Global Legal Action Network alleged that the government broke domestic and international law and was complicit in atrocities against Palestinians by allowing essential components for the warplanes to be supplied to Israel.",
      "The government last year suspended about 30 of 350 existing export licenses for equipment deemed to be for use in the conflict in Gaza because of a \u201cclear risk\u201d the items could be used to violate international humanitarian law. Equipment included parts for helicopters and drones.",
      "But an exemption was made for some licenses related to components of F-35 fighter jets, which are indirectly supplied to Israel through the global spare parts supply chain and have been linked to bombing the Gaza Strip.",
      "While rights groups argued the U.K. shouldn\u2019t continue to export parts through what they call a \u201cdeliberate loophole\u201d given the government\u2019s own assessment of Israel\u2019s compliance with international humanitarian law, the government said the parts were distributed to a collaboration involving the U.S. and six other partners to produce the jets.",
      "Components manufactured in the U.K. are sent to assembly lines in the U.S., Italy and Japan that supply partners \u2014 including Israel \u2014 with jets and spare parts, the court said.",
      "Two High Court judges ruled that the issue was one of national security because the parts were considered vital to the defense collaboration and the U.K.'s security and international peace. They said it wasn't up to the courts to tell the government to withdraw from the group because of the possibility the parts would be supplied to Israel and used to violate international humanitarian law in Gaza.",
      "\u201cUnder our constitution that acutely sensitive and political issue is a matter for the executive, which is democratically accountable to Parliament and ultimately to the electorate, not for the courts,\" Justices Stephen Males and Karen Steyn wrote in a 72-page judgment.",
      "Compared with major arms suppliers such as the U.S. and Germany, British firms sell a relatively small amount of weapons and components to Israel. The Campaign Against Arms Trade nonprofit group estimates that the U.K. supplies about 15% of the components in the F-35 stealth combat aircraft, including its laser targeting system.",

      "Denmark, a nation of 6 million people, has about 9,000 professional troops. The new arrangement is expected to bring the figure up to 6,500 people doing military service annually by 2033, up from 4,700 last year.",
      "Under Danish law, all physically fit men over age 18 are called up for military service. Some people \u2014 both men and women \u2014 volunteer, and the rest of the places are filled by a lottery system that until now has only involved men. Women volunteers make up roughly a quarter of 2024\u2019s cohort.",
      "\u201cSome will probably be very disappointed being chosen to go into the military,\u201d Anne Sofie, part of Katrine\u2019s cohort of volunteers, said of the new female conscripts. \u201cSome will probably be surprised and like it a lot more than they think they would.\u201d",
      "The duration of service is also being extended, from four to 11 months. Conscripts will first spend five months in basic training, followed by six months of operational service, plus additional lessons.",
      "The move is part of a broader military buildup by the Nordic nation.",
      "In February, Denmark\u2019s government announced plans to bolster its military by setting up a $7 billion fund that it said would raise the country\u2019s defense spending to more than 3% of gross domestic product this year. Parts of the conscript program are being financed by the so-called Acceleration Fund.",
      "\u201cWe see a sharpened security situation in Europe. We have the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. We have focus on the Baltic countries, where Denmark is contributing a lot of soldiers. So, I think it\u2019s a general effort to strengthen the Danish defense,\u201d said researcher Rikke Haugegaard from the Royal Danish Defense College.",
      "But Haugegaard notes there are many challenges, from ill-fitting equipment and a lack of additional barracks, to potential cases of sexual harassment.",
      "\u201cFor the next year or two, we will be building a lot of new buildings to accommodate all these people. So, it will be a gradual process,\u201d she added.",
      "In 2017, neighboring Sweden instituted a military draft for both men and women after its government spoke of a deteriorating security environment in Europe. Norway introduced its own law applying military conscription to both sexes in 2013.",

      "China has reopened its market to seafood from Japan after a nearly two-year ban over the discharge of slightly radioactive wastewater from the tsunami-destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant",
      "BEIJING -- China has reopened its market to seafood from Japan after a nearly two-year ban over the discharge of slightly radioactive wastewater from the tsunami-destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant.",
      "A notice from the customs agency said the ban had been lifted Sunday and that imports from much of Japan would be resumed.",
      "The ban, imposed in August 2023, was a major blow to Japan's scallop and sea cucumber exporters. China was the biggest overseas market for Japanese seafood, accounting for more than one-fifth of its exports. The decision to lift the ban coincides with efforts by China and Japan to improve ties as both face economic uncertainty because of the American tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The nuclear plant at Fukushima was heavily damaged by a deadly tsunami that followed a huge offshore earthquake in 2011. Water still must be pumped in to cool the radioactive fuel. The water is then stored in what was an ever-growing complex of tanks on the property.",
      "After years of debate, the utility won Japanese government permission to discharge the water gradually into the sea after treating it to remove most of the radioactive elements and diluting it with seawater. Japanese officials said the wastewater would be safer than international standards and have negligible environmental impact.",
      "China disagreed and imposed a ban, saying the discharge would endanger the fishing industry and coastal communities on its east coast.",
      "Over months of talks, Japan agreed to let China take samples of the water for testing. The sampling has not found any abnormalities, the customs agency notice said",
      "China still opposes the wastewater discharge, but based on scientific evidence and analysis, it is allowing imports on a conditional basis from parts of Japan that meet China's standards, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.",
      "A ban remains in place for seafood from 10 of Japan's 47 prefectures, including Fukushima and nearby ones.",
      "Japanese seafood exporters will have to reapply for registration in China and all imports will have to include a health certificate, a certificate of compliance for radioactive substance testing and a certificate of origin, the Chinese customs agency said.",
      "Shipments to China are expected to resume gradually, Japanese government spokesperson Kazuhiko Aoki told reporters in Tokyo on Monday, noting the re-registration requirement.",
      "He said it was unclear how quickly scallop and sea cucumber exporters would return to China, because they had sought out other markets since the ban. But he predicted sales of sea cucumbers, a prized delicacy in China, would recover to a certain degree.",
      "Aoki said the Japanese government would continue to press for the lifting of the export ban on the other 10 prefectures.",

    "story": [
      "A jury in Australia has begun deliberations in the triple murder trial of Erin Patterson, accused of killing her estranged husband\u2019s relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A sequestered jury in Australia began deliberations Monday in the triple murder trial of Erin Patterson, accused of killing her estranged husband\u2019s relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch.",
      "Three of Patterson\u2019s four lunch guests \u2014 her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail\u2019s sister Heather Wilkinson \u2014 died in the hospital after the 2023 meal at her home in Leongatha, at which she served individual beef Wellington pastries containing death cap mushrooms.",
      "She is accused of attempting to murder the fourth, Heather\u2019s husband Ian Wilkinson, who was gravely ill but survived.",
      "During the nine-week Supreme Court trial in the state of Victoria, Patterson gave evidence in her own defense. The 50-year-old mother of two faces life in prison if convicted.",
      "It isn\u2019t disputed that Patterson served her guests the toxic mushrooms or that the meal killed them. But the jury must decide whether she meant for them to die.",
      "Prosecutors in the case, which has gripped Australia for two years, said the accused woman researched, foraged and served the mushrooms deliberately and lied to investigators to cover her tracks. Their case against Patterson included that she disposed of a food dehydrator after the fatal meal and reset her phone multiple times.",
      "The prosecution said she lied about having a dire medical diagnosis to ensure her guests attended the lunch, cooked individual pastries to avoid poisoning herself, and faked symptoms to make it look as though she fell ill, too.",
      "But Patterson\u2019s lawyers said the poisoning was a terrible accident caused by a pantry mix-up of store-bought and wild mushrooms, which she didn\u2019t know were death caps. The defense case was that Patterson wasn\u2019t as ill as the other diners because she induced vomiting after the meal due to an eating disorder.",
      "The accused lied to the police that she had never foraged mushrooms or owned a dehydrator out of panic, her lawyers said. Patterson denied telling her lunch guests she had a confirmed diagnosis of cancer.",
      "Justice Christopher Beale spent four days summarizing the case to jurors before their deliberations began, urging them not to be swayed by bias or prejudice, or by sympathy for the families of those who died. Patterson\u2019s lies, some of which she admitted during her evidence, could be used to assess her credibility but didn\u2019t mean she was guilty of murder, Justice Beale said.",
      "Prosecutors didn\u2019t offer a motive for the alleged killings and weren\u2019t required to. But they suggested a deteriorating relationship between the accused and her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, as well as her exasperation with her former in-laws, which she expressed to friends on social media months before the deaths.",
      "The defense said Erin Patterson had a positive and loving relationship with her lunch guests, who included her children\u2019s only living grandparents, and that she had no reason to kill them. Justice Beale highlighted in his summary of the case the fleeting and minor nature of the past disputes.",
      "Simon Patterson was invited to the fatal lunch but didn\u2019t go.",
      "A 14-member jury heard the case, but 12 were selected by ballot Monday to decide the verdict. The jury will remain sequestered, meaning they will stay together in court-appointed accommodation until they reach a unanimous decision.",
      "Late Monday afternoon, court staff told reporters that jurors had finished deliberations for the day and would return to consider the case Tuesday. The jury is not permitted to return a verdict outside of the court's sitting hours and members are barred from discussing the case outside the jury room \u2014 even with each other.",
      "Sequestration is rare in Australia and reflects public and media fervor about the case, with several news outlets publishing live blogs that covered every moment of the trial for its more than two-month run. The lengthy fixture in the town of Morwell, Victoria, drew lines of people eager to watch proceedings each day.",

      "Chilean Communist Jeannette Jara, the country\u2019s former labor minister, has won the primary election for left-wing parties with surprising ease, beating out a more moderate rival to clinch over 60% of the vote",
      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- Chilean Communist Jeannette Jara, the country's former labor minister, won the primary election for left-wing parties Sunday with surprising ease, beating out a more moderate rival to clinch over 60% of the vote.",
      "The decisive upset makes Jara, 51, the candidate representing Chile's beleaguered incumbent government in November elections, set to face off against center-right and far-right contenders who have surged in the polls.",
      "Because of term limits, the current leftist president, Gabriel Boric, 39, cannot run for a second consecutive term.",
      "Jara, a lawyer and member of Chile's Communist Party who was Boric's labor minister before resigning to run for president, secured 60.5% of the vote. The runner-up who had been considered a favorite \u2014 former Interior Minister Carolina Toha from the traditional Democratic Socialist party \u2014 took 27.7%.",
      "\u201cToday begins a new path that we will walk together, with the conviction to build a fairer and more democratic Chile,\u201d Jara wrote on social media. \u201cIn the face of the threat from the far-right, we respond with unity, dialogue and hope.\u201d",
      "After Boric's 2022 election, voting was made compulsory, adding unpredictability to this year\u2019s race.",
      "Preliminary turnout figures from electoral authorities showed that turnout was much lower than expected, with just 1.4 million people casting ballots. Chile has some 15.4 million eligible voters.",
      "Although Jara's landslide win represents the rise of hard-liners within Boric's coalition, analysts have described Jara as less dogmatic and more diplomatic than some of her Communist peers. As labor minister, she earned praise for a program that increased minimum wage and reduced the working week to 40 hours.",
      "She has earned comparisons to Michelle Bachelet, Chile's former center-left president and an icon of female empowerment who governed 2006 to 2010 and again from 2014 to 2018.",
      "Paying tribute to Bachelet in her victory speech, she said: \u201cShe was the one who showed us the path that nothing is impossible.\u201d",
      "But Jara faces a tough climb to the top job. Recent opinion polls show the left-wing government declining in popularity at a moment of sluggish economic growth and rising fears over organized crime and migration in what has long been regarded as one of the region\u2019s most stable and prosperous democracies.",
      "Those hot-button issues have helped mobilize support for Chile's right-wing candidates, particularly ultraconservative lawyer and former lawmaker Jose Antonio Kast, and set the stage for a deeply polarized election.",
      "Another favorite on the right is Evelyn Matthei, a former minister of labor whose business friendly policy proposals have charmed investors.",
      "Chileans will go to the polls Nov. 16 to elect a president for the 2026-2030 term.",

      "Williams, Louis Vuitton\u2019s showman-in-chief, turned his runway into a snakes-and-ladders fantasy with a guest list to match: Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, K-pop royalty J-Hope and Jackson Wang, reggaeton star Karol G, and Hollywood names like Bradley Cooper and Mason Thames. Each arrival triggered waves of posts and stories \u2014 making the crowd as newsworthy as the collection itself.",
      "The modern runway has become a stage for celebrity, where the applause is measured in views and viral moments, and the line between performer and spectator disappears.",
      "No other force is shifting menswear trends faster than K-pop. This season, stars like J-Hope, Jackson Wang, GOT7\u2019s Bambam, and NCT\u2019s Yuta were everywhere, livestreaming shows and igniting fashion frenzies from Seoul to Sao Paulo.",
      "These idols are both tastemakers and trend translators, instantly transmitting what they see in Paris to millions of fans. Their attendance has become a commercial event in itself, driving the adoption of new styles on a global scale.",

      "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d moment and Louis Vuitton\u2019s nod to Western style sent cowboy hats, flared denim, and rhinestone shirts trending worldwide. Brands scramble to turn these viral moments into wearable trends \u2014 knowing that what Queen Bey wears in Paris will be copied in malls and on apps within weeks.",
      "\u201cWe make fashion, but we\u2019re a house of travel,\u201d Williams told reporters. In truth, it\u2019s the celebrity\u2019s journey through fashion that matters most.",
      "The old fashion cycle is gone. It's been said before. Where trends once took months to trickle down, now a celebrity-worn look can reach the high street soon after the show lights dim.",
      "TikTok and fast fashion brands move at the speed of the repost. At Herm\u00e8s, even the discreet luxury of woven leather tees and wide trousers took on new meaning as athletes and music stars documented their attendance. Their posts quickly turn exclusive details into mass-market \u201cmust-haves.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a process that global platforms like Shein and Temu have weaponized \u2014 transforming a viral runway or celebrity moment into affordable, shoppable trends in a matter of days. The result: What debuts on the Paris catwalk can show up in online shopping carts from Atlanta to Addis Ababa almost instantly.",
      "Beneath the celebrity glow, classic trends endure. Streetwear is still king, with oversized silhouettes, soft tailoring and activewear influences everywhere from Dior to Dolce & Gabbana.",
      "The Herm\u00e8s \u201ccool city guy\u201d and Dolce\u2019s pajama dressing \u2014 rumpled but rich \u2014 are direct answers to how men want to live and move now. But even these trends go mainstream through star power, not just design. The models might debut the look, but it\u2019s the front-row faces who make it stick.",
      "Williams\u2019 very appointment as Louis Vuitton\u2019s menswear creative director \u2014 a chart-topping musician handpicked by LVMH chief Bernard Arnault in 2023 \u2014 was itself a statement: In today\u2019s industry, celebrity doesn\u2019t just influence fashion, it leads it.",
      "All this spectacle reflects a bigger shift. Fashion isn\u2019t just about what\u2019s in \u2014 it\u2019s about who\u2019s in the room, and who\u2019s watching. At Armani in Milan, at Saint Laurent in Paris, at every show, a galaxy of K-pop, Hollywood, and music stars now drive the narrative.",
      "For Gen Z and Alpha, the runway is no longer about aspiration \u2014 it\u2019s about participation, sharing, and living in the moment. The \u201cshow\u201d has become the product.",
      "In 2025, the biggest trend in men\u2019s fashion isn\u2019t a garment at all \u2014 it\u2019s the show itself. And in a season defined by heat, hype and headlines, it\u2019s clear: celebrity is the new couture, and we\u2019re all in the front row.",

      "IV therapy clinics are springing up around the country, touting quick ways to recover from a hangover or a hard workout. But doctors and regulators preach caution.",
      "The services have been on a growth spurt since the COVID-19 pandemic, offering drips that promise to boost energy, gird immune systems or relieve joint pain. This is done from bags of intravenous fluids normally seen hanging next to hospital beds.",
      "Customers must be willing to fork over as much as couple hundred dollars for each session \u2014 in some cases for a mixture of vitamins and supplements that would be considerably cheaper in pill form.",
      "Proponents say this approach helps customers hydrate faster and absorb more of a vitamin or supplement than they would by swallowing pills.",
      "But Dr. Sam Torbati, co-chair of emergency medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, says the therapy mostly helps people create \u201cexpensive urine,\u201d with the body clearing what it doesn't use.",
      "They\u2019re hard to count, partly because some businesses just provide IV therapy while others offer it as part of a medical spa.",
      "The practice grew popular during COVID-19, when access to doctors became limited and people grew more concerned about their immune system health, according to the American IV Association, an industry group.",
      "Regulators in Ohio are following the trend closely in their state, which now has around 200 clinics. These businesses were largely unheard of there before the pandemic, said Cameron McNamee, a spokesman for the Ohio Board of Pharmacy.",
      "Doctors say there are some good questions to pose before any treatment starts.",
      "Customers should ask the person starting the IV how long they have been doing their job and what sort of training they have, said Torbati.",
      "They also should know what\u2019s in the IV drip. For instance, \u201cWonder Juice\u201d treatment offered by the Restore Hyper Wellness franchise combines six vitamins and supplements that are available, in oral form, on the pharmacy store shelves.",
      "Knowing all the ingredients comes in handy if someone has an allergic reaction.",
      "Also ask where the company gets its drugs, if any are used. The answer should be a licensed pharmaceutical wholesaler, according to McNamee.",
      "Otherwise, the drug could be counterfeit or substandard. Ohio regulators have suspended the licenses of businesses that purchased drugs on Facebook.",
      "Customers also should make sure the clinic is in decent shape when they visit.",
      "\u201cIf the office isn\u2019t clean, then the IV room\u2019s probably not clean either,\u201d McNamee said.",
      "They don\u2019t like that a nurse or a paramedic often helps a customer decide on an IV therapy and then delivers the treatment. Rules can vary, but many state regulators say a doctor, physician assistant or nurse practitioner should be involved.",
      "The clinics often run on standing orders, which are issued by a doctor with the idea that they give the nurse or paramedic permission to treat patients according to certain protocols.",
      "Hospital emergency rooms regularly operate on the same kind of orders, according to Dr. Chris Seitz, an emergency physician and chairman of the American IV Association's scientific advisory board.",
      "\u201cMany nurses saw patients before I ever could get to them in the emergency department and initiated care like IV fluids,\u201d he said.",
      "Regulators also worry about the role customers play in picking their own treatments.",
      "\u201cA patient cannot enter a doctor\u2019s office or hospital and demand an IV any more than a patient can direct his or her own appendectomy,\u201d Kentucky officials said in a March statement.",
      "But Seitz says there should be a partnership between any care provider and the patient, with the provider helping the patient make the right decision.",
      "\u201cPatients have a requirement and a need to be the CEO of their own health,\u201d he said.",
      "Patient choice feeds another worry: the mixing of ingredients for specific treatments, a practice known as compounding.",
      "South Carolina regulators said in a 2023 statement that this should result from a valid care provider order, \u201cnot from a patient-driven menu akin to a fast-food restaurant.\u201d",
      "However, proponents say the addition of vitamins or drugs to an IV treatment should not be confused with mixing prescription drugs in a lab.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just pretty simple low-hanging fruit in terms of clinical complexity,\u201d said Jeff Cohen, a co-founder of the American IV Association.",
      "IV therapy clinics do provide some care. They can help cancer patients or pregnant women stay hydrated. Some treatments offer relief from migraine pain.",
      "But many drips require the creation of a sterile, soluble vitamin or supplement that is safe to put into someone's veins. That's more expensive to make than a vitamin that may cost a few cents a pill, Torbati noted.",
      "Customers will need to determine whether the added expense is worth it.",
      "\u201cUsually within eight hours, all that expensive therapy (is) peed out,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "A Republican plan heading to a vote in the Senate would quickly end incentives for clean energy and impose new taxes on some wind and solar projects, while boosting production of coal used to make steel",
      "WASHINGTON -- Clean energy advocates were already bracing for a Republican-led bill that would phase out tax credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy as President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under former President Joe Biden.",
      "But a proposal that emerged over the weekend was even more drastic than they thought.",
      "It was more aggressive in ending incentives for clean energy than a previous Senate version and would even impose new taxes on some wind and solar projects while boosting production of coal used in steelmaking. The Senate was moving Monday to approve Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts even as Democrats lined up to challenge it.",
      "The GOP plan is \u201ca death sentence for America\u2019s wind and solar industries\u201d that will lead to a spike in Americans\u2019 utility bills and jeopardize hundreds of renewable energy projects slated to boost the nation's electric grid, said Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "\u201cTheir plan started out as a phase-down of the tax credits I wrote for wind and solar\u201d in the 2022 climate law, Wyden said. \u201cBut now they\u2019re proposing an outright massacre with punishing new taxes on these industries that happen to be the cheapest and easiest ways to get new energy on the grid.\"",
      "Republicans said the tax-cut bill represents historic savings for taxpayers and supports production of traditional fossil-fuel energy sources such as oil, natural gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.",
      "\u201cTo achieve this record level of savings, we are slashing Biden\u2019s Green New Deal spending and promoting America-First energy,'' Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo, chairman of the Senate Finance panel and a lead architect of the bill, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe stop penalizing fossil fuels in favor of unreliable and expensive green energy, and instead support consistent energy sources, making energy affordable again.\u201d Crapo said.",
      "The Senate bill eliminates \u201chundreds of billions of dollars of the Green New Deal subsidies, including ending wasteful credits like the EV tax credit,\u201d he added, referring to a Democratic measure included the climate law to provide incentives for electric vehicles that don't emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.",
      "Some moderate senators, such as Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, were seeking to strip the new tax on wind and solar and make other other changes, but it was unclear whether those proposals would advance.",
      "If approved unchanged, the measure will kill investment in renewable energy and jeopardize hundreds of gigawatts of new power supply that would otherwise help the U.S. meet rapidly rising electricity demand as data centers, artificial intelligence and other growing uses strain the power grid, environmental advocates said.",
      "The GOP plan would \"lock in higher household energy bills, kill American jobs ... and torch our future,'' said Mattea Mrkusic, who leads energy policy for the environmental group Evergreen Action.",
      "The bill would cut off climate law credits for projects that aren\u2019t \u201cplaced in service\u201d \u2014 that is, plugged into the grid \u2014 by the end of 2028. That timeline is more aggressive than previous proposals and virtually impossible for most projects to meet, advocates said.",
      "The legislation also blocks credits for companies using components from adversaries such as China and adds a new tax on wind and solar projects that don\u2019t follow certain supply chain rules.",
      "Princeton University Professor Jesse D. Jenkins said he was surprised at the Senate bill's speed in ending wind and solar incentives and shocked at the proposed tax credit for metallurgical coal, a highly polluting form of coal that is used in steel-making and often exported to countries like India and Brazil.",
      "\u201cThis bill kills the industries of the future while subsidizing the industries of the 19th century. It\u2019s insanity!\u201d Jenkins said in a post on social media.",
      "If passed as proposed, the bill lead to higher energy prices, fewer jobs, less investment in American energy production and less confidence in the American business environment, Jenkins said.",
      "Tom Pyle, president of the conservative American Energy Alliance, called the Senate bill a move in the right direction.",
      "\u201cIf, as supporters of the Inflation Reduction Act are complaining, repealing these subsidies will \u2018kill\u2019 their industry, then maybe it shouldn\u2019t exist in the first place,\" Pyle said, referring to the 2022 climate law.",
      "\u201cExtending green giveaways on the backs of American taxpayers is shortsighted and neglectful,\" Pyle said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Congress to deliver both energy reliability and the largest tax cut in history to President Trump and the American people.\u201d",
      "Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, called the Senate bill a \u201cmidnight dumping\u201d and said it would punish the fastest-growing sectors of the U.S. energy industry.",
      "\u201cIt is astounding that the Senate would intentionally raise prices on consumers rather than encouraging economic growth and addressing the affordability crisis facing American households,\" Grumet said. The bill would \u201cstrand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments\u201d and land hardest on rural communities that would benefit the most from clean energy investment, he said.",
      "Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, called the bill \u201ca direct attack on American energy, American workers and American consumers.\"",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: If this bill passes, Americans will pay the price \u2014 literally,\" Hopper said. \"Power bills will rise. Factory jobs will vanish. Families will be forced to spend more just to keep the lights on and their homes cool. All while we become more dependent on foreign energy and more vulnerable to blackouts.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court has decided to review whether Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's lawsuit seeking to shut down part of an aging pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac belongs in state or federal court",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The U.S. Supreme Court announced Monday it will review whether Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's lawsuit seeking to shut down a section of an aging pipeline beneath a Great Lakes channel belongs in state court.",
      "Nessel sued in state court in June 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows the Enbridge energy company to operate a 4.5-mile (6.4-kilometer) section of pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac, which link Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.",
      "She won a restraining order shutting down the pipeline from Ingham County Judge James Jamo in June 2020, although Enbridge was allowed to continue operations after meeting safety requirements.",
      "The company moved the lawsuit into federal court in 2021, arguing it affects U.S. and Canadian trade. But a three-judge panel from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case back to Jamo in June 2024, finding that Enbridge missed a 30-day deadline to change jurisdictions.",
      "On Monday, the Supreme Court did not explain its rationale for taking up the matter.",
      "Enbridge officials said in a statement that they were encouraged by the Supreme Court's choice, noting that exceptions to the 30-day deadline exist.",
      "Nessel spokesperson Kimberly Bush said the lawsuit belongs in a Michigan court. The attorney general's lawyers have argued that the case invokes the public trust doctrine, a concept in state law holding that natural resources belong to the public.",
      "The pipeline at issue, Line 5, has moved crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Concerns over the section beneath the straits rupturing and causing a catastrophic spill have been growing since 2017, when Enbridge engineers revealed they had known about gaps in the section\u2019s protective coating since 2014. A boat anchor damaged the section in 2018, intensifying fears of a spill.",
      "The Michigan Department of Natural Resources under Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer revoked the straits easement for Line 5 in 2020. Enbridge has filed a separate federal lawsuit challenging the revocation.",
      "The company is seeking permits to encase the section of pipeline beneath the straits in a protective tunnel. The Michigan Public Service Commission granted the relevant permits in 2023, but Enbridge still needs approval from from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.",
      "The pipeline is at the center of a legal dispute in Wisconsin as well. A federal judge in Madison last summer gave Enbridge three years to shut down part of Line 5 that runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior\u2019s reservation. The company has proposed rerouting the pipeline around the reservation and has appealed the shutdown order to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",

      "The Senate will try to sprint ahead on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts after a weekend of setbacks",
      "WASHINGTON -- After a weekend of setbacks, the Senate will try to sprint ahead Monday on President Donald Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts despite a series of challenges, including the sudden announcement from one GOP senator that he won't run for reelection after opposing the package over its Medicaid health care cuts.",
      "An all-night session to consider an endless stream of proposed amendments to the package, in what's called a vote-a-rama, was abruptly postponed, and it's now scheduled to launch as soon as the Senate gavels open. With Democrats united against the Republican president's legislation and eagerly lined up to challenge it, the voting could take all day.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the \u201chardest choices\" for Republicans are still to come. His side plans to bring \u201camendment after amendment after amendment to the floor, so Republicans can defend their billionaire tax cuts and so they can try to explain their massive cuts to Medicaid to people back home.\u201d",
      "The hours ahead will be pivotal for the Republicans, who have control of the Congress and are racing against Trump's Fourth of July deadline to wrap up work. The 940-page \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d as it is now formally titled, has consumed the Congress as its shared priority with the president, with no room politically to fail, even as not all Republicans are on board.",
      "A new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law. It also said the package would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the decade.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson's leadership team has recalled lawmakers back to Washington for voting in the House as soon as Wednesday, if the legislation can first clear the Senate.",
      "But the outcome remains uncertain, especially after a weekend of work in the Senate that brought less visible progress on securing enough Republican support, over Democratic opposition, for passage.",
      "Few Republicans appear fully satisfied as the final package emerges. GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who announced Sunday he would not seek reelection after Trump badgered him over his opposition to the package, said he has the same goals as Trump, cutting taxes and spending.",
      "But Tillis said this package is a betrayal of the president's promises not to kick people off health care, especially if rural hospitals close.",
      "\u201cWe could take the time to get this right,\u201d he thundered.",
      "At the same time, some loosely aligned conservative Senate Republicans \u2014 Rick Scott of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming \u2014 have pushed for steeper cuts, particularly to health care, drawing their own warning from Trump.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t go too crazy!\u201d the president posted on social media. \u201cREMEMBER, you still have to get reelected.\u201d",
      "GOP leaders barely secured enough support to muscle the legislation past a procedural Saturday night hurdle in a tense scene. A handful of Republican holdouts revolted, and it took phone calls from Trump and a visit from Vice President JD Vance to keep it on track.",
      "As Saturday\u2019s vote tally teetered, attention turned to Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who was surrounded by GOP leaders in intense conversation. She voted \u201cyes.\u201d",
      "Several provisions in the package including a higher tax deduction for native whalers and potential waivers from food stamps or Medicaid changes are being called the \u201cPolar Payoff\u201d designed for her state. But some were found to be out of compliance with the rules by the Senate parliamentarian.",
      "All told, the Senate bill includes some $4 trillion in tax cuts, making permanent Trump's 2017 rates, which would expire at the end of the year if Congress fails to act, while adding the new ones he campaigned on, including no taxes on tips.",
      "The Senate package would roll back billions of dollars in green energy tax credits that Democrats warn will wipe out wind and solar investments nationwide and impose $1.2 trillion in cuts, largely to Medicaid and food stamps, by imposing work requirements, making sign-up eligibility more stringent and changing federal reimbursements to states.",
      "Additionally, the bill would provide a $350 billion infusion for border and national security, including for deportations, some of it paid for with new fees charged to immigrants.",
      "Unable to stop the march toward passage, the Democrats as the minority party in Congress are using the tools at their disposal to delay and drag out the process.",
      "Democrats forced a full reading of the text, which took 16 hours. Then Democratic senators took over Sunday's debate, filling the chamber with speeches, while Republicans largely stood aside.",
      "\u201cReckless and irresponsible,\" said Sen. Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan.",
      "\"A gift to the billionaire class,\u201d said Vermont's Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.",
      "\u201cFollow what the Bible teaches us: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,\u201d said Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., as Sunday's debate pushed past midnight.",

      "After nearly four months of military training, the young soldier and the rest of her unit spent early June completing their final exercises near the Danish army\u2019s barracks in Hovelte, 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "Katrine and other female soldiers, all of whom spoke to The Associated Press on June 11 on the condition that only their first names be used because of operational security, volunteered for military service earlier this year. Until now, that was the only way women were allowed to partake in military service, although women have been able to enlist as full-time members of the armed forces since the early 1970s",
      "The Scandinavian country is seeking to increase the number of young people in the military by extending compulsory enlistment to women for the first time. Men and women can both still volunteer, and the remaining places will be filled by a gender-neutral draft lottery.",

      "Under new rules passed by Denmark\u2019s parliament earlier in June, Danish women who turn 18 after Tuesday will be entered into the lottery system, on an equal footing with their male compatriots.

      "\u201cThat makes it very real,\u201d Katrine said.",
      "Denmark's gender-parity reforms were originally outlined in 2024 as part of a major defense agreement. The program was originally expected to be implemented by early 2027, but has been brought forward to summer 2025.",

Some people \u2014 both men and women \u2014 volunteer, and the rest of the places are filled by a lottery system that until now has only involved men. Women volunteers make up roughly a quarter of 2024\u2019s cohort.",
      "\u201cSome will probably be very disappointed being chosen to go into the military,\u201d Anne Sofie, part of Katrine\u2019s cohort of volunteers, said of the new female conscripts. \u201cSome will probably be surprised and like it a lot more than they think they would.\u201d",

      "In February, Denmark\u2019s government announced plans to bolster its military by setting up a $7 billion fund that it said would raise the country\u2019s defense spending to more than 3% of gross domestic product this year. Parts of the conscript program are being financed by the so-called Acceleration Fund.",
      "\u201cWe see a sharpened security situation in Europe. We have the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. We have focus on the Baltic countries, where Denmark is contributing a lot of soldiers. So, I think it\u2019s a general effort to strengthen the Danish defense,\u201d said researcher Rikke Haugegaard from the Royal Danish Defense College.",

      "It\u2019s been years since Hong Kong\u2019s mass arrests of activists devastated its pro-democracy activism",
      "HONG KONG -- It\u2019s been years since mass arrests all but silenced pro-democracy activism in Hong Kong. But a crackdown on dissent in the semiautonomous Chinese city is still expanding, hitting restaurants, bookstores and other small businesses.",
      "Shops and eateries owned by people once associated with the largely subdued pro-democracy movement are feeling a tightening grip through increased official inspections, anonymous complaint letters and other regulatory checks.",
      "Those critical of the city's political changes say it\u2019s a less visible side of a push to silence dissent that began five years ago when Beijing imposed a national security law to crush challenges to its rule, under which opposition politicians were jailed and pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily was shuttered.",
      "China said the law was necessary for the city's stability following anti-government protests in 2019.",
      "In 2024, the city passed its own national security law, which has been used to jail people for actions like writing pro-independence messages on the back of bus seats and wearing a T-shirt carrying a protest slogan that authorities deemed could imply the separation of Hong Kong from China, a red line for Beijing.",
      "In recent weeks, food authorities sent letters to restaurants warning that their business licenses could be revoked if the government deems them to be endangering national security or public interest.",
      "Leticia Wong, a former pro-democracy district councilor who now runs a bookstore, says her shop is frequently visited by food and hygiene inspectors, the fire department or other authorities over complaints about issues like hosting events without a license. It happens most often around June 4, the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.",
      "Her records show government authorities took measures against her shop some 92 times between July 2022 and June 2025, including inspecting her shop, conspicuously patrolling outside, or sending letters warning her of violations. She has been studying regulations to protect herself from accidentally breaking them.",
      "\"Some areas look trivial \u2014 and they really are \u2014 but they still have the power to make you face consequences,\" she said.",
      "In an emailed reply to The Associated Press, the fire department said it conducted checks at Wong\u2019s business following multiple complaints this year. Wong\u2019s bookstore passed most of them but still faces enforcement action for failing to provide valid certificates for two fire extinguishers and its emergency lighting system, it said.",
      "Other small business owners described similar experiences.",
      "A bakery that put up pro-democracy decorations during the 2019 protests saw food authorities\u2019 inspections jump from quarterly to monthly over the past one to two years, mostly over labeling complaints. Its owner, who asked to remain anonymous fearing government retribution, said the frequent inspections made running the business a struggle.",
      "A restaurant owner who received the notice of the newly added terms on possible license revocation over national security violations said he doesn\u2019t know what could be considered a violation and fears one wrong move could cost his staff their jobs. He spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing potential impact on his business partners and employees.",
      "Food authorities said inspections follow the law, information and public complaints. They maintained that the new national security conditions for food business licenses were clearly defined and would not affect law-abiding operators.",
      "The Hong Kong Chief Executive's office has not immediately commented.",
      "Others say they have lost opportunities after anonymous letters were sent to employers or business partners.",
      "Wong said an anonymous letter sent to an organization that had planned an event at her shop prompted them to cancel the booking. Separately, she lost a freelance job after a funder demanded that a social enterprise not hire her without a specific reason.",
      "Her landlord also received an anonymous letter warning them not to rent the space to her.",
      "\u201cI feel that this society is working very hard \u2014 that is, within the system, under the official system, working very hard to reject me, or to make my life difficult,\u201d Wong said.",
      "Chan Kim-kam, another former district councilor, says she lost both a part-time job and a role in a play after the people she worked for were pressured. A school where she taught sociology part-time asked her to leave after it received a letter claiming that she made a student uncomfortable.",
      "The letter, which was written in the simplified Chinese characters used in mainland China but less prominently in Hong Kong, included links to news reports about her arrest under the homegrown national security law last year, though she was never charged.",
      "Meanwhile, the city\u2019s Leisure and Cultural Services Department told her drama group to replace her or lose their venue, she said.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really such a pity. When the culture of reporting people has become so intense, it destroys the trust between people,\u201d she said.",
      "Cultural authorities, declining to discuss specific bookings, said all their venue bookings were managed under established procedures.",
      "Hong Kong leader John Lee has said the security law upholds the rule of law principle and only an extremely small portion of people were targeted. He noted 332 people have been arrested for offenses related to national security, about 66 each year on average, or 0.2% of the police\u2019s annual arrest figures. Still, he warned of persisting soft resistance, saying \u201cthe streets are full of petty people.\u201d",
      "Local broadcaster i-Cable News said national security guidelines would be issued to government workers. Secretary for Security Chris Tang told the broadcaster that even a cleaner should report words endangering national security, if any are found during their job.",
      "But Eric Lai, a research fellow at Georgetown Center for Asian Law, said Hong Kong is using regulatory powers to monitor and regulate dissent without checks and balances. Local courts were unable to check the powers granted to the government under the security laws, he said.",
      "It fits a common pattern among undemocratic governments like mainland China, he said. In many cases across the border, law enforcement officers frequently harass and surveil dissenters without formal charges.",
      "\u201cIt tells the world that the so-called rule of law in Hong Kong is only a facade of rule by men,\u201d he said.",
      "Outside a court on Jun. 12, members of the pro-democracy party League of Social Democrats protested against their convictions over street booth activities with a banner that says \u201crule of law in name, silencing voices in reality.\u201d",
      "They were fined for collecting money without a permit and displaying posters without approval. The judge said freedom of expression was not absolute and restrictions could be imposed to maintain public order.",
      "On Sunday, the party announced it had dissolved, citing immense political pressure and consideration of consequences for its members, months after the city\u2019s biggest pro-democracy party announced to move toward disbandment. Its chairperson Chan Po-ying wiped away tears at the news conference.",
      "\u201cIn the past, the government said it focused on a small portion of people. Now, it includes various kinds of people in Hong Kong, ordinary residents,\u201d she said.",

      "BEIJING -- China has reopened its market to seafood from Japan after a nearly two-year ban over the discharge of slightly radioactive wastewater from the tsunami-destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant.",
      "A notice from the customs agency said the ban had been lifted Sunday and that imports from much of Japan would be resumed.",
      "The ban, imposed in August 2023, was a major blow to Japan's scallop and sea cucumber exporters. China was the biggest overseas market for Japanese seafood, accounting for more than one-fifth of its exports. The decision to lift the ban coincides with efforts by China and Japan to improve ties as both face economic uncertainty because of the American tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The nuclear plant at Fukushima was heavily damaged by a deadly tsunami that followed a huge offshore earthquake in 2011. Water still must be pumped in to cool the radioactive fuel. The water is then stored in what was an ever-growing complex of tanks on the property.",
      "After years of debate, the utility won Japanese government permission to discharge the water gradually into the sea after treating it to remove most of the radioactive elements and diluting it with seawater. Japanese officials said the wastewater would be safer than international standards and have negligible environmental impact.",
      "China disagreed and imposed a ban, saying the discharge would endanger the fishing industry and coastal communities on its east coast.",
      "Over months of talks, Japan agreed to let China take samples of the water for testing. The sampling has not found any abnormalities, the customs agency notice said",
      "China still opposes the wastewater discharge, but based on scientific evidence and analysis, it is allowing imports on a conditional basis from parts of Japan that meet China's standards, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.",
      "A ban remains in place for seafood from 10 of Japan's 47 prefectures, including Fukushima and nearby ones.",
      "Japanese seafood exporters will have to reapply for registration in China and all imports will have to include a health certificate, a certificate of compliance for radioactive substance testing and a certificate of origin, the Chinese customs agency said.",
      "Shipments to China are expected to resume gradually, Japanese government spokesperson Kazuhiko Aoki told reporters in Tokyo on Monday, noting the re-registration requirement.",
      "He said it was unclear how quickly scallop and sea cucumber exporters would return to China, because they had sought out other markets since the ban. But he predicted sales of sea cucumbers, a prized delicacy in China, would recover to a certain degree.",
      "Aoki said the Japanese government would continue to press for the lifting of the export ban on the other 10 prefectures.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The changes made to President Donald Trump's big tax bill in the Senate would pile trillions onto the nation's debt load while resulting in even steeper losses in health care coverage, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a new analysis, adding to the challenges for Republicans as they try to muscle the bill to passage.",
      "The CBO estimates the Senate bill would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034, a nearly $1 trillion increase over the House-passed bill, which CBO has projected would add $2.4 to the debt over a decade.",
      "The analysis also found that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law, an increase over the scoring for the House-passed version of the bill, which predicts 10.9 million more people would be without health coverage.",
      "The stark numbers are yet another obstacle for Republican leaders as they labor to pass Trump's bill by his self-imposed July 4th deadline.",
      "Even before the CBO's estimate, Republicans were at odds over the contours of the legislation, with some resisting the cost-saving proposals to reduce spending on Medicaid and food aid programs even as other Republicans say those proposals don't go far enough. Republicans are slashing the programs as a way to help cover the cost of extending some $3.8 trillion in Trump tax breaks put in place during his first term.",
      "The push-pull was on vivid display Saturday night as a routine procedural vote to take up the legislation in the Senate was held open for hours as Vice President JD Vance and Republican leaders met with several holdouts. The bill ultimately advanced in a 51-49 vote, but the path ahead is fraught, with voting on amendments still to come.",
      "Still, many Republicans are disputing the CBO estimates and the reliability of the office's work. To hoist the bill to passage, they are using a different budget baseline that assumes the Trump tax cuts expiring in December have already been extended, essentially making them cost-free in the budget.",
      "The CBO on Saturday released a separate analysis of the GOP's preferred approach that found the Senate bill would reduce deficits by about $500 billion.",
      "Democrats and economists decry the GOP's approach as \u201cmagic math\u201d that obscures the true costs of the GOP tax breaks.",
      "In addition, Democrats note that under the traditional scoring system, the Republican bill bill would violate the Senate's \u201cByrd Rule\u201d that forbids the legislation from increasing deficits after 10 years.",
      "In a Sunday letter to Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, CBO Director Phillip Swagel said the office estimates that the Finance Committee\u2019s portion of the bill, also known as Title VII, \u201cincreases the deficits in years after 2034\u201d under traditional scoring.",

      "It's a time frame Trump often cites, most recently about a decision on whether the U.S. military would get directly involved in the war between Israel and Iran. The U.S. struck Iranian nuclear sites just days later.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order to keep TikTok running in the U.S. for 90 more days to give his administration more time to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership.",
      "It is the third time Trump extended the deadline. The first one was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when a national ban \u2014 approved by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court \u2014 took effect.",
      "U.S. strikes on Iran \u201cobliterated\u201d its nuclear facilities, Trump insisted, and he said whoever leaked a preliminary intelligence assessment suggesting Tehran's nuclear program had been set back only a few months should be prosecuted.",
      "Trump said Iran was \u201cweeks away\u201d from achieving a nuclear weapon before he ordered the strikes.",
      "\u201cIt was obliterated like nobody\u2019s ever seen before,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd that meant the end to their nuclear ambitions, at least for a period of time.\u201d",
      "Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Sunday on X that Trump \"exaggerated to cover up and conceal the truth.\" Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, told CBS' \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that his country's nuclear program is peaceful and that uranium \u201cenrichment is our right, and an inalienable right and we want to implement this right\u201d under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \u201cI think that enrichment will not \u2014 never stop.\u201d",
      "Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said on CBS that \u201cit is clear that there has been severe damage, but it\u2019s not total damage.\"",
      "Grossi also said the U.N. nuclear watchdog has faced pressure to report that Iran had a nuclear weapon or was close to one, but \u201cwe simply didn\u2019t because this was not what we were seeing.\u201d",
      "Of the leak of the intelligence assessment, Trump said anyone found to be responsible should be prosecuted. Journalists who received it should be asked who their source was, he said: \u201cYou have to do that and I suspect we\u2019ll be doing things like that.\u201d",
      "His press secretary said Thursday that the administration is investigating the matter.",
      "As he played up his immigration crackdown, Trump offered a more nuanced view when it comes to farm and hotel workers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the strongest immigration guy that there\u2019s ever been, but I\u2019m also the strongest farmer guy that there\u2019s ever been,\u201d the Republican president said.",
      "He noted that he wants to deport criminals, but it\u2019s a problem when farmers lose their laborers and it destroys their businesses.",
      "Trump said his administration is working on \u201csome kind of a temporary pass\u201d that could give farmers and hotel owners control over immigration raids at their facilities.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump had called for a pause on immigration raids disrupting the farming, hotel and restaurant industries, but a top Homeland Security official followed up with a seemingly contradictory statement. Tricia McLaughlin said there would be \u201cno safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine\u201d immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "Trump praised a recent trade deal with Beijing over rare earth exports from China and said establishing a fairer relationship will require significant tariffs.",
      "\u201cI think getting along well with China is a very good thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cChina\u2019s going to be paying a lot of tariffs, but we have a big (trade) deficit, they understand that.\"",
      "Trump said he would be open to removing sanctions on Iranian oil shipments to China if Iran can show \u201cthey can be peaceful and if they can show us they're not going to do any more harm.\u201d",
      "But the president also indicated the U.S. isn\u2019t afraid to retaliate against Beijing. When Fox News Channel host Maria Bartiromo noted that China has tried to hack U.S. systems and steal intellectual property, Trump replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t think we do that to them?\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Apple has its first box-office hit.",
      "\u201cF1 The Movie\u201d debuted with $55.6 million in North American theaters and $144 million globally over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday, handing the tech company easily its biggest opening yet.",
      "Though Apple Original Films has had some notable successes in its six years in Hollywood \u2014 including the 2021 Oscar-winner \u201cCODA\u201d \u2014 its theatrical results have been decidedly mixed. Misfires like \u201cArgylle\u201d and \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d and big-budget awards plays like Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cNapoleon\u201d and Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d have been better at driving viewers to Apple TV+ than movie theaters.",
      "But \u201cF1\u201d was Apple\u2019s first foray into summer blockbuster territory. It won a bidding war for the project from much of the production team behind the 2022 box-office smash \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d Apple then partnered with Warner Bros. to distributed the film starring Brad Pitt, Damson Idris and Kerry Condon.",
      "With a production budget over $200 million, \u201cF1\u201d still has several laps to go to turn a profit. But for now, \u201cF1\u201d is full speed ahead.",
      "\"The film\u2019s outstanding debut reflects both the excitement of Formula 1 and the deeply emotional and entertaining story crafted by the entire cast and creative team,\" said Zack Van Amburg, who heads worldwide video for Apple with Jamie Erlicht. \"Their dedication and innovation have fueled an unforgettable cinematic experience.\u201d",
      "Car racing movies have often struggled in theaters; crash-and-burn cases include Ron Howard\u2019s \u201cRush\u201d (2013) and Michael Mann\u2019s \u201cFerrari\u201d (2023). But \u201cF1\u201d built off the Formula 1 fandom stirred up by the popular series \u201cFormula 1: Drive to Survive.\u201d And it leaned on \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d director Joseph Kosinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer to deliver another adult-oriented action thrill ride.",
      "As in \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d the filmmakers sought an adrenaline rush by placing IMAX cameras inside the cockpit in \u201cF1.\u201d IMAX and large-format screens accounted for 55% of in its ticket sales. IMAX, whose screens are much sought-after in the summer, has carved out a three-week run for the movie.",
      "Warner Bros. expected \u201cF1\u201d to perform well overseas, where the sport is more popular than it is in the U.S. Jeffrey Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros., said Pitt was the movie's \u201csecret sauce.\u201d The $144 million global launch is the actor's biggest opening weekend.",
      "\u201cWe came up with multiple campaigns based on where you are in the world,\u201d said Goldstein. \u201cWe planned for an audience-winner: screen the movie and get it out there. People talking about this movie drove this movie.\u201d",
      "Reviews have been very good for \u201cF1\u201d and audience reaction (an \u201cA\u201d via CinemaScore) was even better. That suggests \u201cF1\u201d could hold up well in the coming weeks despite some formidable coming competition in Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cJurassic World Rebirth.\u201d",
      "Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore, praised Warner Bros. for making \u201cF1\u201d a theatrical event. The studio was also behind the year's other big original release, \u201cSinners.\"",
      "\u201cFor Apple, this demonstrates to them the prestige factor of having a big theatrical release,\" said Dergarabedian. \u201cIt elevates their brand.\"",
      "Universal\u2019s \u201cM3gan 2.0\u201d had been expected to pose a greater challenge to \u201cF1.\u201d Instead, the robot doll sequel didn\u2019t come close to matching the 2022 original\u2019s box-office launch.",
      "\u201cM3gan 2.0\u201d collected $10.2 million in 3,112 theaters. Memes and viral videos helped propel the first \u201cM3gan\u201d to a $30.4 million opening and a total haul of $180 million, all on a $12 million budget.",
      "Still, the Blumhouse Productions horror thriller could wind up profitable. The film, written and directed by Gerald Johnstone, cost a modest $25 million to make. A spinoff titled \u201cSoulm8te\u201d is scheduled for release next year.",
      "M3gan 2.0\u201d ended up in fourth place. The box-office leader of the last two weekends, \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon,\u201d slid to second with $19.4 million. The DreamWorks Animation live-action hit from Universal Pictures has surpassed $200 million domestically in three weeks.",
      "After a debut that marked a new low for Pixar, the studio\u2019s \u201cElio\u201d gathered up $10.7 million in sales in its second weekend. That gives the Walt Disney Co. release a disappointing two-week start of $42.2 million.",
      "With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",

      "The power of celebrity is the one trend that defined the fashion season in Paris",
      "PARIS -- If any force dominated the global fashion industry this season \u2014 eclipsing fabric, form and even the wildest silhouettes \u2014 it was the spectacle of celebrity.",
      "In a year marked by global anxiety and a hunger for fantasy, star power flooded Paris Fashion Week, turning runways into gladiator arenas where A-list icons, K-pop idols and digital megastars became the main event.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z didn\u2019t just attend Louis Vuitton\u2019s blockbuster show \u2014 they became the show.",
      "As they swept into the Pompidou Center, cameras flashed and phones shot skyward. Before the first look even hit the runway, images of the couple ricocheted across the globe. K-pop idols like J-Hope and Jackson Wang livestreamed their arrival to millions, while crowds outside flooded social feeds with every glimpse of a star.",
      "As the industry\u2019s spring season wraps up Sunday, it\u2019s clear: Fashion\u2019s global audience is focused less on what\u2019s worn and more on who\u2019s wearing it.",
      "This interplay between celebrity and fashion is hardly new, but in 2025, the desire for escapism and star-driven spectacle is peaking like never before.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about celebrity clickbait, and it\u2019s at a tipping point now. Celebrities have replaced the designers and stylists as the tastemakers,\u201d said Anna Barr, a fashion magazine editor who attended shows.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's appearance this week encapsulated a truth that every major brand \u2014 from Louis Vuitton to Dior, Herm\u00e8s to Saint Laurent \u2014 now understands: The real front row isn\u2019t in Paris, but on Instagram, TikTok and Weibo. And nothing sells quite like a star.",
      "The pop star\u2019s head-to-toe denim \u2014 custom Louis Vuitton by Pharrell Williams \u2014 wasn\u2019t just viral.",
      "Within 24 hours, clips of her arrival amassed millions of views on TikTok, outpacing even Louis Vuitton\u2019s own campaign content. When Williams presented her with a Speedy bag straight from the runway in the Paris dusk, the moment went viral \u2014 underlining that Beyonc\u00e9 isn\u2019t just an attendee, but a face of Louis Vuitton\u2019s creative vision.",
      "But even as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s look became the week\u2019s most shared image, her presence in Paris also sparked debate: a Buffalo Soldiers T-shirt she wore during her \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d tour ignited criticism from some Indigenous and Mexican communities, reminding the industry that every viral moment can be a flash point.",
      "This is the new dynamic of luxury: The most coveted runway seat is now in your hand, and what matters most isn't just what you see, but who you see wearing it.",
      "What once was a private preview for buyers and editors is now a worldwide entertainment event.",
      "Designers don\u2019t just stage shows \u2014 they produce spectacles. Williams, Louis Vuitton\u2019s showman-in-chief, turned his runway into a snakes-and-ladders fantasy with a guest list to match: Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, K-pop royalty J-Hope and Jackson Wang, reggaeton star Karol G, and Hollywood names like Bradley Cooper and Mason Thames.",
      "Each arrival triggered waves of posts and stories \u2014 making the crowd as newsworthy as the collection itself.",
      "The modern runway has become a stage for celebrity, where the applause is measured in views and viral moments, and the line between performer and spectator disappears.",
      "No other force is shifting menswear trends faster than K-pop. This season, stars like J-Hope, Jackson Wang, GOT7\u2019s Bambam, and NCT\u2019s Yuta were everywhere, livestreaming shows and igniting fashion frenzies from Seoul to Sao Paulo.",
      "These idols are both tastemakers and trend translators, instantly transmitting what they see in Paris to millions of fans. Their attendance has become a commercial event in itself, driving the adoption of new styles on a global scale.",
      "Even the clothes themselves now chase celebrity.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201c Cowboy Carter \u201d moment and Louis Vuitton\u2019s nod to Western style sent cowboy hats, flared denim, and rhinestone shirts trending worldwide. Brands scramble to turn these viral moments into wearable trends \u2014 knowing that what Queen Bey wears in Paris will be copied in malls and on apps within weeks.",
      "\u201cWe make fashion, but we\u2019re a house of travel,\u201d Williams told reporters. In truth, it\u2019s the celebrity\u2019s journey through fashion that matters most.",
      "The old fashion cycle is gone. It's been said before. Where trends once took months to trickle down, now a celebrity-worn look can reach the high street soon after the show lights dim.",
      "TikTok and fast fashion brands move at the speed of the repost. At Herm\u00e8s, even the discreet luxury of woven leather tees and wide trousers took on new meaning as athletes and music stars documented their attendance. Their posts quickly turn exclusive details into mass-market \u201cmust-haves.\u201d",
      "Shein and Temu, the global fast-fashion juggernauts, have weaponized the viral moment \u2014 turning celebrity sightings into shoppable trends worldwide, sometimes in a matter of hours. The result: What debuts on the Paris catwalk can show up in online shopping carts from Atlanta to Addis Ababa almost instantly.",
      "Beneath the celebrity glow, classic trends endure. Streetwear is still king, with oversized silhouettes, soft tailoring and activewear influences everywhere from Dior to Dolce & Gabbana.",
      "The Herm\u00e8s \u201ccool city guy\u201d and Dolce\u2019s pajama dressing \u2014 rumpled but rich \u2014 are direct answers to how men want to live and move now. But even these trends go mainstream through star power, not just design. The models might debut the look, but it\u2019s the front-row faces who make it stick.",
      "The celebrity ascendancy isn\u2019t just a front-row phenomenon \u2014 it\u2019s woven into the industry itself. When LVMH \u2019s Bernard Arnault tapped Williams, a global pop icon, to lead Louis Vuitton menswear in 2023, it wasn\u2019t just a creative risk. It was a declaration that celebrity now runs the show.",
      "All this spectacle reflects a bigger shift. Fashion isn\u2019t just about what\u2019s in \u2014 it\u2019s about who\u2019s in the room, and who\u2019s watching. At Armani in Milan, at Saint Laurent in Paris, at every show, a galaxy of K-pop, Hollywood, and music stars now drive the narrative.",
      "For Gen Z and Alpha, the runway is no longer about aspiration \u2014 it\u2019s about participation, sharing, and living in the moment. The \u201cshow\u201d has become the product.",
      "In 2025, the hottest look in men\u2019s fashion isn\u2019t a garment \u2014 it\u2019s the spectacle. In the world\u2019s most-watched runway season, celebrity is the new couture, and every scroll puts you in the front row.",

      "NEW YORK -- Famed investor Warren Buffett is donating $6 billion worth of his company's stock to five foundations, bringing the total he has given to them since 2006 to roughly $60 billion, based on their value when received.",
      "Buffett said late Friday that the shares of Berkshire Hathaway will be delivered on Monday. Berkshire Hathaway owns Geico, Dairy Queen and a range of other businesses, and Buffett is donating nearly 12.4 million of the Class B shares of its stock. Those shares have a lower and easier-to-digest price tag than the company's original Class A shares, and each of the B shares was worth $485.68 at their most recent close on Friday.",
      "The largest tranche is going to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, which will receive 9.4 million shares. The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation will receive 943,384 shares, and the Sherwood Foundation, Howard G. Buffett Foundation and NoVo Foundation will each receive 660,366 shares.",

      "WASHINGTON -- At some 940-pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. Now it's up to Congress to decide whether President Donald Trump's signature's domestic policy package will become law.",
      "Trump told Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.",
      "Senators were working through the weekend to pass the bill and send it back to the House for a final vote. Democrats are united against it.",
      "Here's the latest on what's in the bill. There could be changes as lawmakers negotiate.",
      "Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay or some automotive loans, along with a bigger $6,000 deduction in the Senate draft for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.",
      "It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 under the Senate proposal. Families at lower income levels would not see the full amount.",
      "A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.",
      "There are scores of business-related tax cuts.",
      "The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.",
      "Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.",
      "The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.",
      "The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. The attorney general would have $3.5 billion for a similar fund, known as Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide, or BIDEN, referring to former Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "To help pay for it all, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.",
      "For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.",
      "To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back some long-running government programs: Medicaid, food stamps, green energy incentives and others. It's essentially unraveling the accomplishments of the past two Democratic presidents, Biden and Barack Obama.",
      "Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.",
      "The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program\u2019s work requirements.",
      "There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.",
      "Some 80 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.",
      "All told, the CBO estimates that under the House-passed bill, at least 10.9 million more people would go without health coverage and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.",
      "The Senate proposes a $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Fund to help offset reduced Medicaid dollars. It's a new addition, intended to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that the proposed Medicaid provider tax cuts would hurt rural hospitals.",
      "Both the House and Senate bills propose a dramatic rollback of the Biden-era green energy tax breaks for electric vehicles. They also would phase out or terminate the various production and investment tax credits companies use to stand up wind, solar and other renewable energy projects.",
      "In total, cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs would be expected to produce at least $1.5 trillion in savings.",
      "A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.",
      "The House and Senate both have a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump\u2019s long-sought \u201cNational Garden of American Heroes.\u201d",
      "There's a new excise tax on university endowments, restrictions on the development of artificial intelligence and blocks on transgender surgeries. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.",
      "Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for exploration to Mars.",
      "The bill would deter states from regulating artificial intelligence by linking certain federal AI infrastructure money to maintaining a freeze. Seventeen Republican governors asked GOP leaders to drop the provision.",
      "Also, the interior secretary would be directed to sell certain Bureau of Land Management acreage to provide for housing. The sale of public lands would cover at least 600,000 acres and up to 1.2 million acres, according to a projection from the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group.",
      "Altogether, keeping the existing tax breaks and adding the new ones is expected to cost $3.8 trillion over the decade, the CBO says in its analysis of the House bill. An analysis of the Senate draft is pending.",
      "The CBO estimates the House-passed package would add $2.4 trillion to the nation's deficits over the decade.",
      "Or not, depending on how one does the math.",
      "Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already \u201ccurrent policy.\u201d Senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.",
      "Under the Senate GOP view, the tax provisions cost $441 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "Democrats and others say this is \u201cmagic math\u201d that obscures the true costs of the GOP tax breaks. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget puts the Senate tally at $4.2 trillion over the decade.",

      "The Senate is expected to grind through a rare weekend session as Republicans race to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s package of tax breaks and spending cuts by his July Fourth deadline",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is expected to grind through a rare weekend session as Republicans race to pass President Donald Trump's package of tax breaks and spending cuts by his July Fourth deadline.",
      "Republicans are using their majorities in Congress to push aside Democratic opposition, but they have run into a series of political and policy setbacks. Not all GOP lawmakers are on board with proposals to reduce spending on Medicaid, food stamps and other programs as a way to help cover the cost of extending some $3.8 trillion in Trump tax breaks.",
      "The 940-page bill was released shortly before midnight Friday. Senators were expected to take a procedural vote Saturday to begin debate on the legislation, but the timing was uncertain and there is a long path ahead, with at least 10 hours of debate time and an all-night voting session on countless amendments.",
      "Senate passage could be days away, and the bill would need to return to the House for a final round of votes before it could reach the White House.",
      "\u201cIt's evolving,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., as he prepared to close up the chamber late Friday.",
      "The weekend session could be a make-or-break moment for Trump's party, which has invested much of its political capital on his signature domestic policy plan. Trump is pushing Congress to wrap it up, even as he sometimes gives mixed signals, allowing for more time.",
      "At recent events at the White House, including Friday, Trump has admonished the \u201cgrandstanders\u201d among GOP holdouts to fall in line.",
      "\u201cWe can get it done,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cIt will be a wonderful Celebration for our Country.\u201d",
      "The legislation is an ambitious but complicated series of GOP priorities. At its core, it would make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump's first term that would otherwise expire by year's end if Congress fails to act, resulting in a potential tax increase on Americans. The bill would add new breaks, including no taxes on tips, and commit $350 billion to national security, including for Trump's mass deportation agenda.",
      "But the spending cuts that Republicans are relying on to offset the lost tax revenues are causing dissent within the GOP ranks. Some lawmakers say the cuts go too far, particularly for people receiving health care through Medicaid. Meanwhile, conservatives, worried about the nation's debt, are pushing for steeper cuts.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he is concerned about the fundamentals of the package and will not support the procedural motion to begin debate.",
      "\u201cI'm voting no on the motion to proceed,\u201d he said.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., pushing for deeper cuts, said he needed to see the final legislative text.",
      "The release of that draft had been delayed as the Senate parliamentarian reviewed the bill to ensure it complied with the chamber\u2019s strict \u201cByrd Rule,\u201d named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. It largely bars policy matters from inclusion in budget bills unless a provision can get 60 votes to overcome objections. That would be a tall order in a Senate with a 53-47 GOP edge and Democrats unified against Trump\u2019s bill.",
      "Republicans suffered a series of setbacks after several proposals were determined to be out of compliance by the chief arbiter of the Senate's rules. One plan would have shifted some food stamp costs from the federal government to the states; a second would have gutted the funding structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "But over the past days, Republicans have quickly revised those proposals and reinstated them.",
      "The final text includes a proposal for cuts to a Medicaid provider tax that had run into parliamentary objections and opposition from several senators worried about the fate of rural hospitals. The new version extends the start date for those cuts and establishes a $25 billion fund to aid rural hospitals and providers.",
      "Most states impose the provider tax as a way to boost federal Medicaid reimbursements. Some Republicans argue that is a scam and should be abolished.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that under the House-passed version of the bill, some 10.9 million more people would go without health care and at least 3 million fewer would qualify for food aid. The CBO has not yet publicly assessed the Senate draft, which proposes steeper reductions.",
      "Top income-earners would see about a $12,000 tax cut under the House bill, while the poorest Americans would face a $1,600 tax increase, the CBO said.",
      "One unresolved issue remains the so-called SALT provision, a deduction for state and local taxes that has been a top priority of lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states. The cap is now $10,000.",
      "The White House and House Republicans had narrowed in on a plan for a $40,000 cap, but for five years instead of 10. Republican senators says that's too generous. At least one House GOP holdout, Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, said he cannot support the compromise.",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Republicans are rushing to finish the bill before the public fully knows what\u2019s in it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no good reason for Republicans to chase a silly deadline,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who sent his colleagues home for the weekend with plans to be on call to return to Washington, said they are \u201cvery close\u201d to finishing up.",
      "\u201cWe would still like to meet that July Fourth, self-imposed deadline,\u201d said Johnson, R-La.",
      "With the narrow Republicans majorities in the House and Senate, leaders need almost every lawmaker on board to ensure passage. Johnson and Thune have stayed close to the White House, relying on Trump to pressure holdout lawmakers.",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Carlos Alcaraz, locked in a five-set struggle at Centre Court, looked toward his coach Monday and shouted something about how Fabio Fognini \u2014 38, retiring after this season, winless in 2025 \u2014 looked as if he could keep playing until he\u2019s 50.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s his last Wimbledon,\u201d Alcaraz said later, \u201cbecause the level he has shown, he can still play three or four more years. Unbelievable.\u201d",
      "The two-time defending champion at the All England Club needed to go through more than 4 1/2 hours of back-and-forth shifts against the much-older and much-less-accomplished Fognini before emerging with a 7-5, 6-7 (5), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 victory in the first round.",
      "It wasn't supposed to be that tough.",
      "Consider, to begin with, that the No. 2-seeded Alcaraz is 22, already a five-time Grand Slam champion, including his latest at the French Open three weeks ago, and is currently on a career-best 19-match winning streak.",
      "Consider, too, that Fognini has never been past the third round at the All England Club in 15 appearances and reached the quarterfinals at any major tournament just once \u2014 way back at the 2011 French Open. He entered Monday ranked 138th and 0-6 this year.",
      "Oh, and then there\u2019s this: Only twice has the reigning men\u2019s champion at Wimbledon been beaten in the first round the following year, Lleyton Hewitt in 2003 and Manuel Santana in 1967.",
      "There were times Monday when Alcaraz appeared to be something less than his best, far from the form he displayed during his epic five-set, 5 1/2-hour comeback victory over No. 1 Jannik Sinner for the championship at Roland-Garros.",
      "Alcaraz double-faulted nine times. He faced a hard-to-believe 21 break points. He made more unforced errors, 62, than winners, 52.",
      "He chalked some of that up to nerves.",
      "\u201cPlaying the first match at Centre Court, and the first match of every tournament, is never easy,\u201d said Alcaraz, who beat Novak Djokovic in the 2023 and 2024 finals at that arena. \u201cI've been practicing pretty well. I've been playing on grass really well. But Wimbledon is special. It's different.\u201d",
      "Next for Alcaraz will be a match Wednesday against Oliver Tarvet, a 21-year-old British qualifier who plays college tennis at the University of San Diego and is ranked 733rd.",
      "Still, Alcaraz said: \u201cI have to improve in the next round.\u201d",
      "Fognini \u2014 whose wife, 2015 U.S. Open champion Flavia Pennetta, held one of their children in the stands \u2014 is a self-described hot-head and is known for mid-match flareups, including at Wimbledon, where he was fined $3,000 in 2019 for saying during a match that he wished \u201ca bomb would explode at the club\u201d and a then-record $27,500 in 2014 for a series of outbursts. He was put on a two-year probation by the Grand Slam Board in 2017 after insulting a female chair umpire at the U.S. Open and getting kicked out of that tournament.",
      "Such behavior wasn't displayed Monday. And when Alcaraz pushed a forehand long to cede the fourth set, Fognini nodded toward his guest box, where a member of his entourage stood to snap a photo with a cellphone. Things were picture-perfect for Fognini at that moment.",
      "But at the outset of the fifth \u2014 the first time the previous year\u2019s male champ was pushed that far in the first round since Roger Federer in 2010 \u2014 Alcaraz recalibrated.",
      "When the Spaniard broke to lead 2-0 in that set with a backhand volley winner, he pointed toward the stands, threw an uppercut and screamed, \u201cVamos!\u201d In the next game, he saved a pair of break points, before the match was paused for more than 10 minutes because a spectator felt ill amid record-breaking high temperatures for Day 1 of Wimbledon.",
      "When they resumed, Alcaraz outplayed Fognini the rest of the way.",
      "While Alcaraz escaped, at least five seeded men exited on Day 1, including No. 8 Holger Rune, No. 9 Daniil Medvedev \u2014 who also lost in the first round at the French Open \u2014 No. 16 Francisco Cerundolo, No. 20 Alexei Popyrin and No. 24 Stefanos Tsitsipas, who quit because of a persistent lower-back problem after dropping the first two sets. No. 20 Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 French Open champ, lost, while women\u2019s winners included No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, 2023 Wimbledon winner Marketa Vondrousova and 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu.",
      "No. 2 Coco Gauff, coming off her second major title, plays in Day 2's last match at Centre Court against Dayana Yastremska. The other matches in the main arena, starting at 1:30 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. ET), are defending champion Barbora Krejcikova against Alexandra Eala, followed by 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic against Alexandre Muller.

      "The 24-year-old Williams is expected to be ready for next season, Presti said. Williams was inactive for the final two games of the regular season after playing 36 minutes in a 125-112 victory over Phoenix on April 9.",
      "Williams wrote a brace on the wrist on his shooting hand at times during the playoffs and had it taped during games. He shot just 30% from 3-point range in the playoffs, more than 6% off his percentage during the regular season.",

He powered through. He showed incredible mental endurance and security in himself.\u201d",
      "A first-time All-Star in his third season after the Thunder drafted him 12th overall out of Santa Clara in 2022, Williams averaged career bests of 21.6 points, 5.3 rebounds and 5.1 assists.",

      "What happens next is going to have to wait.",
      "The future of NASCAR in Chicago is murky going into its third edition on the first weekend in July. The three-year contract between the motorsports organization and the city that was announced in 2022 has two mutual options, and their fate is unclear.",

      "It is geared as much to a new audience in one of NASCAR\u2019s most important regions as it is to the most ardent racing fans. NASCAR used to race at Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet, a 45-mile drive from downtown, but it pulled out after the 2019 season.",
      "\u201cThis is a top-three market for us, worldwide frankly, for NASCAR fans,\u201d NASCAR executive Ben Kennedy said when the Chicago event was announced in 2022.",
      "There was some concern for drivers and their teams about the course ahead of the first weekend, and it wasn't exactly warmly received by local businesses and residents because of the street closures in a heavily trafficked area for tourists in the summer.",
      "But organizers have shrunk the construction schedule from 43 days in 2023 to 25 this year. Based on input from fans, they also have made adjustments to the race viewing areas and moved the concert stage to the start-finish line. Admission is free for kids 12 and under on Saturday and Sunday this year.",
      "The weekend also has won over at least some people inside of NASCAR.",
      "\u201cThis was very different. But now it\u2019s fun to see and hear from people in the industry that are coming in early, and they\u2019re going to just enjoy the city for a few days,\u201d Giese said. \u201cThe one piece that I hear from our drivers, especially, is they love just staying right at a hotel right across the street. They\u2019re walking across Michigan Avenue and they\u2019re at the course.\u201d",
      "Quite often with an umbrella. Wet weather had a major effect on each of the first two editions. Heavy rain nearly scuttled the inaugural weekend, and last year's Cup Series race was shortened because of a rain delay and fading sunlight.",
      "When the drivers were on the course, the racing was compelling. Shane van Gisbergen outdueled Justin Haley and Chase Elliott on his way to a historic Cup victory in 2023, and Alex Bowman stopped an 80-race drought with his victory last year.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019ve been up against it as far as conditions are concerned,\u201d Joe Gibbs Racing driver Denny Hamlin said. \"The track has been good, it\u2019s been racy and has passing zones and the scenery is fantastic as far as the backdrop we are racing in. There\u2019s a lot of positives for the Chicago Street Race.",
      "\"It will probably move around in the future, but it\u2019s in the mold in which I would like to see any street race they continue to implement in the future.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The WNBA is expanding to 18 teams over the next five years, with Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia all set to join the league by 2030.",
      "Cleveland will begin play in 2028, Detroit in 2029 and Philadelphia the season after, assuming they get approval from the NBA and WNBA Board of Governors. Toronto and Portland will enter the league next year.",
      "\u201cThe demand for women\u2019s basketball has never been higher, and we are thrilled to welcome Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia to the WNBA family,\u201d WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said. \u201cThis historic expansion is a powerful reflection of our league\u2019s extraordinary momentum, the depth of talent across the game, and the surging demand for investment in women\u2019s professional basketball.\u201d",
      "All three new teams announced Monday have NBA ownership groups. Each paid a $250 million expansion fee, which is about five times as much as Golden State dished out for a team a few years ago. All three teams will also be investing more money through building practice facilities and other such amenities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a natural fit that when you already have this basketball-related infrastructure, these strategies, cultures that you find to be successful, combinations of personnel that you find to be successful,\u201d said Nic Barlage, CEO of Rock Entertainment Group and the Cavaliers. \u201cExtending that into the WNBA, is just a natural next progression, especially if you have a desire to grow like we do.\u201d",
      "Both Cleveland and Detroit had WNBA teams in the past and Philadelphia was the home for an ABL team.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge win for Detroit and the WNBA,\u201d Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores said. \u201cToday marks the long-hoped-for return of the WNBA to a city with deep basketball roots and a championship tradition. Detroit played a key role in the league\u2019s early growth, and we\u2019re proud to reignite that legacy as the WNBA ascends to new heights. Our plans will bring new energy, investment and infrastructure to our city and the WNBA, and additional resources to our community.\u201d",
      "Detroit sports stars Grant Hill, Chris Webber and Jared Goff will have minority ownership stakes in the team.",
      "The Cleveland and Detroit ownership groups said the Rockers and Shock \u2014 the names of the previous teams \u2014 would be considered but they\u2019d do their due diligence before deciding on what the franchises will be called.",
      "\u201cRockers will be a part of the mix for sure, but we are at this point, we\u2019re not going to commit to a brand identity because we want to really get into it with our fans, do some research, be very thorough and thoughtful in that process,\u201d Barlage said.",
      "The Detroit and Cleveland teams will play at the NBA arenas that currently exist, while Philadelphia is planning on a new building that will be completed hopefully by 2030.",
      "\u201cWe tell the city it\u2019s going to open in 2031. We\u2019re hoping for 2030,\u201d said Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment Managing Partner and co-founder Josh Harris, who owns the 76ers. \u201cSo we\u2019re trying to underpromise and overdeliver. But, right now it\u2019s 2031, so that we have a year gap, you know. We\u2019ve got the Xfinity center, the Wells Fargo, they\u2019ll play there.\u201d",
      "Adding these three teams will give the league more natural rivalries with another team on the East Coast and Detroit and Cleveland near each other.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s some great historical rivalries in the NBA among these cities and, I think that will carry over to the WNBA,\u201d Detroit Pistons vice president Arn Tellem said. \u201cI would love nothing more to have a rivalry like we do in the NBA with Cleveland and Indiana, Philadelphia and New York and all these great cities and, and I think we will.\u201d",
      "Engelbert said she was impressed with the number of cities that bid for expansion teams, a list that included St. Louis; Kansas City, Mo.; Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tenn.; Miami; Denver; Charlotte, N.C.; and Houston.",
      "\u201cThere are a variety of cities that obviously bid, and one of those I wanted to shout out \u2014 because they have such a strong history in this league and their great ownership group \u2014 is Houston,\u201d Engelbert said. \u201cThe Houston Comets were just an amazing one, the first four inaugural championships in the WNBA. So I would say that\u2019s the one, obviously, we have our eye on. (Owner) Tilman (Feritta) has been a great supporter of the WNBA, and we\u2019ll stay tuned on that.\u201d",
      "Engelbert went on to say that she wanted to spread out the expansion over a few years to not dilute the talent pool.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t know the demand would be where the demand ended up when we ran the process last fall into the winter,\u201d Engelbert said. \u201cGiven the very high demand and supply, we wanted to evaluate, too, because we\u2019re very careful about, you know, making sure we\u2019re balancing the number of roster spots, the number of teams.",
      "\u201cBut one thing I\u2019m very struck by as we get into a new media deal, as the media market evolves, you know, being in these three big basketball cities is going to help from a media perspective, a corporate partners perspective.\u201d",
      "All the metrics, such as attendance, television ratings and sponsorships, have been on the rise the last few seasons.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re seeing the key performance indicators around the business, but then also just the communal impact of having a women\u2019s professional sports team,\u201d Barlage said. \u201cThe largest growing segment of our Cavs youth academy, which serves 60,000 kids across the state of Ohio and upstate New York, the fastest growing segment is girls. You know, it\u2019s growing at a 30% clip year over year in participation rates. And so for us to be able to create role models, to be able to create symbols of progress, to create having ambassadors within the community representing all of these things.\u201d",

      "Wimbledon is preparing for the possibility of record-breaking Day 1 heat as the oldest Grand Slam tournament gets started",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Wimbledon was preparing for the possibility of record-breaking Day 1 heat as the oldest Grand Slam tournament got started Monday.",
      "The temperature shortly before play was scheduled to begin in the first matches at 11 a.m. local time was 82 degrees Fahrenheit (28 Celsius) \u2014 not yet quite reaching the 85 F (29.3 C) measured during the first day of the 2001 fortnight.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll spend the whole day going from one shady spot to another,\u201d said Sally Bolton, the chief executive officer of the All England Club.",
      "\u201cObviously, it\u2019s a very warm day. The first obvious point to make is that the athletes compete in temperatures like this all year on the tour,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cFor us Brits here at The Championships, it feels very hot.\u201d",
      "The average daytime temperature in London in June is 71 F (21.5 C), although the government's official weather office said this spring was \u201cthe UK\u2019s warmest and sunniest\" since that's been tracked.",
      "Wimbledon, like other tennis tournaments, monitors air temperature, surface temperature and humidity for a heat-stress reading that, if it exceeds 30.1 C (about 86 F), allows for 10-minute breaks between the second and third sets of women's matches or between the third and fourth sets of men's matches.",
      "Among other precautions being taken Monday, Bolton said, were having more ice on court available for players to use to cool off, rotating ball girls and boys more frequently \u201cif we feel we need to,\u201d and giving regular breaks to workers around the grounds.",
      "As for fans, Bolton said, \u201cwe're offering the same advice as lots of the medical professionals: Come prepared. Bring a hat. Wear sunscreen. Wear light clothing if you can. Take breaks out of the sun. We\u2019ve got over 100 water points around the grounds, so definitely stay hydrated. And keep an eye on your friends and others around you. If people look like they're suffering a little bit from heat stress, we\u2019ve got a really significantly sized medical team here.\u201d",
      "This is nothing compared to what athletes and spectators experience during the local summers when the Australian Open is held in Melbourne in January or the U.S. Open is held in New York in August and September, when temperatures regularly get to 90 F (32 C) and can top 100 F (38 C).",
      "A 2023 Associated Press analysis showed the average high temperatures felt during the U.S. Open and the three other major tennis tournaments steadily have gotten higher and more dangerous in recent decades, reflecting the climate change that has created record heat waves. For the players, it can inhibit them from playing their best and, worse, increase the likelihood of heat-related illness.",
      "On Monday, fans were using umbrellas to offer shade, not protection from the drizzles often seen around these parts. A year ago, because of persistent showers, it took four days \u2014 instead of the scheduled two \u2014 to complete the first round.",
      "Thinking back to the rain-filled Wimbledon of 2024, Bolton joked: \u201cWe\u2019re not used to these sort of temperatures, but we\u2019re absolutely ready for it \u2014 and actually delighted that it's sunny and not wet, like it was last year.\u201d",

Basel is Switzerland\u2019s third-most-populous city and is situated in the northwest of the country, bordering both France and Germany. The Dreil\u00e4ndereck of Basel, also known as the tripoint, is a monument marking the exact point where the borders meet. Tennis great Roger Federer was born in Basel and is a big fan of its local soccer team.",
      "Stadium: St. Jakob-Park is Switzerland\u2019s largest soccer venue, with a capacity of 34,250. It will host five matches, including the final on July 27 and the home nation\u2019s opening match on Wednesday. It is the home of Swiss national champion Basel so has regularly hosted Champions League matches as well as Euro 2008 quarterfinals and a semifinal, and a Europa League final in 2016. The stadium is nicknamed \u201cJoggeli\u201d by the fans \u2014 a diminutive of \u201cJakob\u201d in the local dialect. It has also hosted many concerts.",
      "Switzerland\u2019s federal capital is located in the west-central part of the country. Bern city center is largely medieval and has been recognized by UNESCO as a Cultural World Heritage Site. The most famous sights are the Zytglogge, an elaborate medieval clock tower with moving puppets, and the M\u00fcnster, an impressive 15th century Gothic cathedral \u2014 the tallest in Switzerland. There is also a museum dedicated to Albert Einstein, at his former residence.",
      "Stadium: Stadion Wankdorf is the country's second-largest soccer stadium, with a capacity of 29,800. It is the home of the Young Boys soccer team. The venue opened in 2005 and was built on the grounds of the stadium that hosted the 1954 World Cup final. Bruce Springsteen, Elton John and Red Hot Chilli Peppers are among those to have played concerts in the stadium. It will host four matches at Euro 2025, including World Cup winner Spain\u2019s opening match against Portugal on July 3 as well as a quarterfinal.",
      "The second-most populous city in Switzerland, Geneva is a center for international diplomacy and finance. It hosts the highest number of international organizations in the world \u2014 including the European headquarters of the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the Red Cross. The city is located in southwestern Switzerland, almost encircled by the French border, in a picturesque basin at the tip of Lake Geneva and has a clear view of Mont Blanc, the highest Alpine peak.",
      "Stadium: Stade de Gen\u00e8ve has a capacity of 26,750 and was completed in 2003 after three years of construction. It hosted three group stage games during Euro 2008 and held other international fixtures, notably a friendly between Argentina and Portugal in 2011 \u2014 the first time Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo faced each other while playing for their countries. It regularly holds rugby matches and even ice hockey games. It will host five matches at Euro 2025, including a quarterfinal and semifinal.",
      "With a population of approximately 83,000 people, Lucerne is the most populous city in central Switzerland. It boasts the oldest covered bridge in Europe, built in 1333. It also has a colorful old town, where the buildings are decorated with murals depicting village life and hunting scenes from the olden days. That adds to the picturesque quality of Lucerne, which is set on the shores of Lake Lucerne and the River Reuss.",
      "Stadium: Allmend Stadion Luzern, which opened in 2011, was completely rebuilt after the previous stadium was deemed no longer suitable for use in the Swiss Super League. It has a matchday capacity of 14,350 and will be used for three group stage matches \u2014 all involving the two tournament debutants, Poland and Wales.",
      "Situated near the Italian and French borders, Sion is one of the driest and sunniest areas of Switzerland. Sion is one of Europe\u2019s most significant prehistoric sites with the first settlements dating back to 6200 BC. The city is dotted with hills, the highest of which is Tourbillon with the ruins of a castle. On the opposite hill stands the Basilique de Val\u00e8re, which houses the oldest playable organ in the world, built in the early 1430s. Sion has had multiple bids to host the Winter Olympics but never won.",
      "Stadium: The Stade de Tourbillon is the smallest of all the venues for Euro 2025 as it has a matchday capacity of just 7,750. It has nevertheless hosted a number of men\u2019s international matches, including one of Switzerland\u2019s qualifiers for Euro 2020. It is named after the castle that overlooks the city.",
      "Nestled in a northeastern valley between Lake Constance and the Appenzell Alps, St. Gallen is one of the highest cities in Switzerland. Its university is considered one of the best business schools in Europe and its Abbey District, which includes a medieval monastic library, has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",
      "Stadium: Arena St. Gallen opened in 2008 and will have a capacity of 16,300 at Euro 2025, where it will host three group stage matches \u2014 including defending champion England\u2019s game against Wales. The city\u2019s largest solar-electric power plant was installed on the stadium roof in 2015. The system was expanded at the start of this year and will now generate enough solar power for the needs of approximately 288 four-person households.",
      "Thun is located about 30 kilometers southeast of Bern, where the river Aare flows out of Lake Thun. It has stunning views of the Bernese Alps. There is also a 12th-century castle, with impressive turrets, overlooking the old town.",
      "Stadium: Arena Thun is the second smallest of the venues, with a capacity of 8,100. It opened in 2011 and was built on the site of the old stadium. Natural turf will be laid over the existing artificial turf for the three group stage matches it will host during Euro 2025, including world champion Spain against Belgium.",
      "Zurich is the most populous city in Switzerland and lies in the north of the country near the Alps. The Old Town stretches on both sides of the river Limmat, which flows out of Lake Zurich. It is an international hub for banking and insurance and also the home to FIFA.",
      "Stadium: Stadion Letzigrund has a capacity of 22,700 and is home to an athletics club and three soccer teams. Concerts have been staged there as well as men\u2019s and women\u2019s international matches and three group stage games at Euro 2008. It will host five matches at Euro 2025, including two of defending champion England\u2019s group games and a quarterfinal and semifinal. In 1960, Armin Hary became the first man to run 100 meters in 10 seconds on the track at the old Letzigrund stadium, which was demolished and rebuilt, reopening in 2007. Many athletes have set world records at the Weltklasse Z\u00fcrich, a track and field meeting that has been held at the stadium for nearly 100 years.",

      "This year\u2019s visit to Wimbledon is special for two-time champion Petra Kvitova",
      "LONDON -- This year's visit to Wimbledon is special for Petra Kvitova.",
      "It marks her return to competition at the All England Club \u2014 the site of her two greatest triumphs as a professional tennis player \u2014 after missing the event last year while on maternity leave.",
      "And it also marks her farewell to the grass-court Grand Slam tournament she won in 2011 and 2014: Kvitova, a 35-year-old left-hander from the Czech Republic, announced 1 1/2 weeks ago that she plans to leave the tour after the U.S. Open, which ends in September.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to see that she\u2019s retiring, because I remember playing her when I just started,\u201d said Aryna Sabalenka, 27, the three-time major champion who is seeded No. 1 at the All England Club. \u201cI\u2019m kind of sad. I was thinking when I saw the news: \u2018Come on. Give it try. Why? Why would you retire? Keep going.\u2019\u201d",
      "Kvitova, who received a wild-card invitation from the tournament, was scheduled to play in the first round of Wimbledon on Tuesday against No. 10 seed Emma Navarro of the United States.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll be amazing, for sure. It\u2019s my favorite tournament. It always has been and it always will be. So it\u2019ll be very nice to be back,\u201d Kvitova said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s always brought me so many memories. Some really good memories, of course. But also bad memories, because losing with the pressure there is hard. Even with the two best results of my career, I do feel like sometimes the losses were very, very painful. But at the end of the day, winning two titles is what counts the most.\u201d",
      "Kvitova's first two appearances at the tournament she refers to as \u201cWimby\u201d did not go perfectly. She lost her opening matches in both 2008 and 2009.",
      "But the following year, she made it all the way the semifinals. And then, in 2011, Kvitova beat Maria Sharapova 6-3, 6-4 in the final. Three years later, Kvitova earned her second trophy, defeating Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-0 in the title match.",
      "\u201cIt took me a while,\u201d Kvitova said, \u201cto get used to the grass.\u201d",
      "Kvitova, who's been ranked as high as No. 2 but is currently outside the top 500 because of her absence and a 1-6 record since her February comeback, also associates two other key memories with Wimbledon. Jiri Vanek, her coach since 2016, proposed to Kvitova at Centre Court and they're now married. Their first child, a son named Petr, was born during the middle weekend of the 2024 fortnight.",
      "Kvitova described her 17 months away from the tour as feeling akin to just a short break.",
      "\u201cIt actually feels like I never quit. It feels like I\u2019ve been here every year,\u201d she said before returning to Grand Slam action at the French Open in May. \u201cMy mindset is still in a good place, so it feels good to be here. And my game is getting better.\u201d",
      "Motherhood does present its challenges, as for any working mom. The biggest difficulty, Kvitova said, has been being away from her family when they don't accompany her when she is playing.",
      "\u201cTraveling together is not easy sometimes, either. The worst part is the logistics that come with it. Having so much stuff. Being in the hotel room it can be a little tough, especially when they\u2019re small. He is starting to crawl and everything, so it\u2019s a mess everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it also is fun. He\u2019s a very good boy, so that makes it all a little bit easier.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Matt Freese made three saves in six shootout attempts to lead the U.S. to victory over Costa Rica in the quarterfinals of the Gold Cup",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- After losing a second-half lead to Costa Rica, this young U.S. side was forced into a shootout with the daunting task of facing goalkeeper Keylor Navas.",
      "Matt Freese studied for this. Literally.",
      "The late-blooming national team rookie, who made a costly mistake in the previous match, actually conducted an in-depth research project in college at Harvard about penalty kicks.",
      "Freese spent the flight to Minneapolis reviewing his findings and examining Costa Rica's tendencies, time well spent that fueled his steely performance in the CONCACAF Gold Cup quarterfinal victory on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cTo be able to rely on that type of thing and deal with a lot of statistics and read the game and read their hips, things like that, is massive,\u201d Freese said after making three saves in the six-round shootout won 4-3 by the Americans after a 2-2 tie in regulation.",
      "The Americans play Guatemala in the semifinals on Wednesday in St. Louis. If the U.S. can rely on Freese like this moving forward, that too would be an enormous boost.",
      "The 26-year-old native of Pennsylvania, who has displaced for now 2022 World Cup and 2023 Gold Cup starter Matt Turner, knocked away shootout attempts by Juan Pablo Vargas, Francisco Calvo and Andy Rojas. Calvo scored on Freese in the 12th minute on a penalty kick.",
      "Freese, a little-used backup for Major League Soccer's Philadelphia Union before a trade to New York City FC in 2023 jump-started his career, has had little time with the national team for training. His path was only cleared this spring by injuries to Patrick Schulte and Zack Steffen.",
      "But new coach Mauricio Pochettino has been determined to push his young players into the deep end during this biennial championship for North America, Central America and the Caribbean, with Freese at the forefront of the experiment.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just got to be ready for whatever game I get, for whatever moment is there for me,\u201d said Freese, who gave up one goal in three group stage matches. \u201cHe\u2019s shown a lot of faith in me. That\u2019s something I\u2019m really grateful for, and it\u2019s my job to repay him and help the team win.\u201d",
      "The goal Freese gave up during the group stage was quite a gaffe, a misfired clearing attempt against Haiti that set up the tying goal in a game the U.S. won 2-1. But Pochettino and his staff had no problem sending Freese back to the net for the knockout rounds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to show you can bounce back, an opportunity to learn and quickly move on to the next,\u201d Freese said.",
      "Turner played only three club matches in the recently ended season for Crystal Palace, all in the FA Cup and none since March 1. The critical position is wide open for Freese \u2014 or anyone \u2014 to seize it with the North American World Cup looming next summer.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s good for Matt, for the rest of the keepers, to see that they can have the possibility and deal with the pressure,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cBecause you never know what\u2019s going to happen in one year. Now is the moment to test or to give the possibility to show that they can deal with that stress and perform.\u201d",
      "Pochettino didn't directly answer a question about whether Freese has passed Turner on the depth chart. But the native of Argentina, who began his playing career with the same club that Navas stars for and briefly managed him with Paris Saint-Germain, was clearly pleased by the way his keeper stepped up with one of the best in the world during the dramatic shootout.",
      "After each save, Freese told himself he wanted another one. After the third diving stop, he became especially demonstrative \u2014 nodding his head and sticking out his tongue toward his cheering teammates at midfield.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s done extremely well. He\u2019s worked extremely hard,\" said Diego Luna, who scored his first international goal for the U.S. in the first half. \u201cThese are the type of moments that we live for.\u201d",

The youngest was Jason Day, who was 19 in 2007.",

After Greyserman two-putted from 39 feet for par and Potgieter did the same from 20 feet, Kirk had a chance to win it with a 9-foot putt only to push it to the right of the cup to extend the playoff.",
      "The trio then went to the par-3, 158-yard 15th and Greyserman was the only one who was accurate off the tee and didn't take advantage.",
      "The trend continued on the par-4 16th, where both Greyserman and Potgieter missed 16-foot putts with a chance to win.",
      "At the par-5 14th, Greyserman hit is drive 361 yards \u2014 his longest of the week \u2014 and was just 2 yards behind Potgieter's blast. Potgieter hit his approach from 195 yards to 19 feet and he pulled his putt. Greyserman two-putted from from 29 feet for birdie.",
      "Back at No. 15 for a second time in the playoff, Greyserman two-putted from 34 feet and then Potgieter finally ended it.",

      "A federal judge has allowed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple to proceed, rejecting the company's request to dismiss the case",
      "A federal judge on Monday rebuffed Apple's request to throw out a U.S. government lawsuit alleging the technology trendsetter has built a maze of illegal barriers to protect the iPhone from competition and fatten its profit margins.",
      "The 33\u2014page opinion from U.S. District Judge Xavier Neals in New Jersey will enable an antitrust lawsuit that the U.S. Justice Department filed against Apple 15 months ago to proceed. Neals has set a timetable that could see the case come to trial in 2027.",
      "Apple has sought to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing the Justice Department had distorted the contours of the smartphone market and made a series of other misinterpretations that warranted the case be thrown out.",
      "But Neals decided there is enough evidence to support the Justice Department's market definitions and concluded the case's key allegations merited further examination at trial.",
      "The case seeks to pierce the digital fortress that Apple Inc., based in Cupertino, California, has built around the iPhone, iPad and other products to create a so-called \u201cwalled garden\u201d allowing its hardware and software to mesh seamlessly for users.",
      "The Justice Department alleges that walled garden has mostly turned into a shield against competition, creating market conditions that enable it to charge higher prices and stifle innovation.",
      "The lawsuit \u201csets forth several allegations of technological barricades that constitute anticompetitive conduct,\u201d Neals wrote in his opinion. The judge also concluded the Justice Department had pointed toward enough areas of troubling conduct that raised the \u201cdangerous possibility\u201d that Apple has turned the iPhone into an illegal monopoly.",
      "In a Monday statement, Apple reiterated its position that the Justice Department's case \u201cis wrong on the facts and the law, and we will continue to vigorously fight it in court.\u201d",
      "The antitrust lawsuit isn't the only legal headache threatening to undercut its profits, which totaled $94 billion on sales of $295 billion in its fiscal year ending last September.",
      "Another federal judge in April issued a civil contempt order banning Apple from collecting any fees from in-app transactions on the iPhone that are funneled through other options besides its once-exclusive payment processing system that charged commissions ranging from 15% to 30%.",
      "Apple also could lose a more than $20 billion annual payment that it gets for making Google the default search tool on the iPhone and other products as part of another antitrust case brought by the Justice Department. A federal judge in Washington D.C. is considering whether to ban the deals with Apple as part of a shake-up being proposed to address Google's illegal monopoly in searc h.",
      "Neals' decision to allow the Justice Department's antitrust case to proceed came on the same day that Apple was hit with a lawsuit by app maker Proton amplifying the accusations of wrongful conduct by the company. The lawsuit, which will seek to be certified as a class action presenting thousands of developers who have made iPhone apps, is asking for punitive damages against Apple, as well as a court order to dismantle its walled garden.",

      "Giving Funds is GoFundMe\u2019s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered",
      "NEW YORK -- GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall.",
      "Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived.",
      "\u201cIt was just a bit of a thing,\u201d he added. \"If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.\u201d",
      "Giving Funds are GoFundMe's latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company's DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers \u2014 products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts.",
      "To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur's circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they\u2019re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they\u2019re coming in and they\u2019re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cThat connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.\u201d",
      "Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit.",
      "The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals.",
      "There's since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements.",
      "GoFundMe's Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company's standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors.",
      "Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving \u2014 something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn't occurred because DAFs have been framed as \u201cwealth management products.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a giving product,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s something for everybody. And you don\u2019t need to know the words \u2018donor advised fund.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d",
      "DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes \u2014 even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023.",
      "Cadogan believes GoFundMe's culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends' charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas.",
      "That \u201cdynamic, alive community\u201d is very different from the \u201cfairly static, passive\u201d financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially inspiring the money to move,\u201d he said.",
      "Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning.",
      "Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative's recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the \u201csweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.\u201d",
      "The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it's a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are \u201cavailable-to-everyone vehicles\" considering that half run balances under $50,000.",
      "\u201cGivers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.\u201d",
      "But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe's entrance as \u201ca game changer\u201d that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years.",
      "Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a \u201csavings account\" for \"good works.\"",
      "\u201cAnd GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,\u201d she said.",

      "A tech industry trade group has sued Arkansas over two new law placing limits on content on social media platforms",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A tech industry trade group sued Arkansas Friday over two new laws that would place limits on content on social media platforms and would allow parents of children who killed themselves to sue over content on the platforms.",
      "The lawsuit by NetChoice filed in federal court in Fayetteville, Arkansas, comes months after a federal judge struck down a state law requiring parental consent before minors can create new social media accounts. The new laws were signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders earlier this year.",
      "\u201cDespite the overwhelming consensus that laws like the Social Media Safety Act are unconstitutional, Arkansas elected to respond to this Court\u2019s decision not by repealing the provisions that it held unconstitutional but by instead doubling down on its overreach,\u201d NetChoice said in its lawsuit.",
      "Arkansas is among several states that have been enacting restrictions on social media, prompted by concerns about the impact on children's mental health. NetChoice \u2014 whose members include TikTok, Facebook parent Meta, and the social platform X \u2014 challenged Arkansas' 2023 age-verification law for social media. A federal judge who initially blocked the law struck it down in March.",
      "Similar laws have been blocked by judges in Florida and Georgia.",
      "A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the latest complaint and looked forward to defending the law.",
      "One of the new laws being challenged prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm or feature it \u201cknows or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care\u201d would cause a user to kill themself, purchase a controlled substance, develop an eating disorder, develop an addiction to the platform.",
      "The lawsuit said that provision is unconstitutionally vague and doesn't offer guidance on how to determine which content would violate those restrictions, and the suit notes it would restrict content for both adults and minors.

      "The law being challenged also would allow parents whose children have died by suicide or attempted to take their lives to sue social media companies if they were exposed to content promoting or advancing self-harm and suicide. The companies could face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.",
      "NetChoice is also challenging another law that attempts to expand Arkansas' blocked restrictions on social media companies. That measure would require social media platforms to ensure minors don't receive notifications between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.",
      "The measure also would require social media companies to ensure their platform \u201cdoes not engage in practices to evoke any addiction or compulsive behavior.\u201d The suit argues that the law doesn't explain how to comply with that restriction and is so broadly written that it's unclear what kind of posts or material would violate it.",
      "\u201cWhat is \u2018addictive\u2019 to some minors may not be addictive to others. Does allowing teens to share photos with each other evoke addiction?\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "In the time before widespread vaccination, young children often lost their lives to devastating infectious diseases that ran rampant in America",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- In the time before widespread vaccination, death often came early.",
      "Devastating infectious diseases ran rampant in America, killing millions of children and leaving others with lifelong health problems. These illnesses were the main reason why nearly one in five children in 1900 never made it to their fifth birthday.",
      "Over the next century, vaccines virtually wiped out long-feared scourges like polio and measles and drastically reduced the toll of many others. Today, however, some preventable, contagious diseases are making a comeback as vaccine hesitancy pushes immunization rates down. And well-established vaccines are facing suspicion even from public officials, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, running the federal health department.",
      "\u201cThis concern, this hesitancy, these questions about vaccines are a consequence of the great success of the vaccines \u2013 because they eliminated the diseases,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with the disease, you don\u2019t respect or even fear it. And therefore you don\u2019t value the vaccine.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine activists even portray the shots as a threat, focusing on the rare risk of side effects while ignoring the far larger risks posed by the diseases themselves \u2014 and years of real-world data that experts say proves the vaccines are safe.",
      "Some Americans know the reality of these preventable diseases all too well. For them, news of measles outbreaks and rising whooping cough cases brings back terrible memories of lives forever changed \u2013 and a longing to spare others from similar pain.",
      "With a mother\u2019s practiced, guiding hand, 80-year-old Janith Farnham helped steer her 60-year-old daughter\u2019s walker through a Sioux Falls art center. They stopped at a painting of a cow wearing a hat.",
      "Janith pointed to the hat, then to her daughter Jacque\u2019s Minnesota Twins cap. Jacque did the same.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so funny!\u201d Janith said, leaning in close to say the words in sign language too.",
      "Jacque was born with congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause a host of issues including hearing impairment, eye problems, heart defects and intellectual disabilities. There was no vaccine against rubella back then, and Janith contracted the viral illness very early in the pregnancy, when she had up to a 90% chance of giving birth to a baby with the syndrome.",
      "Janith recalled knowing \u201cthings weren\u2019t right\u201d almost immediately. The baby wouldn\u2019t respond to sounds or look at anything but lights. She didn\u2019t like to be held close. Her tiny heart sounded like it purred \u2013 evidence of a problem that required surgery at four months old.",
      "Janith did all she could to help Jacque thrive, sending her to the Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind and using skills she honed as a special education teacher. She and other parents of children with the syndrome shared insights in a support group.",
      "Meanwhile, the condition kept taking its toll. As a young adult, Jacque developed diabetes, glaucoma and autistic behaviors. Eventually, arthritis set in.",
      "Today, Jacque lives in an adult residential home a short drive from Janith's place. Above her bed is a net overflowing with stuffed animals. On a headboard shelf are photo books Janith created, filled with memories like birthday parties and trips to Mount Rushmore.",
      "Jacque\u2019s days typically begin with an insulin shot and breakfast before she heads off to a day program. She gets together with her mom four or five days a week. They often hang out at Janith\u2019s townhome, where Jacque has another bedroom decorated with her own artwork and quilts Janith sewed for her. Jacque loves playing with Janith\u2019s dog, watching sports on television and looking up things on her iPad.",
      "Janith marvels at Jacque\u2019s sense of humor, gratefulness, curiosity and affectionate nature despite all she\u2019s endured. Jacque is generous with kisses and often signs \u201cdouble I love yous\u201d to family, friends and new people she meets.",
      "\u201cWhen you live through so much pain and so much difficulty and so much challenge, sometimes I think: Well, she doesn\u2019t know any different,\u201d Janith said.",
      "Given what her family has been through, Janith believes younger people are being selfish if they choose not to get their children the MMR shot against measles, mumps and rubella.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more than frustrating. I mean, I get angry inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what can happen, and I just don\u2019t want anybody else to go through this.\u201d",
      "More than half a century has passed, but Patricia Tobin still vividly recalls getting home from work, opening the car door and hearing her mother scream. Inside the house, her little sister Karen lay unconscious on the bathroom floor.",
      "It was 1970, and Karen was 6. She\u2019d contracted measles shortly after Easter. While an early vaccine was available, it wasn\u2019t required for school in Miami where they lived. Karen\u2019s doctor discussed immunizing the first grader, but their mother didn't share his sense of urgency.",
      "\u201cIt's not that she was against it,\" Tobin said. \"She just thought there was time.\u201d",
      "Then came a measles outbreak. Karen \u2013 who Tobin described as a \u201cvery endearing, sweet child\u201d who would walk around the house singing \u2013 quickly became very sick. The afternoon she collapsed in the bathroom, Tobin, then 19, called the ambulance. Karen never regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cShe immediately went into a coma and she died of encephalitis,\u201d said Tobin, who stayed at her bedside in the hospital. \u201cWe never did get to speak to her again.\u201d",
      "Today, all states require that children get certain vaccines to attend school. But a growing number of people are making use of exemptions allowed for medical, religious or philosophical reasons. Vanderbilt\u2019s Schaffner said fading memories of measles outbreaks were exacerbated by a fraudulent, retracted study claiming a link between the MMR shot and autism.",
      "The result? Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very upset by how cavalier people are being about the measles,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that they realize how destructive this is.\u201d",
      "One of Lora Duguay\u2019s earliest memories is lying in a hospital isolation ward with her feverish, paralyzed body packed in ice. She was three years old.",
      "\u201cI could only see my parents through a glass window. They were crying and I was screaming my head off,\u201d said Duguay, 68. \u201cThey told my parents I would never walk or move again.\u201d",
      "It was 1959 and Duguay, of Clearwater, Florida, had polio. It mostly preyed on children and was one of the most feared diseases in the U.S., experts say, causing some terrified parents to keep children inside and avoid crowds during epidemics.",
      "Given polio's visibility, the vaccine against it was widely and enthusiastically welcomed. But the early vaccine that Duguay got was only about 80% to 90% effective. Not enough people were vaccinated or protected yet to stop the virus from spreading.",
      "Duguay initially defied her doctors. After intensive treatment and physical therapy, she walked and even ran \u2013 albeit with a limp. She got married, raised a son and worked as a medical transcriptionist.",
      "But in her early 40s, she noticed she couldn\u2019t walk as far as she used to. A doctor confirmed she was in the early stages of post-polio syndrome, a neuromuscular disorder that worsens over time.",
      "One morning, she tried to stand up and couldn\u2019t move her left leg.",
      "After two weeks in a rehab facility, she started painting to stay busy. Eventually, she joined arts organizations and began showing and selling her work. Art \"gives me a sense of purpose,\u201d she said.",
      "These days, she can't hold up her arms long enough to create big oil paintings at an easel. So she pulls her wheelchair up to an electric desk to paint on smaller surfaces like stones and petrified wood.",
      "The disease that changed her life twice is no longer a problem in the U.S. So many children get the vaccine \u2014 which is far more effective than earlier versions \u2014 that it doesn't just protect individuals but it prevents occasional cases that arrive in the U.S. from spreading further. \u201c Herd immunity \" keeps everyone safe by preventing outbreaks that can sicken the vulnerable.",
      "Every night, Katie Van Tornhout rubs a plaster cast of a tiny foot, a vestige of the daughter she lost to whooping cough at just 37 days old.",
      "Callie Grace was born on Christmas Eve 2009 after Van Tornhout and her husband tried five years for a baby. She was six weeks early but healthy.",
      "\u201cShe loved to have her feet rubbed,\" said the 40-year-old Lakeville, Indiana mom. \"She was this perfect baby.\u201d",
      "When Callie turned a month old, she began to cough, prompting a visit to the doctor, who didn\u2019t suspect anything serious. By the following night, Callie was doing worse. They went back.",
      "In the waiting room, she became blue and limp in Van Tornhout\u2019s arms. The medical team whisked her away and beat lightly on her back. She took a deep breath and giggled.",
      "Though the giggle was reassuring, the Van Tornhouts went to the ER, where Callie\u2019s skin turned blue again. For a while, medical treatment helped. But at one point she started squirming, and medical staff frantically tried to save her.",
      "\u201cWithin minutes,\u201d Van Tornhout said, \u201cshe was gone.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout recalled sitting with her husband and their lifeless baby for four hours, \"just talking to her, thinking about what could have been.\u201d",
      "Callie\u2019s viewing was held on her original due date \u2013 the same day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called to confirm she had pertussis, or whooping cough. She was too young for the Tdap vaccine against it and was exposed to someone who hadn\u2019t gotten their booster shot.",
      "Today, next to the cast of Callie\u2019s foot is an urn with her ashes and a glass curio cabinet filled with mementos like baby shoes.",
      "\u201cMy kids to this day will still look up and say, \u2018Hey Callie, how are you?\u2019\u201d said Van Tornhout, who has four children and a stepson. \u201cShe\u2019s part of all of us every day.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout now advocates for childhood immunization through the nonprofit Vaccinate Your Family. She also shares her story with people she meets, like a pregnant customer who came into the restaurant her family ran saying she didn\u2019t want to immunize her baby. She later returned with her vaccinated four-month-old.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s up to us as adults to protect our children \u2013 like, that\u2019s what a parent\u2019s job is,\u201d Van Tornhout said. \u201cI watched my daughter die from something that was preventable \u2026 You don\u2019t want to walk in my shoes.\u201d",

      "Ticks can be active in any season and experts say it\u2019s important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ticks can be active in any season and it's important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible \u2014 especially after you've been outside hiking, gardening or enjoying nature.",
      "\u201cHumans are outside more in summer so we hear about more tick infections,\u201d said Sam Telford, an infectious diseases expert at Tufts University. But he urges caution year-round because \u201cevery season is tick season.\u201d",
      "While tick populations vary a lot regionally, some Northeastern states including Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are seeing \u201cabove average\u201d numbers of American dog ticks this year, said Telford.",
      "And New York state is seeing a higher number of reported deer tick bites this year than last year, said Saravanan Thangamani, who studies tick-borne diseases at SUNY Upstate Medical University.",
      "Ticks, like mosquitos, need to feed on blood. But instead of a quick prick, they are slow feeders \u2013 with hooked mouth parts that attach into the skin of deer, rabbits, dogs and people.",
      "There are many different species of ticks found globally and only some spread germs that can make people sick. A main worry is blacklegged ticks, also called deer ticks, which can spread Lyme disease. Once found mainly in New England and pockets of the Midwest, the ticks are now present over a wider range.",
      "A tick bite doesn't always lead to illness. \u201cIf you remove a tick within 24 hours of attachment, it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you will get infected,\u201d said Telford.",
      "Ticks are usually found low to the ground, in leaf litter or grassy areas.",
      "Check your clothing for ticks and do a full-body check including under the arms and behind ears, knees and hair.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re out all day long, try to do a quick check for ticks every few hours,\u201d said Bobbi Pritt at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWhen you go back inside, take a shower. That will wash off any unattached ticks, and you\u2019re also more likely to spot any other ticks.\"",
      "Use tweezers to remove the tick and grasp it as close to the skin as possible to pull from the head. If you don\u2019t have them handy, you can also use your fingernails, the edge of a credit card or any semi-sharp object.",
      "The best approach is to minimize tick exposure altogether.",
      "Bug sprays containing ingredients such as DEET can be sprayed on exposed skin to ward off ticks and mosquitos, said Telford.",
      "Wear long sleeves and pants, and you can also spray clothing with repellents containing permethrin, a chemical similar to a natural ingredient in chrysanthemums that makes ticks avoid the flowers.",
      "Don\u2019t forget to pay attention to outdoor pets. Medications can prevent fleas and ticks from attaching to a dog's skin. But it\u2019s still a good idea to check the fur after being outside.",
      "\u201cWherever pets can\u2019t easily groom themselves, that\u2019s where the ticks will be \u2013 on the ears, around the muzzle area, under the collar, between the toes,\u201d said Thangamani.",
      "Dogs and cats roaming outdoors can also bring ticks into the house.",
      "\u201cIf pets bring ticks in, a tick can live in the house for months until it finds its next blood meal,\u201d which could be another household member, he said.",
      "After removing the tick, keep an eye on the skin around the bite. If a rash or flu-like symptoms appear within several days or weeks, see a doctor.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend tick testing because results may not be reliable.",

      "LONDON -- Apple has revamped its app store policies in the European Union with hopes of fending off escalating fines under the 27-nation bloc's digital competition regulations.",
      "It's a last-minute bid by the iPhone maker to avoid further charges following a 500 million euro ($585 million) penalty in April. The bloc's executive Commission punished Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store, and gave it a 60-day deadline, which expired Thursday, to avoid additional, periodic fines.",
      "The changes made by Apple will make it easier for app makers to point users to better deals on digital products and options to pay for them outside of Apple's own App Store, including other websites, apps or alternative app stores.",
      "The California company is also rolling out a two-tier system of fees to accommodate app developers that want to use alternative payments.",
      "\u201cThe European Commission is requiring Apple to make a series of additional changes to the App Store,\" Apple said in a statement. \"We disagree with this outcome and plan to appeal.\u201d",

      "Apple's restrictions preventing developers from steering users to outside payment channels had been fiercely opposed by some companies.

      "A video of Kennedy's speech was shown to participants at a Gavi meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, where the vaccines group was hoping to raise at least $9 billion for the next five years.",
      "Gavi is a public-private partnership including WHO, UNICEF, the Gates Foundation and the World Bank. It has paid for more than 1 billion children to be vaccinated through routine immunization programs, saving an estimated 18 million lives. The United States has long been one of its biggest supporters; before Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, the country had pledged $1 billion through 2030.",
      "Kennedy called on Gavi \u201cto re-earn the public trust and to justify the $8 billion America has provided in funding since 2001,\u201d saying officials must \u201cconsider the best science available, even when that science contradicts established paradigms.\u201d Kennedy said until that happens, the U.S. won\u2019t contribute further to Gavi.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, said he and President Trump were concerned about how Gavi and the World Health Organization partnered together during the COVID-19 pandemic to work with social media companies \u201cto silence dissenting views, to stifle free speech and legitimate questions\u201d during a time when many people had questions about vaccine safety.",
      "Kennedy said Gavi continues to make \u201cquestionable recommendations,\u201d like advising pregnant women to get immunized against COVID-19 and funding the roll-out of a vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis in poorer countries.",
      "WHO and other health authorities have recommended pregnant women get vaccinated against COVID-19, saying they are at higher risk of severe disease.",
      "Kennedy said he has seen research that concluded that young girls vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis were more likely to die from all other causes than children who weren\u2019t immunized.",
      "Some observational studies have shown that vaccinated girls do have a higher death rate compared to unvaccinated children, but there is no evidence the deaths are caused by the vaccine.",
      "Gavi said in a statement Thursday that its \u201cutmost concern is the health and safety of children.\u201d The organization said any decision it makes on vaccines to buy is done in accordance with recommendations issued by WHO's expert vaccine group.",
      "\u201cThis ensures Gavi investments are grounded in the best available science and public health priorities,\u201d it said.

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- The first astronauts in more than 40 years from India, Poland and Hungary arrived at the International Space Station on Thursday, ferried there by SpaceX on a private flight.",
      "The crew of four will spend two weeks at the orbiting lab, performing dozens of experiments. They launched Wednesday from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center.",
      "America\u2019s most experienced astronaut, Peggy Whitson, is the commander of the visiting crew. She works for Axiom Space, the Houston company that arranged the chartered flight.",
      "Besides Whitson, the crew includes India\u2019s Shubhanshu Shukla, a pilot in the Indian Air Force; Hungary\u2019s Tibor Kapu, a mechanical engineer; and Poland\u2019s Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, a radiation expert and one of the European Space Agency\u2019s project astronauts on temporary flight duty.",
      "No one has ever visited the International Space Station from those countries before. The time anyone rocketed into orbit from those countries was in the late 1970s and 1980s, traveling with the Soviets.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to have you join our outpost of international cooperation and exploration,\" NASA's Mission Control radioed from Houston minutes after the linkup high above the North Atlantic.",
      "The new arrivals shared hugs and handshakes with the space station's seven full-time residents, celebrating with drink pouches sipped through straws. Six nations were represented: four from the U.S., three from Russia and one each from Japan, India, Poland and Hungary.",
      "\"It\u2019s so great to be here finally. It was a long quarantine,\" Whitson said, referring to the crew's extra-long isolation before liftoff to stay healthy.",
      "They went into quarantine on May 25, stuck in it as their launch kept getting delayed. The latest postponement was for space station leak monitoring, NASA wanted to make sure everything was safe following repairs to a longtime leak on the Russian side of the outpost.",
      "It's the fourth Axiom-sponsored flight to the space station since 2022. The company is one of several that are developing their own space stations due to launch in the coming years. NASA plans to abandon the International Space Station in 2030 after more than three decades of operation, and is encouraging private ventures to replace it.",

      "A federal judge on Wednesday sided with Facebook parent Meta Platforms in dismissing a copyright infringement lawsuit from a group of authors who accused the company of stealing their works to train its artificial intelligence technology",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge sided with Facebook parent Meta Platforms in dismissing a copyright infringement lawsuit from a group of authors who accused the company of stealing their works to train its artificial intelligence technology.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria was the second in a week from San Francisco's federal court to dismiss major copyright claims from book authors against the rapidly developing AI industry.",
      "Chhabria found that 13 authors who sued Meta \u201cmade the wrong arguments\u201d and tossed the case. But the judge also said that the ruling is limited to the authors in the case and does not mean that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials is lawful.",
      "\u201cThis ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,\u201d Chhabria wrote. \u201cIt stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs \u2014 a group of well-known writers that includes comedian Sarah Silverman and authors Jacqueline Woodson and Ta-Nehisi Coates \u2014 said in a statement that the \"court ruled that AI companies that \u2018feed copyright-protected works into their models without getting permission from the copyright holders or paying for them\u2019 are generally violating the law. Yet, despite the undisputed record of Meta\u2019s historically unprecedented pirating of copyrighted works, the court ruled in Meta\u2019s favor. We respectfully disagree with that conclusion.\u201d",
      "Meta said it appreciates the decision.",
      "\u201cOpen-source AI models are powering transformative innovations, productivity and creativity for individuals and companies, and fair use of copyright material is a vital legal framework for building this transformative technology,\u201d the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "Although Meta prevailed in its request to dismiss the case, it could turn out to be a pyrrhic victory. In his 40-page ruling, Chhabria repeatedly indicated reasons to believe that Meta and other AI companies have turned into serial copyright infringers as they train their technology on books and other works created by humans, and seemed to be inviting other authors to bring cases to his court presented in a manner that would allow them to proceed to trial.",
      "The judge scoffed at arguments that requiring AI companies to adhere to decades-old copyright laws would slow down advances in a crucial technology at a pivotal time. \"These products are expected to generate billions, even trillions of dollars for the companies that are developing them. If using copyrighted works to train the models is as necessary as the companies say, they will figure out a way to compensate copyright holders for it.\u201d",
      "On Monday, from the same courthouse, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that AI company Anthropic didn\u2019t break the law by training its chatbot Claude on millions of copyrighted books, but the company must still go to trial for illicitly acquiring those books from pirate websites instead of buying them.",
      "But the actual process of an AI system distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "In the Meta case, the authors had argued in court filings that Meta is \u201cliable for massive copyright infringement\u201d by taking their books from online repositories of pirated works and feeding them into Meta's flagship generative AI system Llama.",
      "Lengthy and distinctively written passages of text \u2014 such as those found in books \u2014 are highly useful for teaching generative AI chatbots the patterns of human language. \u201cMeta could and should have paid\u201d to buy and license those literary works, the authors' attorneys argued.",
      "Meta countered in court filings that U.S. copyright law \u201callows the unauthorized copying of a work to transform it into something new\u201d and that the new, AI-generated expression that comes out of its chatbots is fundamentally different from the books it was trained on.",
      "\"After nearly two years of litigation, there still is no evidence that anyone has ever used Llama as a substitute for reading Plaintiffs\u2019 books, or that they even could,\u201d Meta's attorneys argued.",
      "Meta says Llama won\u2019t output the actual works it has copied, even when asked to do so.",
      "\u201cNo one can use Llama to read Sarah Silverman\u2019s description of her childhood, or Junot Diaz\u2019s story of a Dominican boy growing up in New Jersey,\u201d its attorneys wrote.",
      "Accused of pulling those books from online \u201cshadow libraries,\" Meta has also argued that the methods it used have \u201cno bearing on the nature and purpose of its use\u201d and it would have been the same result if the company instead struck a deal with real libraries.",
      "Such deals are how Google built its online Google Books repository of more than 20 million books, though it also fought a decade of legal challenges before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "The authors' case against Meta forced CEO Mark Zuckerberg to be deposed, and has disclosed internal conversations at the company over the ethics of tapping into pirated databases that have long attracted scrutiny.",
      "\u201cAuthorities regularly shut down their domains and even prosecute the perpetrators,\u201d the authors' attorneys argued in a court filing. \"That Meta knew taking copyrighted works from pirated databases could expose the company to enormous risk is beyond dispute: it triggered an escalation to Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta executives for approval. Their gamble should not pay off.\u201d",
      "The named plaintiffs are Jacqueline Woodson, Richard Kadrey, Andrew Sean Greer, Rachel Louise Snyder, David Henry Hwang, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Laura Lippman, Matthew Klam, Junot Diaz, Sarah Silverman, Lysa TerKeurst, Christopher Golden and Christopher Farnsworth.",
      "Chhabria said in the ruling that while he had \u201cno choice\u201d but to grant Meta\u2019s summary judgment tossing the case, \u201cin the grand scheme of things, the consequences of this ruling are limited. This is not a class action, so the ruling only affects the rights of these 13 authors -- not the countless others whose works Meta used to train its models.\u201d",

      "SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rocket blasted off from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center two weeks late because of space station leak concerns. The capsule on top carried not only the three newcomers to space \u2014 none of whom were alive when their countries\u2019 first astronauts launched \u2014 but America\u2019s most experienced astronaut, Peggy Whitson.",
      "Besides Whitson, the crew includes India\u2019s Shubhanshu Shukla, a pilot in the Indian Air Force; Hungary\u2019s Tibor Kapu, a mechanical engineer; and Poland\u2019s Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, a radiation expert and one of the European Space Agency\u2019s project astronauts sometimes pressed into temporary duty.",
      "The astronauts are due to arrive at the orbiting lab the next morning.",
      "In addition to dozens of experiments, the astronauts are flying food that celebrates their heritage: Indian curry and rice with mango nectar; spicy Hungarian paprika paste; and freeze-fried Polish pierogies.",
      "Hungary\u2019s first astronaut, Bertalan Farkas, cheered on Kapu from the launch site.",
      "\u201cFor such a small country as Hungary, it is really important to collaborate in a peaceful international space cooperation,\u201d Farkas told The Associated Press. He called it \u201cone of the most important moments\" of his life.",
      "Farkas launched with the Soviets in 1980, taking along a teddy bear in a cosmonaut suit that went back up with Kapu. India and Poland\u2019s original astronauts also launched with the Soviets in the late 1970s and 1980s.",
      "Uznanski-Wisniewski carried up the Polish flag worn on his predecessor\u2019s spacesuit, noting that Miroslaw Hermaszewski was his biggest supporter until his death in 2022. India\u2019s first astronaut, Rakesh Sharma, couldn\u2019t make it to Florida for the launch; Shukla said he\u2019s been a mentor \u201cat every step of this journey\u201d and is flying a surprise gift for him.",
      "While others born in India and Hungary have flown in space before \u2014 including NASA astronaut Kalpana Chawla, who died aboard the shuttle Columbia in 2003, and two-time space tourist Charles Simonyi, of Microsoft fame \u2014 they were U.S. citizens at the time of launch.",
      "Shukla said before the flight that he hopes \u201cto ignite the curiosity of an entire generation in my country\u201d and drive innovation. Like his crewmates, he plans several outreach events with those back home.",
      "\u201cI truly believe that even though I, as an individual, am traveling to space, this is the journey of 1.4 billion people,\u201d he said.",
      "It was Axiom\u2019s fourth chartered flight to the space station since 2022 and Whitson\u2019s second time flying as an Axiom crew commander and chaperone. The trip caused her to miss her induction into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame late last month, since she was in quarantine before the flight. Whitson joined Axiom after retiring from NASA nearly a decade ago and has logged almost two years in orbit over her career.",
      "Once opposed to nontraditional station guests, NASA now throws out the welcome mat, charging for their food and upkeep while insisting that an experienced astronaut accompany them.",
      "It\u2019s all part of NASA\u2019s push to open space \u2014 moon included \u2014 to private businesses. Axiom is among several U.S. companies planning to launch their own space stations in the next few years. The goal is for them to be up and running before the international station comes down in 2031 after more than three decades of operation.",
      "Access to space \u201cis not only for the biggest agencies anymore \u2014 space is for everyone,\u201d Poland\u2019s Uznanski-Wisniewski said ahead of liftoff. He repeated the sentiment upon reaching orbit.",
      "Hungarians want to \u201csit at the same table with the giants,\u201d said Kapu. Through this mission, \u201cHungary gets one step closer to the stars.\u201d",
      "They should have flown earlier this year, but their mission was delayed following a switch in SpaceX capsules. The change enabled NASA\u2019s two stuck astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to return to Earth in March sooner than planned.",
      "The Axiom astronauts faced more launch delays once arriving in Florida. SpaceX had to fix an oxygen leak in its rocket, then NASA put the crew\u2019s visit on indefinite hold while monitoring repairs to longtime air leaks on the Russian side of the space station.",

      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters searching through the debris of Russia's nightly assault on their cities found a drone that was different to the rest",
      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters picking up the debris from Russia\u2019s nightly assault on their cities found a weapon that stood out from the rest.",
      "It had an advanced camera, a computing platform powered by artificial intelligence and a radio link, allowing an operator to pilot it remotely from Russia. It also contained new, Iranian-made, anti-jamming technology, according to a Ukrainian drone expert.",
      "Most Russian attack drones are black, said Serhii Beskrestnov, an electronics expert more widely known as Flash. The new one, he told The Associated Press, was white.",
      "Inside, there were no markings or labels consistent with Russian-made drones. Instead, the stickers followed a \u201cstandard Iran labeling system,\u201d Beskrestnov said.",
      "Experts who spoke to AP said the labels are not conclusive proof but the English-language words are consistent with how Iran marks its drones. It is quite possible, they said, that it was sold by Iran to Russia to test in combat.",
      "Moscow has pummeled Ukraine almost nightly with Iranian-designed drones throughout the course of the war, now in its fourth year. They swarm above Ukrainian cities, their moped-like sound filling the air, as air defenses and sharpshooters take aim. While some carry warheads, many are decoys.",
      "Russia is improving its drone technology and tactics, striking Ukraine with increasing success. But the U.K's Defense Ministry said Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran will \u201clikely negatively impact the future provision of Iranian military equipment to Russia,\" since Tehran had supplied \u201csignificant quantities\u201d of attack drones to Moscow.",
      "Israel\u2019s military would not comment on what it struck. Although it has carried out sweeping attacks across Iranian military facilities and the U.S. bombed nuclear sites, the impact on Iran\u2019s drone industry is not yet clear.",
      "The anti-jammer in the latest drone discovered in Ukraine contained new Iranian technology, suggested Beskrestnov. Other components in Russia's drones often come from Russia, China and the West.",
      "Although Russia's drones are based on an Iranian design, the majority are now made in Russia.",
      "And because much of the technology to make them, including the Iranian software and technical expertise, has already been transferred to Russia, the immediate impact on Moscow\u2019s drone program could be limited, experts said.",
      "However, if Israel struck facilities producing drones and components \u2014 such as engines and anti-jamming units \u2014 which are shipped to Russia, then Moscow could face supply shortages, experts suggested.",
      "Moscow makes its Shahed \u2014 meaning \u201cwitness\u201d in Farsi \u2014 drones based on an Iranian model in a highly secure factory in central Russia.",
      "The Alabuga plant in the Tatarstan region took delivery of its first Iranian drones in 2022 after Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal. It later established its own production lines, churning out thousands of them.",
      "The upgrades identified from debris in Ukraine are the latest in a series of innovations that began with Russia buying drones directly from Iran in the fall of 2022, according to leaked documents from Alabuga previously reported on by AP.",
      "In early 2023, Iran shipped about 600 disassembled drones to be reassembled in Russia before production was localized. In 2024, the design was adapted.",
      "Specialists added cameras to some drones and implemented a plan, revealed in an AP investigation, dubbed Operation False Target \u2014 creating decoys to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.",
      "Alabuga also modified the Shahed to make it more lethal, creating a thermobaric drone which sucks out all the oxygen in its path \u2014 potentially collapsing lungs, crushing eyeballs and causing brain damage. The size of the warhead was also upgraded.",
      "In at least one case, Iran shipped a jet-powered Shahed that Russia \u201cexperimented\u201d with in Ukraine, said Fabian Hinz, an expert on Russian and Iranian drones at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force found two more examples of jet-powered Shaheds in May but it appears they have not been widely adopted.",
      "That\u2019s possibly because the Iranian design uses a very sophisticated jet engine that also powers Iran\u2019s cruise missiles, Hinz said. That likely makes it too expensive to use nightly in Ukraine, he said, even if the engine is swapped to a cheaper Chinese model.",
      "The electronics in the drone most recently found in Ukraine are also very expensive, Beskrestnov said, pointing to its AI computing platform, camera and radio link. It\u2019s unclear why it was deployed but Beskrestnov suggested it could be used to target \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d including electrical transmission towers.",
      "Previous versions of the Shahed drone could not hit a moving object or change their flight path once launched. They sometimes ended up \u201ctraveling in circles all through Ukraine before they finally hit a target,\u201d which made them easier to shoot down, said David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security.",
      "The radio link means an operator can communicate with the drone from Russia, introduce a new target and potentially control many drones at the same time, the experts said.",
      "The remotely operable Shahed has similarities to drones Russia is already using on the front lines and is particularly resistant to jamming, Beskrestnov said.",
      "There are eight, rather than four, antennas on the drone which means it is harder for Ukraine to overwhelm it with electronic warfare, he said.",
      "The new drone has markings that suggest the anti-jamming unit was made in Iran within the past year and similarities to Iranian components found in older models of the Shahed, said Beskrestnov.",
      "Such advanced antennas, said Hinz, have not previously been seen on drones used in Ukraine but have been found on Iranian missiles destined for Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "In a statement, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense told AP in the past four months it had found drones with eight and 12 antennas made in China and Russia.",
      "Despite sanctions, both Russia and Iran have continued to find ways to procure Western technology.",
      "The drone\u2019s AI computing platform can help it autonomously navigate if communications are jammed. Similar technology was used by Ukraine to attack aircraft deep inside Russia during Operation Spiderweb, when it used drones to target Russian air bases hosting nuclear-capable strategic bombers.",
      "Russia is improving its technology at the same time as it is also changing its tactics.",
      "Moscow is flying the Shahed drones at high altitudes where they are out of reach of Ukrainian shooters, as well as lower down to avoid radio detection.",
      "It is also carrying out massive group attacks on cities including where drones sometimes dive-bomb a target, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said.",
      "The drones can be used to clear a path for cruise missiles or to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses by sending a wave of decoys followed by one or two with a warhead.",
      "The tactics appear to be working.",
      "AP collected almost a year\u2019s worth of Russian drone strike data on Ukraine posted online by the Ukrainian air force.",
      "An analysis shows that Russia significantly ramped up its attacks after U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January. And Russian hits have increased markedly since March \u2014 shortly before reports emerged that Russia was using Shahed drones with advanced jammers.",
      "In November 2024, only around 6% of drones hit a discernible target but, by June, that reached about 16%. On some nights, almost 50% of drones got through Ukraine\u2019s air defenses.",
      "Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said the Shaheds' effectiveness is likely because Russia is firing more drones, including decoys, as well as the change in technology and tactics.",
      "But although Russia appears to have had increasing success striking Ukraine, it is not clear if that will continue.",

      "While it lacks the technical abilities of China or Russia, Iran has long been known as a \u201cchaos agent\u201d when it comes to using cyberattacks to steal secrets, score political points or frighten opponents.",
      "Cyberattacks mounted by Iran's government may end if the ceasefire holds and Tehran looks to avoid another confrontation with the U.S. But hacker groups could still retaliate on Iran's behalf.",
      "In some cases, these groups have ties to military or intelligence agencies. In other cases, they act entirely independently. More than 60 such groups have been identified by researchers at the security firm Trustwave.",
      "These hackers can inflict significant economic and psychological blows. Following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, for instance, hackers penetrated an emergency alert app used by some Israelis and directed it to inform users that a nuclear missile was incoming.",
      "\u201cIt causes an immediate psychological impact,\" said Ziv Mador, vice president of security research at Trustwave's SpiderLabs, which tracks cyberthreats.",
      "Economic disruption, confusion and fear are all the goals of such operations, said Mador, who is based in Israel. \u201cWe saw the same thing in Russia-Ukraine.\u201d",
      "While Iran lacks the cyberwarfare capabilities of China or Russia, it has repeatedly tried to use its more modest operations to try to spy on foreign leaders \u2014 something national security experts predict Tehran is almost certain to try again as it seeks to suss out President Donald Trump\u2019s next moves.",
      "Last year, federal authorities charged three Iranian operatives with trying to hack Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. It would be wrong to assume Iran has given up those efforts, according to Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency cybersecurity expert who is now vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy, a Washington-based cybersecurity firm.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fairly certain that these limited resources are being used for intelligence collection to understand what Israel or the U.S. might be planning next, rather than performing destructive attacks against U.S. commercial organizations,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Calls to bolster America's digital defense come as the Trump administration has moved to slash some cybersecurity programs as part of its effort to shrink the size of government.",
      "CISA has placed staffers who worked on election security on leave and cut millions of dollars in funding for cybersecurity programs for local and state elections.",
      "The CIA, NSA and other intelligence agencies also have seen reductions in staffing. Trump abruptly fired Gen. Timothy Haugh, who oversaw the NSA and the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command.",
      "The Israel-Iran conflict shows the value of investments in cybersecurity and cyber offense, Mador said. He said Israel's strikes on Iran, which included attacks on nuclear scientists, required sophisticated cyberespionage that allowed Israel to track its targets.",
      "Expanding America's cyber defenses will require investments in education as well as technical fixes to ensure connected devices or networks aren't vulnerable, said Bellini, who recently contributed $40 million toward a new cybersecurity center at the University of South Florida.",
      "There is a new arms race when it comes to cyberwar, Bellini said, and it's a contest America can't afford to lose.",
      "\u201cIt's Wile E. Coyote vs. the Road Runner,\u201d Bellini said. \"It will go back and forth, and it will never end.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- It is often said music is the universal language of humanity. Now a 12-year-old Houston boy is putting that to the test among an unlikely audience \u2014 man's best friend.",
      "Yuvi Agarwal started playing keyboard when he was 4 and several years ago noticed his playing soothed his family's restless golden doodle, Bozo. He grew curious if it also could help stressed homeless animals.",
      "With help from his parents, who both have backgrounds in marketing, he founded the nonprofit Wild Tunes in 2023 to recruit musicians to play in animal shelters. So far he has enlisted about 100 volunteer musicians and singers of all ages and abilities to perform at nine shelters in Houston, New Jersey and Denver.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand the lyrics to enjoy the music. Just enjoy the melody, the harmony and the rhythms. So it transcends linguistic barriers, and even it can just transcend species,\u201d Agarwal said recently after playing hits like The Beatles' \u201cHey Jude\u201d and Ed Sheeran's \u201cPerfect\u201d on his portable keyboard at the Denver Animal Shelter.",
      "Agarwal, who was playing for an elderly miniature poodle named Pituca \u2014 Spanish slang sometimes used to describe a snob \u2014 said many of his four-legged listeners, which include cats, become excited when he enters their kennel. But after a few minutes of playing, they calm down. Some even go to sleep.",
      "He remembers a rescue dog named Penelope that refused to come out of her enclosure in Houston to be fed.",
      "\u201cWithin a short period of me playing, she went from not even coming out of her kennel to licking me all over my face and nibbling my ears,\u201d Agarwal said.",
      "A few stalls down from where he was jamming on his keyboard at the Denver shelter, volunteer Sarah McDonner played Mozart and Bach on her flute for Max, a 1-year-old stray boxer that tilted his head when she hit the high notes.",
      "\u201cThe animals having that human interaction in a positive way, I think, gives them something to look forward to, something that is different throughout their day,\u201d said McDonner, a professional musician who met Argawal in Houston.",
      "She helped bring the program to Colorado after moving to Denver a few months ago. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to give them something different from what they\u2019re used to in their little tiny cages ... and makes them more adoptable in the long run,\u201d McDonner said.",
      "While the effect of music on humans has been studied extensively, its role in animal behavior remains murky.",
      "Several studies suggest that classical music generally has a calming influence on dogs in stressful environments like kennels, shelters and veterinary clinics. But some researchers warn there is not enough data to support the claim.",
      "\u201cWe always want these really simplistic answers. So we want to say that music calms animals, for example, and I think that it\u2019s much more nuanced than that,\u201d said Lori Kogan, a self-described \u201cdog-person\" who chairs the human-animal interaction section of the American Psychological Association. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more research that needs to happen before I think that we can unequivocally say that music is a great thing for animals.\"",
      "Kogan, a professor and researcher at Colorado State University, has studied for more than two decades how animals and humans get along. Research involving the effect of music on dogs often produces mixed results, she said, because there are so many variables: the setting; the volume, type and tempo of the music and the breed of the dog and its previous exposure to music.",
      "She suggests a case-by-case approach to introducing music to animals.",
      "\u201cIf you play music for your pet, and they seem to like it and they appear calmer, then I think we can say that that\u2019s a positive thing, that you\u2019re providing some level of enrichment for that pet. ... I would encourage people to give it a try and to see how their pets respond,\u201d she said.",
      "For Agarwal, his firsthand experience at shelters is undeniable evidence that music helps comfort stressed animals, and he plans to grow Wild Tunes into a nationwide program. The volunteers get something out of it, too, he said.",
      "\"You get a really great way to practice your instrument or sing in front of a nonjudgmental audience, which can boost your confidence,\u201d he said.",

      "Defense tech hackathons are attracting engineering students, tech industry workers and hobbyists to solve military challenges",
      "SANDHURST, England -- Hunched over laptops, the team of four raced to solve a challenge: how to get a set of drones to fly themselves from one place to another when GPS and other signals are jammed by an enemy.",
      "Elsewhere around the hall, groups of people \u2014 engineering students, tech workers and hobbyists \u2014 gathered around long tables to brainstorm, write computer code or tinker with more drones and other hardware.",
      "Most of them were strangers when they first gathered last month at Britain's Sandhurst Military Academy to compete in a 24-hour \u201chackathon\" focused on defense technology. Many were drawn to the event because they wanted to use their technical skills to work on one of the biggest challenges confronting Europe: the continent's race to beef up its military capabilities as Russia's war in Ukraine threatens to widen global instability.",
      "\u201cGiven the geopolitical climate, defense tech is relevant now more than ever,\u201d said Aniketh Ramesh, a startup founder with a Ph.D. in robotics in extreme environments and one of the drone team members. The hackathon, he said, \u201cis a good place to sort of go and contribute your ideas.\u201d",
      "\u201cRobotics and drones are having their iPhone moment\" because costs have come down and the hardware is widely available, Ramesh said. That means building drones to do new things is more a \u201cthinking challenge\" than a technical one, he said.",
      "Ramesh already knew one teammate, a former British army paratrooper, from a previous event. They recruited two others \u2014 one engineer and one with a Ph.D. in computer vision \u2014 through the event\u2019s group chat on Signal.",
      "The drone problem was just one of the many challenges the teams could choose to solve. The tasks were proposed by defense startups like German drone maker Helsing and robotics company Arx, the British military and Kyiv-based venture capital firm D3.",
      "Some worked on software, such as an algorithm to predict which way a target would move. Others came with their own ideas. One team made a plastic cup packed with sensors that could be produced in large amounts to be scattered across a battlefield. Another team built a scale model of an autonomous medical evacuation aircraft.",
      "Similar competitions have been held regularly across Europe since last year, inspired by the Ukrainian military\u2019s on-the-fly wartime innovations to fend off the larger Russian army.",
      "The grassroots meetups are part of a wider network of defense innovation that organizers hope to foster in Europe, underscoring the continent's scramble to churn out weapons that have been turbocharged by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s persistent threats to withdraw from the NATO trans-Atlantic security alliance.",
      "The idea is to \u201cgo build a prototype, take your prototype to become a product, and go build a company\u201d that can \u201cdeliver stuff to the frontline and hopefully save someone\u2019s life,\u201d said Benjamin Wolba, who organizes a separate but similar series, the European Defense Tech Hackathon.",
      "Wolba's group has held tournaments in about 10 cities in the past twelve months, including one in Lviv, Ukraine, in May, and has scheduled more this year in Sheffield, England; Gothenburg, Sweden; Marseilles, France; London; and Berlin.",
      "The European Union-backed EUDIS Defence Hackathon holds simultaneous competitions at eight universities twice a year. Meanwhile, NATO has launched DIANA, an \u201caccelerator\u201d program to speed up defense innovations.",
      "The competitions are producing real-world results. The winners of one European Defense Tech Hackathon were a team of Bulgarian high school students who came up with a de-mining solution that they used to found a startup.",
      "At last year\u2019s London event, the winning team devised an idea for an anti-drone system. They went to Ukraine for more testing, and then were bought by a startup that went on to raise millions in venture capital funding, said Richard Pass, co-founder of the London hackathon.",
      "This year, instead of a trophy, some London teams signed term sheets with investors.",
      "Hackathons have their origins in the software industry. Small teams of programmers and developers are pitted against each other in marathon brainstorming sessions to write programs that could become new products.",
      "\u201cThe beauty of the hackathon is you get a mixture of people who never normally meet,\u201d said Wolba. \u201cEngineers are \u201cpaired with actual investors who understand something on the commercial side, but also, critically, military end users.\u201d",
      "Organizers want to foster a culture of nimble startups to join Europe's defense ecosystem, traditionally dominated by a handful of big \u201cprime\u201d military contractors such as Britain's BAE, Germany's Rheinmetall and France's Thales that are focused on building pricey hardware.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a shift in the industry from the purchase of more exquisite, high-cost capabilities, such as fighter jets, or submarines, or expensive tanks, towards more low-cost systems that can give you scale advantages,\u201d said Pass.",
      "A recent aerial confrontation between Pakistan and India further highlights how Europe is at risk of losing its edge against adversaries, he said.",
      "Pass said reports that Pakistan used Chinese-made fighter jets armed with Chinese air-to-air missiles to down Indian air force planes, including three French-made Rafale jets, came as a big surprise.",
      "Not only does it show \u201ctechnological parity between the Chinese and leading Western industrial nations like France,\u201d but it also hints at China's advantages in mass-producing fighter jets that could overwhelm Western forces, he said.",
      "Fostering a broader European defense tech start-up ecosystem is a way \u201cto regain that technological advantage,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense tech startup founders can ride a wave of investment as Europe moves to beef up its military capabilities. Leaders of NATO, which includes 30 European nations, are meeting this week to endorse a goal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense.",
      "The European Union has sought to mobilize 800 billion euros ($927 billion) to boost the 27-nation bloc's defense, with priorities including drones, AI, autonomous systems and quantum computing.",
      "Britain, which left the EU, has meanwhile pledged to spend 10% of its defense budget on new technologies.",
      "Europe still has a long way to go. The continent's defense tech startup ecosystem is young and about five years behind the United States, consulting firm McKinsey said in a recent report. But it's growing rapidly as investors flock there. Venture capital investment in Europe's defense tech sector for 2021-2024 more than quadrupled from the previous three-year period, according to Pitchbook.",
      "At the London hackathon, teams worked into the evening, fueled by chocolate bars, energy drinks, fruit and a late-night pizza delivery. Army cots were available for those who wanted to catch a few hours of sleep.",
      "Soldiers in camouflage and defense company reps hovered on the sidelines to provide advice and answer questions.",
      "Andrii Solonskyi, CEO of Soloma Avionics, which fielded a team, said defense hackathons are \u201ca bit of a novelty.\u201d",
      "The industry has traditionally been more structured and formal, because \u201cit\u2019s a serious business and there\u2019s a lot of things that can go wrong,\u201d he said. But, \"what we definitely feel is that you can be very agile in defense right now.\"",

      "Prosecutors said in the letter to families that the state was approached last week by Kohberger's defense team asking to be presented with an offer. Prosecutors said they then met with available family members last week, \"weighed the right path forward and made a formal offer\" to Kohberger.",
      "\"This resolution is our sincere attempt to seek justice for your family,\" prosecutors wrote in the letter. \"This agreement ensures that the defendant will be convicted, will spend the rest of his life in prison, and will not be able to put you and the other families through the uncertainty of decades of post-conviction, appeals.

      "Fifty-five percent of voters said that they oppose the bill, while 29% said they support it and 16% were unsure. Among Republicans, 67% said they support the act while a larger 87% of Democrats oppose it.",
      "The bill would impose new work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients who don't have dependents. Asked about how they feel about the Medicaid provisions, voters were largely split \u2013 47% of registered voters said they support them and 46% said they oppose them, effectively a dead heat.",
      "A separate poll of registered voters from Fox News taken in mid-June found similar results. 59% of registered voters said they oppose the bill, while 38% of them favored it. (However, around 4 in 10 voters said they don't understand the bill very much or at all.)",
      "A smaller plurality of voters \u2013 49% \u2013 told Fox News they think the legislation will hurt their families, while 23% said it would help and 26% said it would make no difference.",
      "Meanwhile, a poll of American adults taken in early June by the Washington Post and Ipsos found a plurality of adults, 42%, opposing the bill, and 23% supportive of it. But at that time, 34% of American adults said they had no opinion about it, and separately, 66% said they had heard only a little or nothing at all about the bill.",
      "However, 49% of Americans told the Washington Post and Ipsos back then that they would support extending the tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a provision of the bill -- although their support spiked to 71% when asked if they'd support or oppose those tax cuts for people who have incomes lower than $100,000, and dropped underwater when asked about individuals with incomes above $400,000 or business corporations.",
      "The Pew Research Center, in an early June poll, also found around half \u2013 49% \u2013 of Americans opposing the bill and 29% supporting it. Separately, 54% of Americans also felt the bill would have a \"mostly negative effect on the country,\" while 3 in 10 felt it would have a \"mostly positive effect.\"",
      "But similar to the Washington Post's poll, Pew found that around half of Americans would favor creating work requirements for Medicaid, with 32% opposed.",
      "A provision on money for border security enforcement \u2013 which Pew framed as increased funding for detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants \u2013 split American adults. 45% said they are opposed and 41% said they favor.",
      "The nonprofit health policy research group KFF, meanwhile, found in an early June poll that a larger majority of American adults, 64%, had an unfavorable view of the bill, while 35% had a favorable view of it. Only 17% of respondents felt that the bill would help them and their families, and 44% said it would hurt, although almost 1 in 4 did not think it would make much difference.",
      "The poll separately found a lot of support for Medicaid more generally as a program, with 79% of Americans saying they think it is the government's responsibility \"to provide health insurance coverage to low-income Americans who cannot afford it.\"",

      "Experts say work requirements might force people off Medicaid.",
      "As Republicans work to pass President Donald Trump's reconciliation bill by his July 4 deadline, many are worried about the changes that could be coming to Medicaid.",
      "Medicaid is a joint federal and state health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services works with state programs to administer Medicaid, which enrolls more than 71.2 million people.",
      "The original measure passed by the House made around $600 billion in cuts to Medicaid, which then faced deeper cuts in the Senate.",
      "New estimates from the Congressional Budget Office project federal spending on Medicaid will be reduced by $1 trillion and that the current version of the bill in the Senate would increase the number of uninsured by 11.8 million by 2034.",
      "The passage of the bill would go against Trump's repeated promises to keep Medicaid intact.",
      "Health policy experts and health care workers say sharp Medicaid cuts could result in vulnerable Americans no longer being able to receive care, either by losing coverage or by closing the centers that provide such care.",
      "Work requirements could result in lost coverage",
      "The bill imposes new 80-hour per month work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients aged 19 to 64 who don't have dependents. These requirements include working or other approved activities, such as volunteering.",
      "There are exemptions for parents or guardians of children under age 14 and those with disabilities. Under the bill's current text, these work requirements won't kick in until 2026.",
      "An analysis published last week from the UC Berkley Labor Center found that work requirements could have a devastating impact on older Americans, between ages 50 and 64.",
      "Nari Rhee, director of the Retirement Security Program at the UC Berkeley Labor Center and author of the analysis, told ABC News that after age 50, employment becomes increasingly difficult.",
      "For instance, many older workers become physically unable to continue employment until they reach retirement age.",
      "\"Most people hope and plan to retire at something like age 65, but life happens and quite often what happens is people start having health issues,\" Rhee said. \"If you've had blue collar work or manual work, often you started working probably in your late teens. And so, by the time you get into your 50s, your late 50s, your body is just really worn out, and you're not no longer able to work the kinds of jobs that you used to do.\"",
      "She added that some older workers who are physically unable to do the jobs they used to do or who were laid off have a hard time finding employment again due to age discrimination.",
      "Additionally, many older adults are responsible for caring for family members including spouses and parents, which may mean leaving the workplace entirely.",
      "\"In practical terms, there are all kinds of legitimate reasons why, especially older adults, might not be able to meet the work requirements in terms of actually putting in the number of hours, and that's before we even get to all the administrative issues,\" Rhee said. \"Even if you do work, you might not be able to navigate the red tape.\"",
      "AARP, an interest group that focusing on issues affecting those 50 and older in the U.S., sent a letter over the weekend to Sen. Majority Leader John Thune and Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressing opposition to a provision that would disqualify people who fail to meet Medicaid work requirements from receiving Affordable Care Act premium tax credits.",
      "\"This creates a steep coverage cliff for those in their 50s and early 60s -- particularly for those nearing retirement or working part-time -- who may be left with no affordable coverage option at all.\"",
      "Risk of rural hospitals, health centers closing",
      "Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurse Association, said cuts to Medicaid could force rural hospitals and community health centers to close.",
      "Although Senate Republicans have proposed a $25 billion rural health stabilization fund due to cuts to the Medicaid provider tax, it is unclear if that will be enough to prevent hospitals from closing.",
      "Many rural health care centers receive revenue from patients covered by Medicaid and losing that revenue could be costly.",
      "\"These hospitals have been on the verge of tight finances for years, and this could be enough to shut them down,\" Mensik Kennedy told ABC News. \"If we have cuts to Medicaid, we're going to see these hospitals start to shutter their doors, and people are going to have to drive three, four, hours to deliver a baby, to go have emergency care to get seen, and that's got to be unacceptable to everyone.\"",
      "Arnulfo De La Cruz, president of SEIU 2015, the nation's largest long-term care union and California's largest labor union, concurred, saying cuts to Medicaid would impact states' ability to provide health coverage and long-term care, particularly for rural and low-income Americans.",
      "\"Any cuts to Medicaid, the impact in California would be devastating \u2026 Medicaid is really the core of how the long-term care system is structured and funded,\" he told ABC News. \"Medicaid helps to fund clinics, hospitals, nursing homes, home care -- it's all connected as part of our health delivery system. If you were to dismantle or cut to the extent that they're talking about, I think you see clinics close, you see hospitals close, you see nursing homes close.\"",
      "He went on, \"I think it would have a devastating impact on the ability for rural Californians and low-income Californians to be able to access their health care, thereby becoming sicker and having to look to much more high-cost alternatives.\"",

Tillis then suddenly announced he would not seek reelection, saying later he texted Trump on Saturday night suggesting he \"probably needed to start looking for a replacement.\"",
      "\"I respect President Trump. I support the majority of his agenda, but I don't bow to anybody. When the people of North Carolina are at risk. And this bill puts them at risk,\" Tillis said.",
      "What's next for OBBB in the House?",

      "\"Members are advised that votes are now expected in the House as early as 9 a.m. Wednesday, July 2. Please stay tuned to future updates for additional information regarding this week's schedule,\" a notice from Majority Whip Tom Emmer's office said.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson expressed optimism that the Senate\u2019s version of the One Big Beautiful Bill will pass in the GOP-led House despite opposition from moderates and conservatives.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to pass this bill one way or the other,\u201d Johnson said leaving the Capitol Monday evening. \u201cAnd I have prevailed upon my Senate colleagues to please, please, please, put it as close to the House product as possible. I have been very consistent from the very beginning.",
      "Johnson did not rule out passing the Senate version as is and said, \u201cthere\u2019s still a lot of amendments, and a lot of game to play.\u201d",
      "Asked if GOP House leaders would make changes to what the Senate sends over, Johnson said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what the final product is. I am very hopeful as always. We will get this job done. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d",
      "The speaker did not respond to a question about passing the bill by the Fourth of July deadline.",
      "Republican leaders have told members they will receive 48 hours notice before a vote is called and will have 72 hours to review the bill text.",
      "The House passed the Trump megabill by just one vote back in May. The Senate version of the bill will face an uphill battle in the House, given the GOP's razor-thin majority.",
      "California moderate Republican Rep. David Valadao said he will vote no given the Medicaid changes in the Senate bill. Several conservatives, including Reps. Chip Roy of Texas, Josh Breechen of Oklahoma and Eric Burlison of Missouri have also expressed opposition to the Senate's version of the bill.",
      "Johnson and other Republican leaders worked through the weekend to lock down the votes even as several lawmakers have expressed opposition to the Senate's version, which is still not finalized. Johnson can only afford to lose three defections if all members are voting and present.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Trump was working \"hand in hand\" with Johnson and Thune, and that the two leaders had met with him at the White House earlier Monday.",
      "\"Republicans need to stay tough and unified during the home stretch, and we are counting on them to get the job done,\" Leavitt said during the White House briefing.",
      "But sources familiar with the matter told ABC News Thune and Johnson have not met with President Trump at the White House, and as of now the two leaders have no current plans to meet with the president on Monday as the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" progresses in the Senate.",
      "A spokesman for Thune said he is preoccupied as the Senate moves through amendments to the megabill.",
      "\"Teams are obviously in close contact/coordination, as always, but we're continuing to move through vote-a-rama in the Senate as we work to move this bill one step closer to the president's desk,\" the spokesman said in a post on X.",

      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said many Republicans agree with Tillis.",
      "GOP Sen. Thom Tillis was back on Capitol Hill on Monday as Senate Republicans struggled to pass their \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" he opposes -- before President Donald Trump's July Fourth deadline.",
      "\"I may look for an opportunity to speak again,\" Tillis said during his fiery remarks on the Senate floor on Sunday night, in which he urged his Republican colleagues to reconsider their support for the GOP tax bill, which he said \"breaks\" President Donald Trump's promises to protect Medicaid.",
      "But on Monday it remained unclear whether any of his fellow Republicans would go along.",
      "Monday morning, as lawmakers began another long day of debate, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer lauded Tillis for his remarks calling out the GOP megabill's provisions he said would slash Medicaid in his home state of North Carolina.",
      "\"I salute my colleague from North Carolina. We all heard what our colleague from North Carolina had to say yesterday about this bill. My guess is about half -- maybe more than half of the Republicans in the Senate agree with him. But he had the courage to speak the truth,\" Schumer on Monday morning, as a vote-a-rama on the bill began.",
      "\"He said it himself: the bill devastates his state but make no mistake about it, it will devastate the states of almost every Republican here,\" Schumer added.",
      "But how Tillis will navigate the rest of his term in the Senate -- and perhaps the rest of the reconciliation bill's consideration -- remains to be seen -- after he abruptly announced he wouldn't run for reelection when Trump threatened to support a GOP primary challenger.",
      "While his speech railing against the measure's Medicaid cuts displayed some of the \"pure freedom\" he noted in his retirement announcement \"to call the balls and strikes as I see fit,\" Tillis also told reporters at the Capitol on Sunday that he would never do anything to \"undermine\" or \"surprise\" the Senate Republican Conference.",
      "\"Look, here's the thing, I was a leader. I'm never going to do anything to undermine my conference, and I'm never going to surprise my conference,\" Tillis said..",
      "\"I let Senator Thune last night know that I intended to do this today. I'm not that kind of guy. I mean, if you've got a surprise or jam your conference to get something done, you're a pretty shitty legislator, and that's just not my style,\" he went on.",
      "\"So, I'm going to stand behind John and the leadership and do everything I can to make them successful,\" Tillis said.",
      "In his speech to \"explain\" his vote Saturday against the motion to move forward on the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" he condemned the legislation.",
      "\"What do I tell 663,000 people in two years, three years, when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding is not there anymore, guys?\" Tillis asked at one point.",
      "\"The people in the White House advising the president, they're not telling him that the effect of this bill is to break a promise.\"",
      "He said blasted the president's self-imposed July 4th deadline to pass the legislation as \"artificial.\"",
      "\"I believe that we can make sure that we do not break the promise of Donald J. Trump -- that he's made to the people on Medicaid today,\" Tillis went on. \"But what we're doing because we've got a view on an artificial deadline on July 4 that means nothing but another date and time we could take the time to get this right, if we lay down the house mark of the Medicaid bill and fix it.\"",
      "\"What's wrong with actually understanding what this bill does?\" he said.",
      "Tillis laid out how he'd done the work of understanding the bill over recent weeks, talking with leaders in North Carolina and members of the Trump administration about the impacts of the legislation's Medicaid provisions on his state.",
      "He said administration officials could not disprove his findings that there would be about a $26 billion cut in Medicaid across North Carolina as a result of the bill.",
      "Tillis said he started his fact-finding process by asking Republican staff in the North Carolina legislature, members of Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's team and to the non-partisan Hospital Association for their estimates about this bill's cuts to Medicaid in North Carolina.",
      "\"I asked three different independent groups: a partisan Democrat group, a partisan Republican group of experts, and a nonpartisan group of the Hospital Association to develop an intact assessment, independent, not talking, not sharing, reporting to me, and what I found is the best case scenario is about a $26 billion cut,\" Tillis said.",
      "He said when he presented those findings to the Trump administration, they were rejected.",
      "\"I had people in the administration say, you're all wet, you don't know what you're doing,\" he said.",
      "Tillis concluded by saying that the Senate \"owes it to the American people\" to withhold advancement of the bill \" until it's demonstrated to me that we've done our homework.\"",
      "\"We're going to make sure that we fulfill the promise And then we can feel -- I can feel -- good about a bill that I'm willing to vote for, but until that time, I will be withholding my vote,\" Tillis said.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration argues that Tren de Aragua is invading the U.S.",
      "A panel of judges at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the country's more conservative courts, heard arguments Monday over whether the Trump administration can invoke the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants it considers to be part of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang.",
      "\"This has been invoked three times only in major, major wars,\" argued ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt regarding the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th century wartime authority used to remove noncitizens with little-to-no due process. \"The government is now suggesting you can invoke it with a gang.\"",
      "The Trump administration touched off a legal battle in March when it invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport two planeloads of alleged migrant gang members to the CECOT mega-prison in El Salvador by arguing that Tren de Aragua is a \"hybrid criminal state\" that is invading the United States.",
      "In the multiple lawsuits the ACLU has helped bring against Trump's use of the AEA, the group has argued that the administration failed to prove that the presence of Tren de Aragua members amounts to a \"predatory incursion\" or a declared war as the text of the AEA outlines.",
      "\"This was solely about war and serious military conflict at a size where we would respond with our military, and no one's suggesting that the military has or would respond here,\" Gelernt argued during Monday's hearing.",
      "The judges, however, seemed most concerned about whether or not they had the power to rule against a president's invocation of the act.",
      "\"Can you give me a Supreme Court case where the Supreme Court has said you can, as a federal court, countermand the president of the United States in his determination that we're in an armed conflict?\" one of the judges asked.",
      "Gelernt replied that he could not point to a specific case, but argued that if the court were to declare that the AEA requires a military conflict, \"it would have to be able to take action to say, 'Well, does the proclamation on its face set forth a military conflict?'\"",
      "\"The government itself is not claiming there's a military conflict,\" he said.",
      "Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign argued that the court did not have the power to second guess the president's authority to invoke the act.",
      "Ensign also claimed that Tren de Aragua had taken over \"entire apartment buildings in which they exercise control\" in areas across the country, and that the FBI had reason to believe that the gang would carry out assassinations in the United States.",
      "\"The FBI has assessed that it's likely the TdA will try to carry out targeted assassinations of the Maduro regime in the next six to 18 months, as indeed, they have done in Chile -- they kidnapped and murdered a former Venezuelan army colonel who was a critic of the Maduro regime and had asylum in Chile,\" said Ensign.",
      "\"So we think all of that evidence clearly supports the president's determination that an invasion and predatory incursion has occurred,\" Ensign said.",

      "The home of the world's premier film festival is joining a growing global backlash against overtourism, which recently saw uproar over Jeff Bezos\u2019 and Lauren Sanchez' Venice wedding this weekend, water-gun protests in Spain and a surprise strike at the Louvre Museum.",
      "\u201cLess numerous, less big, less polluting and more esthetic\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s the aim of Cannes city councilors who voted Friday to introduce new limits on cruise ships in its ports starting Jan. 1. Only ships with fewer than 1,000 passengers will be allowed in the port, with a maximum of 6,000 passengers disembarking per day. Larger ships will be expected to transfer passengers to smaller boats to enter Cannes.",
      "France \u2014 which drew in some 100 million visitors last year, more than any other European country and more than the country\u2019s population \u2014 is on the front line of efforts to balance economic benefits of tourism with environmental concerns while managing ever-growing crowds.",
      "\u201cCannes has become a major cruise ship destination, with real economic benefits. It\u2019s not about banning cruise ships, but about regulating, organizing, setting guidelines for their navigation,\u201d Mayor David Lisnard said in a statement.",

      "Two cruise ships were scheduled to dock in Cannes on Sunday, each bigger than the upcoming 1,000-passenger limit and with a combined capacity of more than 7,000 people. Their owners did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new restrictions.",

      "Group and solo travelers are trickling into Afghanistan by plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles",
      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- By plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles, tourists are beginning to discover Afghanistan, with solo travelers and tour groups gradually venturing into a country that until recently was wracked by war.",
      "And the country\u2019s Taliban government, which seized power more than three years ago but has yet to be formally recognized by any other nation, is more than happy to welcome them.",
      "\u201cThe Afghan people are warm and welcoming and wish to host tourists from other countries and engage with them,\u201d Deputy Minister of Tourism Qudratullah Jamal told The Associated Press in an early June interview. \u201cTourism brings many benefits to a country. We have considered those benefits and aim for our nation to take full advantage of them.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a vital, multi-billion-dollar industry for many countries.",
      "Afghanistan\u2019s isolation on the international stage, largely because of the Taliban\u2019s restrictions on women and girls, has left much of its 41 million people mired in poverty. As it struggles to attract foreign investment, the lucrative potential of tourism is far from lost on the government.",
      "\u201cWe are currently earning a considerable amount of revenue from this industry, and we are hopeful it will grow even more in the future,\u201d Jamal said, noting money spent by visitors can reach more layers of society than revenue from other industries. \u201cWe are optimistic this sector will evolve into a large economy, bringing significant benefits. It plays an important role in strengthening our national economy.\u201d",
      "Tourist visas are quick and easy to obtain and flights from major transit hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul operate several times a week. The government has even set up a training institute for men \u2014 and it is only for men \u2014 seeking jobs in the hospitality and tourism sector.",
      "While visitor numbers are still very much a trickle rather than a flood, they are increasing. Nearly 9,000 foreign tourists visited Afghanistan last year, while nearly 3,000 people visited in the first three months of this year, Jamal said.",
      "Four decades of near-continuous conflict kept nearly all vacationers away from this landlocked country of towering mountains, deep gorges and millennia of history.",
      "The Taliban\u2019s takeover from a U.S.-backed government in August 2021 stunned the world and sent thousands of Afghans fleeing. But with the insurgency over, the bloodshed from frequent bombings and suicide attacks all but ended too.",
      "Attacks still occur, however. An Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan remains active and gunmen killed six people, including three Spanish tourists, in a May 2024 attack in Bamiyan, one of the country\u2019s main tourist attractions where centuries-old giant Buddhas carved into the cliffs were blown up by the Taliban in 2001.",
      "While Western countries still advise against travel to Afghanistan, a drop in violence from the two decades of U.S.-led military presence is indisputable, as the government is keen to point out.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan has gone through many years of war and hardship. Now, we want tourists to come and see the true traditions and customs of Afghans, to understand Afghan life, creativity and resilience,\u201d Jamal said, noting there was \u201ccomprehensive security across Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Critics question the ethics of foreigners visiting Afghanistan for pleasure when its government discriminates so heavily against half the country\u2019s population.",
      "Education beyond primary school level is banned for girls and women and few professions are open to them. Women cannot enter parks, gardens or gyms.",
      "Beauty salons are forbidden. Authorities dictate how women dress and have demanded they cover their faces in public, a decree still flouted by many, particularly in Kabul.",
      "Some visitors say they contemplated the ethics, but ultimately wanted to see the situation for themselves.",
      "French-Peruvian Illary Gomez said she and her British partner, James Liddiard, debated for about a year whether to drive through Afghanistan as part of their U.K.-to-Japan camper van journey.",
      "\u201cSome things didn\u2019t feel morally right,\u201d she said.",
      "But once here, they said they found a warm, hospitable and welcoming people and beautiful landscapes. They didn\u2019t feel their presence was any form of support for the Taliban.",
      "By traveling, \u201cyou put money in the hands of the people, not the government,\u201d Liddiard said.",
      "The treatment of women is particularly sensitive for government officials. Jamal declined to comment on the subject beyond saying male and female visitors were welcome.",
      "\u201cThose who respect our laws and traditions have already come and can continue to come,\u201d he said.",
      "While most restrictions are strictly enforced on Afghan women, they are far more relaxed for foreigners. Although they must still wear a headscarf in public, foreign women are more likely to gain entry into some restricted areas such as parks and are rarely asked to cover their faces in public.",
      "Opening the country to foreign visitors was also a way of building bridges, Jamal said.",
      "\u201cIt is a great way to promote interaction between the people of different countries. It helps build international relations and is also beneficial for trade,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cWhen foreigners come here, Afghans also learn a lot from them. In addition to expanding commerce, tourism also helps foster mutual understanding, cultural exchange and strengthens talents as people learn from one another.\u201d",
      "A foreign traveler seeing the country with his own eyes \u201ccreates closeness, builds connections and fosters trust among people,\u201d Jamal said. \u201cThey will respect each other\u2019s culture and the distance between peoples will diminish.",
      "\u201cSo this is not just economic development; it also brings spiritual and political benefits,\u201d he said.",

      "The federal troops' domestic deployment raised multiple legal questions, including whether the administration would seek to employ emergency powers under the Insurrection Act to empower those forces to conduct law enforcement on U.S. soil, which they are not permitted to do except in rare circumstances. The Marines, however, are primarily assigned to protecting federal buildings.",
      "The Insurrection Act has not been used. But in at least one circumstance, Marines have temporarily detained civilians in Los Angeles.",
      "California has just entered peak wildfire season, and Newsom has warned that the Guard is now understaffed due to the Los Angeles protest deployment.",

      "Peter Zisopoulos, 37, was convicted in May of second-degree murder for killing Lt. Alison Russo-Elling, then 61, as she walked from her fire department station to a nearby store for food in 2022. She was remembered by mourners as a dedicated public servant who responded to the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.",
      "There\u2019s no indication that Zisopoulos knew Russo-Elling. His public defender lawyer has said that Zisopoulos \u201chas a past psychiatric history going back to 2018.\u201d The lawyer did not immediately respond to a message left with his office on Monday.",
      "Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz called the killing \u201cbrutal and senseless.\u201d",
      "Russo-Elling was months away from retirement when she died. She was promoted posthumously from EMS lieutenant to the rank of captain.",
      "\u201cToday, we are appreciative that her killer has been sentenced to the maximum punishment: 25 years to life. This sentencing speaks to the brutality of the crime, and though it won\u2019t bring her back, I pray it will finally give her family the closure they deserve,\u201d said Fire Commissioner Robert S. Tucker.",
      "Monday's sentencing came after the unrelated fatal shooting of two on-duty firefighters in Idaho over the weekend.",

      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed a new nearly $115 billion state budget into law",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the state's new budget of about $115 billion into law Monday, capping the end of a lengthy and combative legislative season that was largely defined by GOP infighting, despite the party's iron grip on Tallahassee.",
      "The signing came \u201cright at the buzzer,\" DeSantis said, just one day before the budget goes into effect. It took lawmakers 105 days to finalize the spending plan, during what was supposed to be a 60-day session.",
      "The budget comes in at about $4 billion less than the state's current adjusted budget, and is nearly $600 million less than the Legislature's proposed budget, after DeSantis used his line-item veto power to cut spending projects.",
      "\u201cI think what you see in the budget is an example of a very fiscally responsible state,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cWe\u2019re meeting the needs of the state of Florida that I think most people want us to be focusing on. We\u2019re not, you know, frittering it away.\u201d",
      "The new budget and a related tax cut package include a 2% raise for state workers and a 10% to 15% pay hike for state law enforcement, $1.3 billion a year in tax cuts for families and businesses, and $4 billion to fund scholarships to private and religious schools.",
      "Democrats supported the budget, but some criticized the spending on vouchers and tax cuts, arguing for more funding for public schools and programs that support low-income families.",
      "The second-term governor, who cannot run for reelection in 2026, held the bill signing event in The Villages, one of the world\u2019s largest retirement communities and a place long known as a conservative stronghold.",
      "DeSantis used the event to tout a slate of familiar talking points, railing against a self-described democratic socialist running for New York City mayor, while touting his own crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and his push to eliminate property taxes in the state, a change that voters would have to approve.",
      "The adoption of a tighter state budget comes as officials are grappling with the loss of federal coronavirus funding and as economists fret over Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars and a sweeping proposal to cut federal taxes and spending.",
      "Florida\u2019s legislative leaders have largely downplayed concerns about how Trump\u2019s aggressive and unpredictable economic policies could impact the state\u2019s coffers, but lawmakers are taking steps to set aside billions of dollars in reserves.",

      "State and federal prosecutors have charged more than 320 people in the largest coordinated takedown of health care fraud schemes in Justice Department history that uncovered nearly $15 million in false claims",
      "WASHINGTON -- State and federal prosecutors have charged more than 320 people and uncovered nearly $15 million in false claims in what they described Monday as the largest coordinated takedown of health care fraud schemes in Justice Department history.",
      "Law enforcement seized more than $245 million in cash, luxury vehicles, cryptocurrency, and other assets as prosecutors warned of a growing push by transnational criminal networks to exploit the U.S. health care system. As part of the sweeping crackdown, officials identified perpetrators based in Russia, Eastern Europe, Pakistan, and other countries.",
      "\u201cThese criminals didn\u2019t just steal someone else\u2019s money. They stole from you,\" Matthew Galeotti, who leads the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, told reporters Monday. \u201cEvery fraudulent claim, every fake billing, every kickback scheme represents money taken directly from the pockets of American taxpayers who fund these essential programs through their hard work and sacrifice.\"",
      "The alleged $14.6 billion in fraud is more than twice the previous record in the Justice Department\u2019s annual health care fraud crackdown. It includes nearly 190 federal cases and more than 90 state cases that have been charged or unsealed since June 9. Nearly 100 licensed medical professionals were charged, including 25 doctors, and the government reported $2.9 billion in actual losses.",
      "Among the cases is a $10 billion urinary catheter scheme that authorities say highlights the increasingly sophisticated methods used by transnational criminal organizations. Authorities say the group behind the scheme used foreign straw owners to secretly buy up dozens of medical supply companies and then used stolen identities and confidential health data to file fake Medicare claims.",
      "Nineteen defendants have been charged as part of that investigation \u2014 which authorities dubbed Operation Gold Rush \u2014 including four people arrested in Estonia and seven people arrested at U.S. airports and at the border with Mexico, prosecutors said. The scheme involved the stolen identities and personal information of more one million Americans, according to the Justice Department.",
      "\u201cIt's not done by small time operators,\" said Dr. Mehmet Oz, who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \u201cThese are organized syndicates who are designing to hurt America.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "No state may have more to lose than Georgia as Republicans in Congress look to gut federal subsidies that aid both the solar and electric vehicle industries",
      "CARTERSVILLE, Ga. -- When two South Korean companies announced a multibillion-dollar investment to build solar panel and electric battery factories in northwest Georgia, federal subsidies helped close a deal to diversify the local economy.",
      "The factories promised thousands of new jobs, transforming the manufacturing base in Cartersville, once a cotton mill town before an Anheuser-Busch brewery arrived in the 1990s and a tire plant in 2006.",
      "But now Republicans in Congress want to gut the subsidies for projects across the country in a tax cut bill likely days from final passage. President Donald Trump\u2019s signature legislation could harm Cartersville despite it being in overwhelmingly Republican Bartow County, which backed Trump with 75% of the vote all three times he appeared on the ballot.",
      "Both companies say they\u2019re continuing their buildout plans. But Steve Taylor, a Republican who is Bartow County's lone elected commissioner, says ending the tax credits would be \u201ca little concerning.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose companies came and it gave us a completely different type of industry and manufacturing for our community,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "By some measures, no state may have more to lose than Georgia from such cuts in Trump's \u201c Big Beautiful Bill.\u201d Top Georgia Republicans have been mostly silent, while Georgia\u2019s two Democratic U.S. senators are staunchly opposed.",
      "\u201cA vote for this bill is a vote against Georgia\u2019s economy and a vote that will put so much of what we\u2019ve worked so hard to achieve at risk\u201d U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff told The Associated Press.",
      "And few towns have more to lose than Cartersville, the Bartow County seat about 35 miles (55 kilometers) northwest of Atlanta. As the county transforms from rural to suburban, leaders foresee an economic boost from the $5 billion battery factory that Hyundai Motor Group and SK On are building, as well as the $2.3 billion solar panel plant belonging to Qcells, a unit of Hanwha Solutions. Both plants pledge to pay workers an average of $53,000 a year.",
      "Georgia\u2019s huge inrush of clean energy projects had already begun before 2022, when then-President Joe Biden signed his signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. But if anything, that rush accelerated. The 33 additional projects announced by the end of 2024 were the most nationwide, according to E2, an environmental business group. Exact figures differ, but projects in Georgia top $20 billion, pledging more than 25,000 jobs.",
      "Buyers of Qcells solar panels get a 40% federal tax credit, including a 10% bonus for domestic content, which would go away under the bill. Qcells itself would still get production tax credits for panels it started producing last year in Cartersville. The bill would also tax companies that buy panels or components from some foreign countries including China. That could help Qcells, but wouldn't aid domestic producers as much as the domestic content bonus.",
      "When the 1,900-job plant is complete, it will take refined polysilicon, cast it into ingots and then thinly slice ingots into the wafers that become solar cells. Qcells says controlling its own supply chain will let it work more efficiently. Those additional steps would earn the company additional tax credits.",
      "Scott Moskowitz, vice president of market strategy and industry affairs for Qcells, said the company built its first American factory up the road in Dalton during the first Trump administration in response to Trump's protectionist trade policy. Moskowitz argues that a quick curtailment of federal subsidies undercuts Trump's goal of bolstering domestic manufacturing, pushing buyers back to Chinese-controlled producers.",
      "Some local Republicans are expressing alarm, with 16 GOP state legislators imploring Congress in a June 17 letter to preserve tax breaks for solar panels.",
      "\u201cWe urge you not to weaken the tax credits, as doing so would only harm the manufacturing renaissance in Georgia while creating opportunities for Chinese companies to take over the solar industry,\u201d wrote the Georgia lawmakers, led by Republican state Rep. Matthew Gambill of Cartersville.",
      "Some argue it's unfair for Congress to pull the rug out after companies relied on the promise of federal support to invest huge sums.",
      "\u201cI would like to think that from a business perspective that when you have agreements in place that you carry those out to fulfillment,\" Cartersville Mayor Matt Santini said.",
      "Clean energy projects have overwhelmingly located in Republican-held congressional districts, with a report by Atlas Public Policy finding GOP districts host 77% of planned spending.",
      "But Republican U.S. Rep. Barry Loudermilk, who lives in Bartow County, praised the cuts when they passed the House in May, saying the bill would \u201cunleash American energy stifled by the Democrats\u2019 Green New scam\u201d and lauding expansion of oil, gas and coal production on federal lands.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp says he's staying out of the debate.",
      "\u201cOur position is that Congress needs to be the one to decide the future of the IRA,\" said Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas.",
      "Kemp loves green energy investments and jobs, and even declared that his goal is to make Georgia the \u201celectric mobility capital of America.\u201d But Kemp and Ossoff clash over who should get credit for Georgia\u2019s green energy boom. Kemp sharply disputes that the Biden-era incentives spurred the flood of investment, saying many industries were already on their way before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed.",
      "Unlike his current silence, Kemp vociferously opposed some domestic content requirements that made it hard for Hyundai to access the same tax credits as unionized U.S.-based automakers.",
      "\u201cJust generally speaking, the Inflation Reduction Act picked winners and losers, and we saw that negatively impact our partners,\" Douglas said.",
      "All nine of Georgia's Republican House members voted to support the bill, including U.S. Rep Buddy Carter, who earlier signed a letter supporting green energy subsidies. Carter, who is seeking the GOP nomination to oppose Ossoff for Senate in 2026, represents a coastal district that includes a $7.6 billion Hyundai plant in Ellabell that started production last year.",
      "Hyundai wants to make batteries at what would be a 3,500-employee plant near Cartersville so that Hyundai and Kia buyers can fully take advantage of the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles. Those credits would end six months after the bill is enacted under the current version.",
      "The company is publicly sidestepping the current legislative fight. But with American demand for electric vehicles slow to take off, Hyundai now says it will also build gas-electric hybrid vehicles in Ellabell, once projected to make only electric vehicles.",
      "\u201cWe remain focused on electrification because we believe it represents a significant long-term opportunity,\u201d Hyundai spokesperson Michael Stewart said in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, our business is driven by consumer demand, which is why we continue to offer a full range of powertrains.\u201d",
      "Bartow County leaders say it's in everyone's interest to keep the projects on solid footing and that jobs should outweigh politics.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that people are lining up along party lines over this topic,\u201d Santini said.",
      "But Ossoff says partisanship is motivating many Georgia Republicans to turn their backs on the state's economic interests.",
      "\u201cFor national Republicans right now, loyalty to Trump is more important than anything else, and this is what Trump says he wants,\" Ossoff said.",

      "More than 170 EPA employees put their names to the document, with about 100 more signing anonymously out of fear of retaliation, according to Jeremy Berg, a former editor-in-chief of Science magazine who is not an EPA employee but was among non-EPA scientists or academics to also sign. The latter figure includes over 70 Nobel laureates.",
      "The letter represents rare public criticism from agency employees who could face blowback for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health made a similar move earlier in June.",
      "\"Since the Agency\u2019s founding in 1970, EPA has accomplished (its) mission by leveraging science, funding, and expert staff in service to the American people. Today, we stand together in dissent against the current administration\u2019s focus on harmful deregulation, mischaracterization of previous EPA actions, and disregard for scientific expertise,\" the letter read.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m really sad. This agency, that was a superhero for me in my youth, we're not living up to our ideals under this administration. And I really want us to,\u201d said Amelia Hertzberg, an environmental protection specialist at the EPA who has been on administrative leave since February from the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, while the administration works to close down her department.",
      "Hertzberg's work focused on the most vulnerable groups impacted by pollution: pregnant and nursing people, young children and babies, the elderly, people with preexisting and chronic health conditions and people living in communities exposed to higher levels of pollution. That wasn't supposed to be controversial, but it's become so in this political climate, she said.",
      "\u201cAmericans should be able to drink their water and breathe their air without being poisoned. And if they aren\u2019t, then our government is failing,\u201d she said.",
      "Berg, who also directed the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at NIH from 2003-2011, said the dissent isn't motivated by partisan criticism. He said the employees hope it will help the EPA get back to the mission for which it was established \u2014 which \u201conly matters if you breathe air and drink water.\"",
      "The letter outlines what the EPA employees see as five main concerns: undermining public trust; ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters; reversing EPA's progress in America's most vulnerable communities; dismantling the Office of Research and Development; and promoting a culture of fear, forcing staff to choose between their livelihood and well-being.",
      "Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA has cut funding for environmental improvements in minority communities, vowed to roll back federal regulations that lower air pollution in national parks and tribal reservations, wants to undo a ban on a type of asbestos and proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.",
      "Zeldin began reorganizing the EPA\u2019s research and development office as part of his push to slash their budget and gut their study of climate change and environmental justice. And he\u2019s seeking to roll back pollution rules that an Associated Press examination found were estimated to save 30,000 lives and $275 billion every year.",
      "\u201cPeople are going to die,\u201d said Carol Greider, a Nobel laureate and professor of molecular and cellular biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who also signed the letter. She described last week's East Coast heat wave as evidence of the ways people are feeling the effects of climate change. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t have scientists at the EPA to understand how what we do that goes into the air affects our health, more people are going to die,\u201d she added.",
      "Berg said the declarations of dissent from both the NIH and EPA employees are noteworthy because they represent scientists speaking out as their careers are on the line. Even non-agency employees have to consider whether the government will withdraw research funding.",
      "Greider, asked about fears of repercussions or retaliation, said she's \u201cliving the repercussions of everything.\u201d She regularly meets with graduate students who are worried about pursuing scientific careers as labs lose funding.",

    "summary": "A poll shows only 36% of Democrats say they&rsquo;re &ldquo;extremely&rdquo; or &ldquo;very&rdquo; proud to be American, reflecting a dramatic decline in national pride that's also clear among young people",
    "story": [
      "A poll shows only 36% of Democrats say they\u2019re \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d proud to be American, reflecting a dramatic decline in national pride that's also clear among young people",
      "WASHINGTON -- Only 36% of Democrats say they're \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d proud to be American, according to a new Gallup poll, reflecting a dramatic decline in national pride that's also clear among young people.",
      "The findings are a stark illustration of how many \u2014 but not all \u2014 Americans have felt less of a sense of pride in their country over the past decade. The split between Democrats and Republicans, at 56 percentage points, is at its widest since 2001. That includes all four years of Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults who are part of Generation Z, which is defined as those born from 1997 to 2012, expressed a high level of pride in being American in Gallup surveys conducted in the past five years, on average. That's compared with about 6 in 10 Millennials \u2014 those born between 1980 and 1996 \u2014 and at least 7 in 10 U.S. adults in older generations.",
      "\u201cEach generation is less patriotic than the prior generation, and Gen Z is definitely much lower than anybody else,\u201d said Jeffrey Jones, a senior editor at Gallup. \u201cBut even among the older generations, we see that they're less patriotic than the ones before them, and they've become less patriotic over time. That's primarily driven by Democrats within those generations.\u201d",
      "America\u2019s decline in national pride has been a slow erosion, with a steady downtick in Gallup's data since January 2001, when the question was first asked.",
      "Even during the tumultuous early years of the Iraq War, the vast majority of U.S. adults, whether Republican or Democrat, said they were \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d proud to be American. At that point, about 9 in 10 were \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d proud to be American. That remained high in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but the consensus around American pride slipped in the years that followed, dropping to about 8 in 10 in 2006 and continuing a gradual decline.",
      "Now, 58% of U.S. adults say that, in a downward shift that\u2019s been driven almost entirely by Democrats and independents. The vast majority of Republicans continue to say they're proud to be American.",
      "Independents\u2019 pride in their national identity hit a new low in the most recent survey, at 53%, largely following that pattern of gradual decline.",
      "Democrats\u2019 diminished pride in being American is more clearly linked to Trump\u2019s time in office. When Trump first entered the White House, in 2017, about two-thirds of Democrats said they were proud to be American. That had fallen to 42% by 2020, just before Trump lost reelection to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "But while Democrats\u2019 sense of national pride rebounded when Biden took office, it didn\u2019t go back to its pre-Trump levels.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a Trump story,\" Jones said. \u201cSomething else is going on, and I think it\u2019s just younger generations coming in and not being as patriotic as older people.\u201d",
      "Other recent polling shows that Democrats and independents are less likely than Republicans to say that expressing patriotism is important or to feel a sense of pride in their national leaders.",
      "Nearly 9 in 10 Republicans in a 2024 SSRS poll said they believed patriotism has a positive impact on the United States, with Democrats more divided: 45% said patriotism had a positive impact on the country, while 37% said it was negative.",
      "But a more general sense of discontent was clear on both sides of the aisle earlier this year, when a CNN/SSRS poll found that fewer than 1 in 10 Democrats and Republicans said \u201cproud\u201d described the way they felt about politics in America today.",
      "In that survey, most Americans across the political spectrum said they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d or \u201cfrustrated\u201d with the country\u2019s politics.",

      "A judge in Pennsylvania says several witnesses will have to testify at a former criminal justice student's trial on charges he stabbed to death four college students in Idaho in 2022",
      "STROUDSBURG, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania judge on Monday ordered that three people whose testimony has been requested by defense attorneys will have to travel to Idaho to appear at the trial of a man accused of stabbing to death four college students in 2022.",
      "The defense subpoenas were granted regarding a boxing trainer who knew Bryan Kohberger as a teenager, a childhood acquaintance of Kohberger's and a third man whose significance was not explained.",
      "The 30-year-old Kohberger, who was arrested at his parents\u2019 home in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, weeks after the November 2022 killings, is accused of sneaking into a rental home in Moscow, Idaho, not far from the University of Idaho campus, and attacking Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves.",
      "The deaths shocked the rural Idaho community and neighboring Pullman, Washington, where Kohberger was a graduate student studying criminology at Washington State University.",
      "A prison official came to court with records from Kohberger\u2019s stay in the Monroe County Correctional Facility after he was arrested, although the subpoena hearing was continued because he must still provide a statement attesting to their authenticity.",
      "Common Pleas Judge Arthur Zulick also continued for a week the hearing regarding a subpoena for Ralph Vecchio, who owns a car dealership where Kohberger\u2019s parents purchased a Hyundai Elantra in 2019.",
      "There was uncertainty about whether the subpoena was directed at Vecchio or at his father, who owned the business at the time of the purchase. The judge said prosecution witness subpoenas will also be at issue next week.",
      "A sixth witness\u2019 hearing had previously been rescheduled for next week because of a travel conflict, and the seventh person sought by the defense consented last week to travel to Idaho for the trial expected to begin in August.",
      "Brandon Andreola argued unsuccessfully that his subpoena should be canceled, saying he is his family\u2019s sole breadwinner and is worried publicity might lead to him losing his job.",
      "Andreola said his \u201crelationship with Bryan Kohberger has been minimal and distant since high school,\u201d with their last \u201csignificant interaction\u201d taking place in 2020, two years before the stabbings.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m brought out there, I believe the attention will be multiple times greater than the attention that I\u2019ve received already,\u201d Andreola argued.",
      "Jesse Harris said he trained Kohberger as a 15- or 16-year-old at a boxing gym but does not think he has testimony that will help the case. Harris also said a relative\u2019s health problems were an issue and he is needed to run a small construction company.",
      "Zulick approved the summonses for Andreola and Harris, along with a third one for witness Anthony Somma, who did not oppose it. Zulick said Harris can return to his courtroom if his family member\u2019s health issues become a barrier to Harris\u2019 ability to travel to Idaho.",
      "Kohberger's trial on four counts of murder and one count of burglary is on track to begin Aug. 11 in Boise, Idaho, after a judge declined his lawyer's request for a delay last week.",
      "Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.",
      "In a court filing, his lawyers said Kohberger was on a long drive by himself around the time the four were killed.",
      "Kohberger was silent during his arraignment, prompting a judge to enter a not guilty plea on his behalf.",
      "A gag order has largely kept attorneys, investigators and others from speaking publicly about the investigation or trial. The defense team's lawyer in the Monroe County Courthouse on Monday, Abigail Parnell, declined to comment.",

      "Jose Ramon Hernandez Reyes, 38, has been convicted of smuggling migrants and illegally reentering the United States after having been deported. He also pleaded guilty to \u201cdeadly conduct\u201d in connection with a separate incident where he drunkenly fired a gun in a Texas community.",
      "Records reviewed by The Washington Post show that Hernandez Reyes has been released early from federal prison to a halfway house and has been given permission to stay in the U.S. for at least a year.",
      "Prosecutors have identified Hernandez Reyes as the \u201cfirst cooperator\u201d in the case against Abrego, according to court filings. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that Hernandez owned the SUV that Abrego Garcia was allegedly using to smuggle migrants when the Tennessee Highway Patrol stopped him in 2022. That traffic stop is at the center of the criminal investigation against Abrego Garcia.",
      "Hernandez Reyes is among a handful of cooperating witnesses who could help the administration deport Abrego Garcia.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a construction worker who had been living in Maryland, became a flashpoint over Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration policies when he was mistakenly deported to his native El Salvador in March. Facing mounting pressure and a Supreme Court order, the administration returned him this month to face the smuggling charges, which his attorneys have called \u201cpreposterous.\u201d",
      "On Friday, attorneys for Abrego Garcia asked a federal judge in Tennessee to delay his release from jail because of \u201ccontradictory statements\u201d by the administration over whether or not he\u2019ll be deported upon release.",
      "A federal judge in Nashville has been preparing to release Abrego Garcia to await trial on human smuggling charges. But she\u2019s been holding off over concerns that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would swiftly detain him and try to deport him again.",
      "Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys are now asking the judge to continue to detain him following statements by administration officials \u201cbecause we cannot put any faith in any representation made on this issue by\u201d the Justice Department.",

    "story": [
      "Flint, Michigan, is still working on replacing all of its lead pipes",
      "FLINT, Mich. -- Jeffrey Bell watched as crews dug up and replaced neighbors\u2019 lead water pipes, hoping his mother\u2019s house would be next. Workers told him it wasn\u2019t on their list but probably assigned to another contractor.",
      "With Flint's lead pipe replacement program winding down this year, Bell and his elderly mother worried the home they share was forgotten. Betty Bell repeatedly called the city while continuing to buy bottled drinking water, as she had for years. Finally someone called to say the water line was fine \u2014 records indicate it was checked in 2017. But the Bells hadn't known that, exemplifying residents\u2019 confusion over a process marred by delays and poor communication.",
      "\u201cI have even more questions now,\u201d Jeffrey Bell said.",
      "About a decade after Flint\u2019s water crisis caused national outrage, replacement of lead water pipes still isn\u2019t finished. Although the city recently said it completed work required under a legal settlement, the agreement didn\u2019t cover vacant homes and allowed owners to refuse, potentially leaving hundreds of pipes in the ground. The state agreed to oversee work on those properties and says it\u2019s determined to finish by fall.",
      "Flint\u2019s missteps offer lessons for municipalities that face a recently imposed federal mandate to replace their own lead service lines. The Trump administration is expected to soon tell a federal appeals court if it will stand by that mandate.",
      "\u201cI think other cities are racing not to be Flint,\u201d said Margie Kelly, a spokesperson with the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, which reached a settlement with the city to force it to replace lead pipes.",
      "Flint\u2019s crisis was set in motion in 2014, when a state-appointed emergency manager ended a contract with Detroit\u2019s water system and switched to the Flint River to save money. But the state didn't require treatment to prevent corrosion that caused lead to leach into the water.",
      "High levels of lead eventually were detected in drinking water and children\u2019s blood. Outbreaks of Legionnaires\u2019 disease that killed a dozen people were also linked, in part, to the city\u2019s water.",
      "In 2017, Flint entered into a settlement requiring it to replace all lead pipes and fix dug-up yards for free within three years. Funds were directed first toward homes with known lead lines at the NRDC's insistence, which meant workers couldn't tackle neighborhoods systematically. And finding those homes proved challenging because many records were missing or inaccurate \u2014 some handwritten on notecards dating to the early 1900s.",
      "\u201cThe city\u2019s overall management of the program was ineffective,\u201d and it could have better coordinated work geographically, said Sarah Tallman, an attorney with the NRDC.",
      "That stalled the program and, ultimately, the city had to check every pipe anyway. COVID-19 also slowed work.",
      "Flint Department of Public Works Director Kenneth Miller, who was hired last year, said the city didn\u2019t know how many homeowners had opted out of lead pipe replacement or how many properties had simply been missed as contractors came and went.",
      "\u201cJust like any other organization, people get lax, people stop doing things, people get laid off and the person that used to do it doesn\u2019t do it anymore,\u201d he said.",
      "Because the city didn\u2019t keep accurate records of repairs, a judge ordered officials to visually check thousands of properties that had been excavated.",
      "Yards torn up by contractors sometimes sat that way for months or years. For months, Danyele Darrough\u2019s lawn was a mess and the sidewalk and driveway were covered, she said. Grass seed that workers applied never grew. Finally this spring, nearly three years later, she bought bags of topsoil and seed to fix her lawn herself.",
      "\u201cIt was like, yeah, we knew it; we couldn\u2019t trust them,\u201d said Darrough.",
      "Miller said the city now has robust data management, which he recommends to other communities tackling lead lines.",
      "Steep population loss left thousands of vacant homes that will require contractors to cap lead lines where they\u2019re found, said Eric Oswald, drinking water director at Michigan\u2019s Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.",
      "\u201cThe state and the city wanted to absolutely make sure that ... we leave no stone unturned,\u201d he said.",
      "In Flint, government at every level caused the lead crisis or delayed fixing it, according to an EPA inspector general report. The scandal damaged trust in government \u2014 nearly 700 Flint homeowners declined free lead pipe replacement, the NRDC said.",
      "Flint finally adopted an ordinance last year to prevent homeowners from opting out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to get across the finish line unless you\u2019ve got something to enforce,\u201d Oswald said. Benton Harbor, across the state, implemented a similar provision early on, helping its work move smoothly.",
      "Now officials are working from a list of more than 4,000 properties where there could be a lead line, sending letters and making in-person visits to homes, if needed. Miller said he hopes the outreach will show that customer service is now a priority, but it will take time to rebuild trust.",
      "Some also distrust the Environmental Protection Agency, which in May lifted a long-standing emergency order for Flint water. The agency said it\u2019s now safe to drink from the tap after years of tests showing sharply reduced lead levels.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what to believe,\u201d resident Aonie Gilcreast said at a recent community gathering. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust the system\u201d because officials have said \u201ctime after time after time .... that everything was fine.\u201d",
      "As other cities and towns start replacing their own lead pipes \u2014 there are roughly 9 million in the U.S. \u2014 one thing should be top of mind, experts say: Digging them up isn\u2019t just a construction job, but also a test of community trust.",
      "To replace the lines that connect the water main in the street to homes, workers usually must dig in the street and yard, and enter the home. When residents trust local government, they\u2019re more willing to grant that access.",
      "\u201cWith lead, as with everything else, the first time people hear from their water utility can\u2019t be when there is a concern,\u201d said Greg Kail, spokesperson at utility industry group American Water Works Association. Instead, it is important for utilities to reach out to residents about what they plan to do and enlist trusted community groups in the effort.",
      "Newark, New Jersey, avoided Flint's pitfalls when facing its own lead crisis.",
      "In 2019, about two years after elevated levels were revealed and with funds available, the mayor said the city would replace more than 20,000 lead pipes at no cost to residents \u2014 and do it within three years. But a challenge soon emerged: Newark has lots of renters who couldn\u2019t approve the work.",
      "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get into the houses. We couldn\u2019t find the owners,\u201d said Kareem Adeem, Newark\u2019s water and sewer director. \u201cThey don\u2019t live there. They had no interest in taking care of the lead service line.\u201d",
      "So the city passed an ordinance making lead pipe removals mandatory and giving renters permission to approve the work.",
      "Then contractors moved quickly through the city block by block \u2014 a lesson learned from Flint.",
      "For the most stubborn holdouts, officials told them when they\u2019d start replacement work and said they'd turn the water off until the resident allowed them to complete it. The threat was enough. They never had to actually turn off anybody\u2019s water, Adeem said.",
      "Sometimes, people would recognize Adeem from TV and he could start a conversation \u2014 a crack in a resident\u2019s determination to say no. He worked with trusted community groups, too.",
      "And the decision that ensured people\u2019s property was cleaned up afterward? The contractors weren\u2019t fully paid until they finished the work and fixed any damage.",

    "story": [
      "Zohran Mamdani is the expected Democratic nominee for New York City mayor.",
      "NEW YORK -- In choosing Zohran Mamdani as their candidate for mayor, Democrats in America\u2019s most Jewish city have nominated an outspoken critic of Israel, alarming some in New York's Jewish community and signaling a sea change in the priorities of one of the party's most loyal voting groups.",
      "The 33-year-old democratic socialist's surprisingly strong performance against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo makes clear that taking a stance against Israel is no longer disqualifying in a Democratic primary. The state Assembly member has declined to support the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state, refused to denounce the term \u201cglobal intifada\" and supports an organized effort to put economic pressure on Israel through boycotts and other tactics.",
      "Yet he excelled in the city with the largest Jewish population outside of Israel, and with the support of many Jewish voters.",
      "Mamdani's success reflects the ideological realignment of many American Jews since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel that led to Israel's invasion of Gaza. Many Democratic voters, including Jews, have grown dismayed by Israel\u2019s conduct in the war and are deeply critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. That is especially true among younger, more progressive voters, many of whom have rejected the once-broadly accepted notion that anti-Israel sentiment is inherently antisemitic.",
      "For others, Mamdani's showing has spurred new fears about safety and the waning influence of Jewish voters in a city where anti-Jewish hate crime has surged. Last year, Jews were the target of more than half of the hate crimes in the city.",
      "\u201cDefinitely people are concerned,\" said Rabbi Shimon Hecht, of Congregation B\u2019nai Jacob in Brooklyn, who said he has heard from congregants in recent days who hope Mamdani will be beaten in the November general election, where he will face Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and possibly Cuomo, if he stays in the race.",
      "\u201cI think like every upsetting election, it\u2019s a wake-up call for people,\u201d Hecht said. \u201cI strongly believe that he will not be elected as our next mayor, but it's going to take a lot of uniting among the Jewish people and others who are concerned about these issues. We have to unify.\"",
      "Veteran New York Democratic political strategist Hank Sheinkopf put it more bluntly, predicting a hasty exodus of religious Jews from the city and a decline in long-standing Jewish influence that would be replicated elsewhere.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the end of Jewish New York as we know it,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cNew York is a petri dish for national Democratic politics. And what happened here is what will likely happen in cities across the country.\"",
      "Mamdani\u2019s top Democratic rival, the former governor, had called antisemitism and support for Israel \"the most important issue\u201d of the campaign.",
      "Mamdani's backers repeatedly accused Cuomo of trying to weaponize the issue. Many drew parallels to the way Republican President Donald Trump has cast any criticism of Israel's actions as antisemitic, claiming Jews who vote for Democrats \u201chate Israel\" and their own religion.",
      "For some Mamdani supporters, the election results signaled a rejection by voters of one of Cuomo\u2019s arguments: that an upstart socialist with pro-Palestinian views posed a threat to New York\u2019s Jewish community.",
      "Many were focused on issues such as affordability in a notoriously expensive city, or flat-out opposed to Cuomo, who was forced to resign in disgrace amid sexual harassment allegations.",
      "Aiyana Leong Knauer, a 35-year-old Brooklyn bartender who is Jewish and backed Mamdani, said the vote represented \u201cNew Yorkers, many of them Jewish, saying we care more about having an affordable city than sowing division.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of us take really deep offense to our history being weaponized against us,\u201d she said. \u201cJewish people all over the world have well-founded fears for their safety, but Jews in New York are safe overall.\u201d",
      "Others agreed with Mamdani's views on Israel.",
      "Beth Miller, political director of Jewish Voice for Peace Action, an anti-Zionist, progressive group that worked on Mamdani's behalf, said Mamdani \u201cwas actually pretty popular among a lot of Jewish voters.\"",
      "\u201cThat is not in spite of his support for Palestinian rights. That is because of his support for Palestinian rights,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has been a massive rupture within the Jewish community and more and more Jews of all generations, but especially younger generations,\u201d she said, now refuse to be tied to what they see as a rogue government committing atrocities against civilians.",
      "Polls show support for Israel has declined since the war began. Overall, a slight majority of Americans now express a \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d unfavorable opinion of Israel, according to a March Pew Research Center poll, compared with 42% in 2022. Democrats\u2019 views are particularly negative, with nearly 70% holding an unfavorable opinion versus less than 40% of Republicans.",
      "Mamdani's wasn't the only race where Israel was on voters' minds.",
      "In Brooklyn, City Councilwoman Shahana Hanif, who represents Park Slope and surrounding areas, drew criticism for her Palestinian advocacy. Some said she had failed to respond forcefully to antisemitic incidents in the district.",
      "Yet Hanif, the first Muslim woman elected to the City Council, easily beat her top challenger, Maya Kornberg, who is Jewish, despite an influx of money from wealthy, pro-Israel groups and donors.",
      "That outcome dismayed Ramon Maislen, a developer who launched Brooklyn BridgeBuilders to oppose Hanif's reelection and said antisemitism did not seem to resonate with voters.",
      "\u201cWe were very disappointed with our neighbors' response,\" he said.",
      "While campaigning against Hanif, he said he was routinely screamed at by residents and accused of supporting genocide.",
      "\u201cI think that those of us in the Jewish community that are attuned to that are cognizant that there's been some kind of cultural sea change that\u2019s occurring,\" he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a legitimatization of hatred that isn\u2019t happening in any other liberal or progressive space.\"",
      "Mamdani has repeatedly pledged to fight antisemitism, including during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d where he was grilled on his stance. He was joined on the show by city comptroller and fellow candidate Brad Lander, the city's highest-ranking Jewish official, who had cross-endorsed him. He has also said he would increase funding for anti-hate crime programming by 800%.",
      "But many of his comments have angered Jewish groups and officials, most notably his refusal to disavow the phrase \u201cglobalize the intifada,\" which has been used as a slogan in recent protests. Many Jews see it as a call to violence against Israeli civilians. In a podcast interview, Mamdani said the phrase captured a \u201ca desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights.\"",
      "Given another opportunity to condemn the phrase, Mamdani on Sunday told NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that it was not his role to police speech and he pledged to be a mayor who \u201cprotects Jewish New Yorkers and lives up to that commitment through the work that I do.\u201d",
      "Mamdani also supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which aims to pressure governments, schools and other institutions to boycott Israeli products, divest from companies that support the country, and impose sanctions. The Anti-Defamation League calls it antisemitic and part of a broader campaign to \"delegitimize and isolate the State of Israel.\u201d",
      "Mamdani has also said that, as mayor, he would arrest Netanyahu if the Israeli leader tried to enter the city.",
      "The ADL in a statement Thursday warned candidates and their supporters not to use \"language playing into dangerous antisemitic canards that time and time again have been used to incite hatred and violence against Jews.\u201d",
      "In his victory speech, Mamdani alluded to the criticism he'd received and said he would not abandon his beliefs. But he also said he would \"reach further to understand the perspectives of those with whom I disagree and to wrestle deeply with those disagreements.\u201d",

    "summary": "Some Iranians are getting arrested by immigration authorities after living decades in the United States",
    "story": [
      "Some Iranians are getting arrested by immigration authorities after living decades in the United States",
      "Mandonna \u201cDonna\u201d Kashanian lived in the United States for 47 years, married a U.S. citizen and raised their daughter. She was gardening in the yard of her New Orleans home when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers handcuffed and took her away, her family said.",
      "Kashanian arrived in 1978 on a student visa and applied for asylum, fearing retaliation for her father's support of the U.S.-backed shah. She lost her bid, but she was allowied to remain with her husband and child if she checked in regularly with immigration officials, her husband and daughter said. She complied, once checking in from South Carolina during Hurricane Katrina. She is now being held at an immigration detention center in Basile, Louisiana, while her family tries to get information.",
      "Other Iranians are also getting arrested by immigration authorities after decades in the United States. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security won't say how many people they've arrested, but U.S. military strikes on Iran have fueled fears that there is more to come.",
      "\u201cSome level of vigilance, of course, makes sense, but what it seems like ICE has done is basically give out an order to round up as many Iranians as you can, whether or not they\u2019re linked to any threat and then arrest them and deport them, which is very concerning,\u201d said Ryan Costello, policy director of the National Iranian American Council, an advocacy group.",
      "Homeland Security did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on Kashanian's case but have been touting arrests of Iranians. The department announced the arrests of at least 11 Iranians on immigration violations during the weekend of the U.S. missile strikes. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said, without elaborating, that it arrested seven Iranians at a Los Angeles-area address that \u201chas been repeatedly used to harbor illegal entrants linked to terrorism.\"",
      "The department \"has been full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and violent extremists that illegally entered this country, came in through Biden\u2019s fraudulent parole programs or otherwise,\u201d spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said of the 11 arrests. She didn't offer any evidence of terrorist or extremist ties. Her comment on parole programs referred to President Joe Biden's expanded legal pathways to entry, which his successor, Donald Trump, shut down.",
      "Russell Milne, Kashanian\u2019s husband, said his wife is not a threat. Her appeal for asylum was complicated because of \u201cevents in her early life,\" he explained. A court found an earlier marriage of hers to be fraudulent.",
      "But over four decades, Kashanian, 64, built a life in Louisiana. The couple met when she was bartending as a student in the late 1980s. They married and had a daughter. She volunteered with Habitat for Humanity, filmed Persian cooking tutorials on YouTube and was a grandmother figure to the children next door.",
      "The fear of deportation always hung over the family, Milne said, but he said his wife did everything that was being asked of her.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s meeting her obligations,\" Milne said. \"She\u2019s retirement age. She\u2019s not a threat. Who picks up a grandmother?\u201d",
      "While Iranians have been crossing the border illegally for years, especially since 2021, they have faced little risk of being deported to their home countries due to severed diplomatic relations with the U.S. That seems to no longer be the case.",
      "The Trump administration has deported hundreds of people, including Iranians, to countries other than their own in an attempt to circumvent diplomatic hurdles with governments that won\u2019t take their people back. During Trump\u2019s second term, countries including El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama have taken back noncitizens from the U.S.",
      "The administration has asked the Supreme Court to clear the way for several deportations to South Sudan, a war-ravaged country with which it has no ties, after the justices allowed deportations to countries other than those noncitizens came from.",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol arrested Iranians 1,700 times at the Mexican border from October 2021 through November 2024, according to the most recent public data available. The Homeland Security Department reported that about 600 Iranians overstayed visas as business or exchange visitors, tourists and students in the 12-month period through September 2023, the most recent data reports.",
      "Iran was one of 12 countries subject to a U.S. travel ban that took effect this month. Some fear ICE's growing deportation arrests will be another blow.",
      "In Oregon, an Iranian man was detained by immigration agents this past week while driving to the gym. He was picked up roughly two weeks before he was scheduled for a check-in at ICE offices in Portland, according to court documents filed by his attorney, Michael Purcell.",
      "The man, identified in court filings as S.F., has lived in the U.S. for over 20 years, and his wife and two children are U.S. citizens.",
      "S.F. applied for asylum in the U.S. in the early 2000s, but his application was denied in 2002. His appeal failed but the government did not deport him and he continued to live in the country for decades, according to court documents.",
      "Due to \u201cchanged conditions\u201d in Iran, S.F. would face \u201ca vastly increased danger of persecution\u201d if he were to be deported, Purcell wrote in his petition. \u201cThese circumstances relate to the recent bombing by the United States of Iranian nuclear facilities, thus creating a de facto state of war between the United States and Iran.\u201d",
      "S.F.\u2019s long residency in the U.S., his conversion to Christianity and the fact that his wife and children are U.S. citizens \u201csharply increase the possibility of his imprisonment in Iran, or torture or execution,\u201d he said.",
      "Similarly, Kashanian's daughter said she is worried what will happen to her mother.",
      "\u201cShe tried to do everything right,\u201d Kaitlynn Milne said.",

      "Pride celebrations are typically a daylong mix of jubilant street parties and political protest, but organizers said this year\u2019s iterations will take a more defiant stance than recent years.",
      "The festivities come days after the tenth anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark June 26, 2015, ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that recognized same-sex marriage nationwide.",

      "Among the other headwinds faced by gay rights groups this year is the loss of corporate sponsorship.",
      "American companies have pulled back support of Pride events, reflecting a broader walking back of diversity and inclusion efforts amid shifting public sentiment.",
      "NYC Pride said earlier this month that about 20% of its corporate sponsors dropped or reduced support, including PepsiCo and Nissan. Organizers of San Francisco Pride said they lost the support of five major corporate donors, including Comcast and Anheuser-Busch.",

      "The Florida immigration detention site dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d is being met by opposition from a range of groups concerned with its impacts on local Native American tribes, the Everglades ecosystem and human rights for migrants",
      "A coalition of groups, ranging from environmental activists to Native Americans advocating for their ancestral homelands, converged outside an airstrip in the Florida Everglades Saturday to protest the imminent construction of an immigrant detention center.",
      "Hundreds of protesters lined part of U.S. Highway 41 that slices through the marshy Everglades \u2014 also known as Tamiami Trail \u2014 as dump trucks hauling materials lumbered into the airfield. Cars passing by honked in support as protesters waved signs calling for the protection of the expansive preserve that is home to a few Native tribes and several endangered animal species.",
      "Christopher McVoy, an ecologist, said he saw a steady stream of trucks entering the site while he protested for hours. Environmental degradation was a big reason why he came out Saturday. But as a South Florida city commissioner, he said concerns over immigration raids in his city also fueled his opposition.",
      "\u201cPeople I know are in tears, and I wasn't far from it,\u201d he said.",
      "Florida officials have forged ahead over the past week in constructing the compound dubbed as \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d within the Everglades' humid swamplands.",
      "The government fast-tracked the project under emergency powers from an executive order issued by Gov. Ron DeSantis that addresses what he views as a crisis of illegal immigration. That order lets the state sidestep certain purchasing laws and is why construction has continued despite objections from Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and local activists.",
      "The facility will have temporary structures like heavy-duty tents and trailers to house detained immigrants. The state estimates that by early July, it will have 5,000 immigration detention beds in operation.",
      "The compound's proponents have noted its location in the Florida wetlands \u2014 teeming with massive reptiles like alligators and invasive Burmese pythons \u2014 make it an ideal spot for immigration detention.",
      "\u201cClearly, from a security perspective, if someone escapes, you know, there\u2019s a lot of alligators,\u201d DeSantis said Wednesday. \u201cNo one\u2019s going anywhere.\u201d",
      "Under DeSantis, Florida has made an aggressive push for immigration enforcement and has been supportive of the federal government's broader crackdown on illegal immigration. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has backed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d which DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said will be partially funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
      "But Native American leaders in the region have seen the construction as an encroachment onto their sacred homelands, which prompted Saturday's protest. In Big Cypress National Preserve, where the airstrip is located, 15 traditional Miccosukee and Seminole villages, as well as ceremonial and burial grounds and other gathering sites, remain.",
      "Others have raised human rights concerns over what they condemn as the inhumane housing of immigrants. Worries about environmental impacts have also been at the forefront, as groups such as the Center for Biological Diversity and the Friends of the Everglades filed a lawsuit Friday to halt the detention center plans.",
      "\u201cThe Everglades is a vast, interconnected system of waterways and wetlands, and what happens in one area can have damaging impacts downstream,\" Friends of the Everglades executive director Eve Samples said. \u201cSo it's really important that we have a clear sense of any wetland impacts happening in the site.\u201d",
      "Bryan Griffin, a DeSantis spokesperson, said Friday in response to the litigation that the facility was a \u201cnecessary staging operation for mass deportations located at a preexisting airport that will have no impact on the surrounding environment.\u201d",
      "Until the site undergoes a comprehensive environmental review and public comment is sought, the environmental groups say construction should pause. The facility's speedy establishment is \u201cdamning evidence\u201d that state and federal agencies hope it will be \u201ctoo late\u201d to reverse their actions if they are ordered by a court to do so, said Elise Bennett, a Center for Biological Diversity senior attorney working on the case.",
      "The potential environmental hazards also bleed into other aspects of Everglades life, including a robust tourism industry where hikers walk trails and explore the marshes on airboats, said Floridians for Public Lands founder Jessica Namath, who attended the protest. To place an immigration detention center there makes the area unwelcoming to visitors and feeds into the misconception that the space is in \u201cthe middle of nowhere,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cEverybody out here sees the exhaust fumes, sees the oil slicks on the road, you know, they hear the sound and the noise pollution. You can imagine what it looks like at nighttime, and we're in an international dark sky area,\u201d Namath said. \u201cIt's very frustrating because, again, there's such disconnect for politicians.\u201d",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sean-diddy-combs-trial-jury-deliberations-start/",
    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 17:58:57 -0400",
    "summary": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' fate is in a jury's hands after listening to weeks of sometimes graphic and emotional testimony.",
    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking case in New York shared concerns about an individual juror with the judge not long after they started deliberating Monday. The first day of deliberations ultimately ended without a verdict.",
      "After more than two hours of legal instructions from federal Judge Arun Subramanian, the jury of eight men and four women headed behind closed doors to deliberate at around 11:30 a.m. Subramanian told the five alternate jurors to remain on standby in case they're needed to fill in on the main jury who are weighing charges that could put the hip-hop mogul in prison for life.",
      "About 10 minutes into deliberations, the jury sent a note indicating they'd completed their first order of business: electing a foreperson.",
      "Less than two hours later, at about 1:25 p.m., a note from the jury was read in court  to inform the judge of concerns regarding one juror's ability to follow the instructions. The jury asked the judge to question this juror. The judge discussed the response with the prosecution and defense and decided to remind the jury of their obligation to follow the law and resume their deliberations.",
      "After the judge originally proposed asking the jury foreperson the nature of concerns about the fellow juror, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo suggested caution and that less be said rather than more.",
      "\"We can always ratchet it up. We can't ratchet it down,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the late afternoon, the jury sent the judge a new note with a question about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 stemming from the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The judge told the court he'd answer them on Tuesday and dismissed the jury for the day.",
      "Jurors are being provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",
      "Subramanian had stressed to the jury the importance of delivering a unanimous verdict, but also said no juror should surrender their beliefs in order to reach unanimity.",
      "Ahead of the deliberations, CBS News legal contributor Caroline Polisi, a criminal defense attorney, discussed on \"CBS Mornings\" what judges typically tell juries.",
      "\"The judge will instruct the jurors, 'maintain your own integrity with respect to what you believe, but keep an open mind, engage in discussions with other jurors, look at the evidence, see other people's point of view, and if you can with integrity really come over to, you know, the other side, then you can get to unanimity,'\" Polisi said.",
      "As the deliberations got underway, Combs faced his family and supporters in the courtroom gallery. They bowed their heads in prayer \u2014 his family members holding hands with each other. When they finished, they all applauded.",
      "The judge granted Combs' request to have some books with him during the deliberations. On his way out of the courtroom on Monday, Combs showed two books to reporters: \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" and \"The Happiness Advantage.\"",
      "The jury will sift through seven weeks of sometimes graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking \u2014 relating to two of his ex-girlfriends \u2014 and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "Polisi said the prosecution's best chance at getting a conviction could be with the sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"The prosecution made clear there only has to be one instance, out of these hundreds of 'freak-offs,' one instance where it was coerced by force, fraud or coercion, and that can include threats of harm that doesn't even include physical harm,\" Polisi said. \"So that can include fear of financial harm, fear of reputational harm. Remember, he videotaped all of these encounters, and the government laid out specific instances where he threatened to release those tapes.\"",
      "In closing arguments last week, federal prosecutors and Combs' defense team took their last shots at convincing jurors to convict or acquit the Grammy Award-winning founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law.\"",
      "She said that he used his \"close inner circle and a small army of personal staff, who made it their mission to meet the defendant's every desire, promote his power and protect his reputation at all costs.\"",
      "Agnifilo countered, \"This isn't about crime. It's about money.\" He noted that one of Combs' accusers in the criminal case also sued him in civil court.",
      "\"He is not a racketeer. He is not a conspirator to commit racketeering. He is none of these things. He is innocent. He sits there innocent. Return him to his family, who have been waiting for him,\" the lawyer told jurors.",
      "In all, 34 witnesses testified, headlined by Combs' former girlfriends Cassie \u2014 the R&B singer born Casandra Ventura \u2014 and \"Jane,\" who testified under a pseudonym. Both women said he often was violent toward them. Cassie said he forced her into hundreds of sexual encounters with paid male sex workers while Jane recounted numerous \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Jurors also saw now-infamous security camera video of Combs beating, kicking and dragging Cassie at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 and clips from videos of sexual encounters.",
      "Combs chose not to testify, and his lawyers didn't call any witnesses in their defense case. His attorneys elected instead to challenge the accusers' credibility during lengthy cross-examination questioning.",
      "The defense has acknowledged that Combs veered into violence, but his lawyers maintain that the sex acts were consensual. They contend that prosecutors are intruding in Combs' personal life and that he's done nothing to warrant the charges against him.",

      "The 6-foot-5 outfielder Dave Parker (June 9, 1951-June 28, 2025), nicknamed \"the Cobra,\" was one of the best players of his era, part of two World Series championship teams: the Pittsburgh Pirates' \"We Are Family\" squad in 1979, and the Oakland A's in 1989.",
      "Beginning in 1973, Parker played 19 seasons in the majors, 11 for the Pirates. He was the National League MVP in 1978. He also played four seasons in his hometown with the Cincinnati Reds, and later wore the jerseys of the Milwaukee Brewers, California Angels and Toronto Blue Jays.",
      "Parker was a seven-time All-Star and three-time Gold Glove right fielder, won National League batting titles in 1977 and '78, and led the NL with 125 RBIs in 1985. He finished his career as a .290 hitter with 339 homers and 1,493 RBIs.",
      "He was set to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame next month.",
      "Parker, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2012, told reporters that he burst into tears upon learning of his selection to Cooperstown. \"Yeah, I cried,\" Parker said after receiving the news. \"It only took a few minutes, because I don't cry.",
      "\"I was a five-tool player. I could do them all,\" Parker said. \"I never trotted to first base. I don't know if people noticed that, but I ran hard on every play.\""

    "summary": "The BBC says it regrets not cutting off the Glastonbury festival live stream of punk-rap duo Bob Vylan's performance, which included an anti-Israel chant.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014 The BBC has said it regrets not pulling down its live stream of a performance at the Glastonbury music festival over the weekend that included what the broadcaster calls \"utterly unacceptable\" chants against Israel's military.",
      "The taxpayer-funded BBC said in a statement Monday that it regrets not cutting short its live streaming signal after punk-rap duo Bob Vylan started leading a chant of \"Death, death to the IDF,\" during their Saturday performance, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "\"The BBC respects freedom of expression but stands firmly against incitement to violence,\" the statement\u00a0from the broadcaster said. \"The antisemitic sentiments expressed by Bob Vylan were utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves... The [BBC broadcasting] team were dealing with a live situation but with hindsight we should have pulled the stream during the performance. We regret this did not happen.\"",
      "The BBC, which is CBS News' partner network in the U.K., quickly acknowledged that the language used on Saturday was \"deeply offensive,\" but the network was criticized \u2014 including by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and members of his cabinet \u2014\u2014 for not reacting more quickly after the chant started.",
      "Glastonbury festival's organizers also condemned the chant in a statement, saying: \"Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\"",
      "The reaction from the Trump administration appeared to be significantly harsher, with Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau saying in a social media post on Monday that U.S. entry visas already issued to Bob Vylan's members had been revoked \"in light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants.\"",
      "The band's website shows more than a dozen scheduled tour dates in the U.S., from coast to coast, starting in late October.",
      "\"Foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,\" Landau said in the post.",
      "On Sunday, Bob Vylan posted a lengthy statement on their Instagram\u00a0page, with the caption: \"I said what I said.\"",
      "The duo, who use stage names and keep their identities anonymous, said their message was aimed at younger generations, whom they said should be shown how to fight for their own futures.",
      "\"Let us display to them loudly and visibly the right thing to do when we want and need change,\" the band said. \"Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organizing online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered.\"",
      "Local police have launched an investigation into the chants to determine whether any criminal offenses may have been committed.",
      "Glastonbury is a five-day music festival that takes place on a farm in the southwest of England. It is one of the largest music festivals anywhere in the world, drawing more than 200,000 ticketholders, and it generally takes place every other year as the organizers give the farm fields time to recover from the impact of so many revelers. The event is hosted and organized by the Eavis family, who still own the farm, and has been running for about 55 years.",
      "Bob Vylan's performance preceded that of Northern Irish rappers Kneecap, whose set the BBC did not air live due to previous instances at the group's concerts involving alleged comments supporting Hamas and Hezbollah and calling for the death of Conservative party lawmakers.",
      "Kneecap's members have insisted that they \"do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah.\"",
      "They sent \"heartfelt apologies\" to the families of two British lawmakers who were murdered in recent years after their remarks about Conservative parliamentarians.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 10:12:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The fighter for Truth, Justice and the American Way is back on the big screen. Director James Gunn talks about his re-imagining of the Man of Steel, and actor David Corenswet discusses the challenges of taking on the iconic role.",
    "story": [
      "He was born on the planet Krypton. But the Man of Steel comes to life in California, inside an edit room in Burbank. It's there that James Gunn is reviewing a scene from what Warner Brothers hopes is a summer blockbuster: \"Superman.\" With a reported budget of at least $225 million, it arrives in theaters July 11.",
      "It's the first feature from DC Studios, a division of Warner Brothers.\u00a0 Gunn is not only the film's director; he wrote the screenplay, and he's DC's CEO.",
      "\"I feel good about the movie,\" he said. \"And I'm excited about that. And I think we've done something that's different.\"",
      "Among those differences: \"My Superman is not indestructible,\" Gunn said. \"We see him bleed, immediately. At times, I've thought, 'He's too strong.' You don't want him to be able to punch a planet in half or, for that matter, go around a planet a billion times and make time go backwards, you know? I wanted a Superman who was a little bit more down-to-Earth.\"",
      "And few things are more down-to-Earth than a dog. \"The dog is the whole reason \u2013 [it] was the start of the movie for me, a thousand percent,\" Gunn said. \"I adopted a dog. His name is Ozu. And he didn't want to be touched, he had never known human beings. He chewed up all our furniture. He was, you know, chasing the cat, and just being the worst dog you can imagine. And I thought, 'Wow. What if this terrible dog had super powers? I'd really be screwed!'\"",
      "The first Superman feature film came in 1951 with George Reeves, who later played the role on TV. In this century, Superman has been played by Brandon Routh and Henry Cavill. But in the last 75 years, only one big screen Superman has fully captured the audience's imagination: Christopher Reeve.",
      "Trained in the theater, Reeve was a graduate of the Juilliard School in New York \u2013 as is the new Superman, David Corenswet. He is 31 \u2013 seven years older than Reeve was when he made his debut in 1978. \"I don't think there's any way or reason to try to sort of live up to Christopher Reeve,\" Corenswet said. \"I just feel grateful to get to play that character that he embodied and put into the public consciousness in such a positive and strong way.\"",
      "We met Corenswet at the Arden Theatre in Philadelphia. It's Corenswet's hometown, where he still lives, and it's at the Arden where he landed his first paid gig, when he was nine years old: \"All My Sons\" by Arthur Miller.",
      "Like his Superman, Corenswet is immediately disarming, as well as vulnerable, as in a scene with Superman's girlfriend, reporter Lois Lane (played by Rachel Brosnahan).",
      "\"He is definitively different from everybody else on Earth,\" Corenswet said. \"He is not human. He's an alien, and he has these powers that nobody else has. And at the same time, he wants desperately to be a part of humanity. So ultimately, the dramatic stakes of Superman as a character is that he is lonely and he doesn't want to be.\"",
      "He also has a sense of humor about those red shorts. \"Without the trunks, the uniform can look very military,\" Corenswet said. \"So he puts the red underwear on, a) so that everybody can see him, against the blue sky you can see the red trunks, b) so that everybody knows he doesn't take himself too seriously. He's not trying to look cool.",
      "\"Now, that doesn't in any way undermine how badass and cool he is when he's up in the sky fighting the bad guys. But once he touches down, he wants to be the one that people can laugh or make fun of, because he can take it.\"",
      "Superman has been saving the world for nearly nine decades. Created by Jerry Siegel and drawn by Joe Shuster, he first appeared in a comic in 1938.",
      "Asked if Superman represents the signature American movie character, critic and filmmaker Elvis Mitchell said, \"I think he's bigger than that. Spider-Man is tortured. You know, he has to support himself and his aunt, and he's responsible for the death of his uncle. And Batman's responsible for the death of everybody in his line of sight. They're all sufferers.",
      "\"But Superman, he stands tall, and there's a pride of authorship, literally, in the character. 'Cause he's creating his own narrative as his alter ego. People want to see that. They want to believe that you can create your own narrative in a way that is benevolent, even if you have all the power in the world. It's wrong of you to turn away from people who need your help.\"",
      "Asked what he wants audiences around the world to take away from his Superman, Gunn said, \"I think, just culturally, being able to place a little bit more importance on being a good human being. I think we're surrounded by a lot of meanness. I think Superman is surrounded by a lot of meanness in the movie. But he stands against that grain. And that's what makes him rebellious.",
      "\"And in a way, I think today, in today's world, Superman's the edgier, more rebellious character because he's the one who's standing up for the values that most people are not,\" he said.",
      "Corenswet is embracing the challenge, fully aware that success could mean Superman defines his career. He said, \"When you take a role that's gonna be this visible and this iconic, even just visually iconic, and it's your face and the underwear, yeah, I wanted to be prepared for the possibility that it wouldn't lead to a bunch of other things, that this would be the thing.",
      "\"And I felt really lucky that when I asked myself that question the answer came back, somebody's gotta play this part, and if you're the person to play it and you give up everything else to do it, it would be worth doing.\"",

    "summary": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' defense attorney gave his closing argument a day after the prosecution's. Jurors will start deliberating on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs\u00a0was portrayed in his lawyer's closing argument on Friday as the victim of an overzealous prosecution that tried to turn the recreational use of drugs and a swinger lifestyle into a racketeering conspiracy that could put the music mogul behind bars for life.",
      "Attorney Marc Agnifilo mocked the government's case against Combs and belittled the agents who seized hundreds of bottles of Astroglide lubricant and baby oil at his properties as he began his four-hour presentation Friday in a New York courtroom.",
      "\"Way to go, fellas,\" he said of the agents.",
      "He said prosecutors had \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes to combine it with recreational drug use and call it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Agnifilo said of Combs: \"He sits there innocent. Return him to his family who have been waiting for him.\"",
      "Agnifilo called Combs' prosecution a \"fake trial\" and ridiculed the notion that he engaged in racketeering. \"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?\" Agnifilo asked. \"Did any witness get on that witness stand and say yes, I was part of a racketeering enterprise \u2014 I engaged in racketeering?\" No, Agnifilo argued, telling jurors that those accusations were a figment of the prosecution's imagination.",
      "The lawyer argued prosecutors had invaded Combs' most intimate personal affairs, telling jurors: \"Where's the crime scene? It's your sex life.\"",
      "Agnifilo also argued there's another factor at play in the allegations that women have lobbed against Combs: the prospect of draining him of his wealth through lawsuits.",
      "\"This isn't about crime. It's about money. This is about money,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the prosecution's rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said Agnifilo had spent \"a whole lot of energy\" trying to distract from Combs' \"inexcusable behavior.\"",
      "\"Make no mistake,\" Comey told jurors, \"this trial was about how in Sean Combs' world, 'no' was never an option.\"",
      "In his closing argument, Agnifilo reiterated that the defense \"owns\" the fact that Combs was violent but argued that behavior does not justify the grave charges against him.",
      "Combs and R&B singer\u00a0Cassie Ventura Fine\u00a0had a \"loving, beautiful relationship,\" albeit a \"complicated\" one, Agnifilo said. \"If racketeering conspiracy had an opposite, it would be their relationship,\" Agnifilo said. \"They were deeply in love with each other.\"",
      "In her rebuttal, Comey said, \"Being a domestic abuser is not a defense to sex trafficking.\"",
      "Jurors are expected to begin deliberating on Monday.",
      "Combs' family, including six of his children and his mother, were in the audience for the defense's closing, which took place a day after the prosecution made its closing arguments Thursday \u2014 after calling on 34 witnesses over the course of seven weeks. Combs' ex-girlfriend, Ventura Fine, and rapper\u00a0Kid Cudi, were among those who testified.",
      "The trial of Combs, 55, began on May 12. Prosecutors allege he relied on employees, resources and influence of his business empire to create a criminal enterprise that engaged in \u2014 or attempted to engage in \u2014 \"sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for the purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.\"",
      "Combs has denied the allegations against him and\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to five counts. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.",
      "Combs has been present at the trial but told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian earlier this week that he decided not to testify.",
      "\"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I'm making it,\" he said.",
      "The defense\u00a0rested\u00a0on Tuesday after presenting its case for less than 30 minutes. It didn't call any witnesses.",
      "Combs' lawyers built their case for acquittal through lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Some testified only in response to subpoenas and insisted they didn't want to be there.",
      "In federal prosecutors' closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said to the jury that Combs used \"power, violence and fear\" to rule a criminal enterprise, which allegedly facilitated brutal sex crimes. Slavik said Combs \"counted on silence and shame\" to allow his abuse to continue. She also said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up.",
      "\"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Lalo Schifrin, the composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \"Mission: Impossible\" and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, died Thursday. He was 93.",
      "Schifrin's son, Ryan Schifrin, confirmed the death to CBS News in a statement, saying his father \"succumbed to complications from pneumonia.\"",
      "\"His family was at his side, and he passed peacefully,\" Schifrin said. \"We are grateful for the opportunity to be there for him. We are still trying to process this loss, and are very moved by all the love and support we have received.\"",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \"Cool Hand Luke,\" \"The Fox,\" \"Voyage of the Damned,\" \"The Amityville Horror\" and \"The Sting II.\"",
      "\"Every movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \"The movie dictates what the music will be.\"",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan.",
      "Schifrin's composition of the \"Mission: Impossible\" theme",
      "But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television's \"Mission: Impossible,\" which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \"only the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\" by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song, but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\"The producer called me and told me, 'You're going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it's going to start with a fuse,'\" Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \"So I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that's why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\"",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin's music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin's music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\"I remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\" Giacchino told NPR. \"And I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, 'Just have fun with it.' And I did.\"",
      "\"Mission: Impossible\" won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996's first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand's Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Schifrin's background and his other prolific work",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band.",
      "Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie's quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \"Gillespiana.\"",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965's \"Jazz Suite on the Mass Texts\" while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV's \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \"Tango,\" \"Rush Hour\" and its two sequels, \"Bringing Down The House,\" \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey,\" \"After the Sunset\" and the horror film \"Abominable.\"",
      "Writing the arrangements for \"Dirty Harry,\" Schifrin decided that the main character wasn't in fact Clint Eastwood's hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\"You would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\" he told the AP. \"I wrote a theme for Scorpio.\"",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\"Receiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\" Schifrin said at the time. \"It is mission accomplished.\"",
      "Among Schifrin's conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California's Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \"Christmas in Vienna\" in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \"Letters from Argentina,\" nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event's 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \"Songs of the Aztecs.\" The work premiered at Mexico's Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site's Aztec temple.",
      "\"I found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \"But the real answer is that there's something magic about it. ... There's something magic in the art of music anyway.\"",

      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \"Bobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light.\"",
      "Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech\u00a0on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 09:20:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Scientists conducting medical research are facing an existential crisis: Layoffs and budget cuts pushed by President Trump that, they say, jeopardize finding a cure for cancer.",
    "story": [
      "They might easily be mistaken for Congressional staffers, reluctant to face the day, but these are among the most accomplished cancer specialists in the country, meeting with Representatives, Senators and staff. Among them: Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, from up the road in Baltimore; and Dr. George Weiner, a cancer specialist in Iowa for more than 35 years, who has flown in frequently to lobby Congress for more research funds.",
      "Lobbying for cancer research, he says, used to be like pushing on an open door. \"Most of the time when I've come, I've met with Democrats and Republicans, and we talked about the bipartisan support for cancer research,\" Weiner said. \"This is the first time that I felt there was an existential crisis in our ability to make the type of progress that I see in front of us.\"",
      "These days, the conversation is all about thousands of layoffs \u2026 delays in research \u2026 massive budget cuts \u2013 close to a 40% proposed cut in funding for the National Cancer Institute.",
      "\"I wake up every morning looking at my phone: Did I get an email from the National Cancer Institute saying I'm no longer receiving my grants?\" said Jaffee.",
      "Has she felt the impact yet? \"Oh, yeah, we certainly have felt the impact, to the point where people are leaving,\" Jaffee replied. \"So, in our clinical research operation, which takes years to build, train research nurses, takes two years to train coordinators, takes six to 12 months, these people are leaving because the funding isn't coming in.\"",
      "I asked, \"If they keep cutting back, how long before Dr. Jaffee says, 'That's it'?\"",
      "\"I have to be honest, there are days when I do feel that,\" she replied. \"But I look around and I feel like I would be disloyal to our patients. We are in a technological revolution in cancer research. We are rapidly making discoveries that we couldn't even do ten years ago.\"",
      "\"What price do you put on life?\"",
      "Kevin Callahan was a Marine in Vietnam when he barely survived stepping on a land mine. Decades later, he was diagnosed with a killer disease: pancreatic cancer. First came surgery and chemo. Now, he's part of a clinical trial, which is where Dr. Jaffee and her colleague Dr. Neeha Zaidi come in, working to develop a vaccine to prevent pancreatic cancer from recurring.",
      "I asked Callahan, \"When you see some of the debates that are going on right now, and it relates to the National Cancer Institute and NIH \u2026\"",
      "\"It raises the hair on the back of my neck,\" he replied.",
      "Beth Callahan wasn't all that sure about the clinical trial at first, but Kevin couldn't stop thinking about all that had gone into it \u2013 getting chemotherapy as an approved treatment. \"They would shoot me up with three drugs, and the fourth one I would go home with a little bag on my chest, and it wouldn't come out until Friday. It had to be done over 40 hours. I thought to myself, 'How many poor bastards went through tests to get that done?' So I thought, 'If there's anything that I can do, I'm more than happy to go in with the study and see if I can help somebody else later on, [to] develop this vaccine.'\"",
      "Pancreatic cancer is particularly nasty, even when, as with Kevin, it's detected early. The experimental vaccine they've been administering to him is promising, but according to Jaffee, the chances of recurrence are 80%, and the chances of a patient being alive in five years is 20%.",
      "Yet, Kevin is four-and-a-half years out, without recurrence, \"part of a small cohort of patients who received the vaccine on that trial who are, like him, doing well without recurrence,\" Jaffee said.",
      "I asked, \"Could it be anything other than the vaccine?",
      "Jaffee replied, \"We don't believe so. This is not a cancer where sometimes it looks less aggressive than other times. This is a cancer that uniformly \u2013 it doesn't matter who you are \u2013 it comes back.\"",
      "And so far, it has not. Kevin says, \"Bottom line, I'm cancer free.\"",
      "Now the Callahans are concerned the cuts at the NIH could interfere with \u2013 or even stop \u2013 Kevin's vaccine trial.",
      "I said, \"They claim that they're not cutting back on any of the science, on any of the people who are really doing the research.\"",
      "\"I don't believe that for a minute,\" said Kevin.",
      "Asked if it is worth the money invested by taxpayers, Beth responded: \"What price do you put on life? It's our lives. It's our children's lives. It's our grandchildren's lives. What price do you put on that? We're not just talking about cutting funding to individual research programs. We're talking about NIH, which is a gift that we have had in this country for decades. Why would we give that up as a country?\"",
      "Located just outside of Washington, D.C., the National Cancer Institute is the crown jewel of the National Institutes of Health. It is also the most expensive. Its budget last year was $7 billion.",
      "Dr. Weiner noted, \"Mary Lasker, who was a brilliant woman and a force of nature who worked with Richard Nixon on the original war on cancer, would say, 'If you think research is expensive, try disease.'\"",
      "The Trump administration is proposing cutting that $7 billion cancer budget down to about $4.5 billion. Weiner thinks that America's widely-recognized position as the world's leader in medical research is at a tipping point. \"Progress is gonna be proportional to investment,\" he said. \"So, progress is not gonna totally stop if funding drops dramatically. But the more it drops and the longer it drops, the slower progress will be.",
      "\"But that's not the case for patients,\" he said. \"Our job as researchers is to bring those advances to help those patients as soon as possible, because those patients can't wait.\"",
      "That would describe Natalie Phelps' dilemma to a T.",
      "\"When is cancer political?",
      "Natalie Phelps has Stage 4 metastatic colorectal cancer. \u00a0She and her husband, Jeff, live out in Washington State.",
      "\"We have one boy, one girl, and a giant German Shepherd, very average American,\" she said. \"And I had always hoped, if I needed a clinical trial, I was like, 'I'm gonna get to the NIH. I'm gonna go to the top place in the world.'\"",
      "Phelps was invited to NIH for testing to determine if she qualified for a promising breakthrough immunotherapy treatment that has shrunk tumors in about a quarter of the patients with gastrointestinal cancers. \u00a0She said, \"When I was invited to go back, I had cancer patients congratulating me. They were like, 'You made it!' It's like making it into the Olympics when you're a cancer patient.\"",
      "The clinical trial is run by Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a legend in the field of cancer research who is still practicing in his mid-eighties. \"Well, she's a young woman with a metastatic cancer, and so that's a desperate situation. Every patient we see here at the National Cancer Institute has been through all standard treatments that haven't worked. And they come here to the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, of Hope, trying to see if some experimental treatments might be of help to them.\"",
      "In late May, Natalie Phelps finally qualified for Rosenberg's clinical trial. But budget cuts at NIH had already slowed the trial down. NIH has lost about 1,500 employees.",
      "\"We did lose two technicians that are involved in producing the materials that are used to treat patients,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "\"And would that cause a significant delay?\" I asked. \"When I say 'significant,' I mean in Natalie's case she feels that it has been delayed by a month. Is that correct?\"",
      "\"That's correct.\"",
      "\"A month could be critical for her.\"",
      "\"It certainly can when you have metastatic cancer that's growing,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "That one-month delay means Natalie's specialized immune cell therapy won't be ready until late July. I said to her, \"I don't even know what seems like an appropriate question. You must be devastated.\"",
      "\"Well, yeah, Ted,\" she replied. \"I was diagnosed in 2020 during COVID, after giving birth to my second child. And I had to spend the first bit of my child's life changing diapers and doing bottles with the chemotherapy pump attached to me. I've done 48 rounds of chemotherapy. I've had multiple aggressive surgeries and radiation. And I have been in treatment for five years, hoping that I can raise her, but at the very least let her have a memory of who her mother was.",
      "\"I have endured so much, and now I have another hurdle just because of funding cuts?\" she said. \"I mean, my husband and I can't believe it. When is cancer political?\"",
      "In a recent online statement, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya pushed back on concerns about budget cuts and employee layoffs. He said, \"As to the current re-organization, no clinical trial has been delayed, nor has any participant been dropped from any clinical trial\u2026\"",
      "Natalie Phelps is just one patient, one case out of many; but her participation in a clinical trial was delayed, because two specialized technicians were let go.",
      "And that delay has proved to be devastating. She sent us a video message a couple of days ago from NIH:",
      "\"I got my test results back today and I didn't pass,\" she said. \"I have several new brain tumors, and it's not safe for me to participate in the trial. The earliest I could get back here for treatment would be about six weeks after having the tumors radiated, provided that the radiation's successful. I don't know. It's a long time.\"",
      "As for the budget cuts that caused the layoffs that produced the delay, it probably won't help much to learn that they were nothing personal.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 13:32:21 -0400",
    "summary": "RFK Jr. announced a halt to all U.S. funding for the global Gavi vaccine alliance. One expert calls it a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Every four years, representatives to the global alliance of governments, pharmaceutical makers, United Nations agencies and philanthropic organizations known as Gavi, which helps get vaccines to people who need them, meet to lock in new funding pledges. Just as this year's meeting in Brussels was drawing to a close on Wednesday, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that all funding from Washington would cease.",
      "In a three-and-a-half-minute video message that Kennedy\u00a0shared on social media, he said the Trump administration was halting funding to the organization because it had \"neglected the key issue of vaccine safety.\"",
      "Kennedy, who has sought to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, has a history of making\u00a0misleading statements about\u00a0vaccine safety and has been tied to\u00a0anti-vaccine activism groups.",
      "Gavi says it has helped vaccinate more than 1.1 billion children in 78 low income countries and prevented more than 18.8 million deaths since its creation 25 years ago. Its focus is getting vaccines, especially new vaccines, to populations that would struggle to afford them or access them otherwise.",
      "Kennedy argued in the video that GAVI \"has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,\" and that \"when vaccine safety issues have come before Gavi, Gavi has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.\"",
      "Kennedy accused GAVI of ignoring the science and said the alliance must \"justify the $8 billion the U.S. has given it since 2001.\"",
      "The U.S. has long been among the top government contributors to Gavi's funding, which also comes from private organizations.",
      "The Biden administration had committed to $1.6 billion in funding for the organization from 2026 through 2030 \u2014 an amount roughly equal to the funding pledged by the private Gates Foundation \u2014 and shock and outrage reverberated across the conference in Brussels after Kennedy's announcement.",
      "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and the Gates Foundation, said on social media that the move would have \"devastating consequences.\" He called on the U.S. Congress to keep funding Gavi, warning that if it did not, \"more sick kids will fall behind in school,\" and there would be \"more overcrowded hospital wards and eventually more grieving parents.\"",
      "\"If Congress allows this to happen, the consequences will be devastating,\" Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said. \"Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of preventable deaths will occur, especially among mothers and children.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, a public health researcher and surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who previously held a seat on the Gavi board, said Kennedy would be held personally responsible for the results of halted U.S. government funding, which he called a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
      "\"I would expect to see significant changes and reductions in access to safe and effective vaccines to children, in the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world,\" one U.S. official with decades of experience in global health and vaccination programs told CBS News on the condition of anonymity. \"Kennedy's rhetoric on vaccine safety is not helpful and is likely to fuel vaccine hesitancy in the minds of people across the world, where we will surely now see more uncontrolled outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This is very unfortunate.\"",
      "The U.N.'s World Health Organization has warned since 2019 that vaccine hesitancy and mistrust is one of the leading threats to global public health.",
      "The goal of this year's conference was to secure funding to reach the organization's target of over 90% global coverage with essential vaccines for a wide range of diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and measles. Gavi received more than $9 billion in funding commitments on Wednesday, but it had hoped to garner $11.9 billion for the next five years, with the goal of immunizing 500 million children globally.",
      "Other countries acknowledged Gavi's importance, and increased their contributions at the conference on Wednesday.",
      "Topping that list was the U.K.",
      "British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced $1.7 billion for the coming five years, making the U.K. Gavi's new largest donor.",
      "Ghana's President John Darami Mahama, addressing the Gavi conference on Wednesday, began by detailing his younger brother's struggle with polio, and the stigma associated with the disease, which has been virtually eradicated worldwide thanks to vaccination programs launched in the late 1980s.",
      "\"I understand the importance of vaccines,\" Mahama told the delegations.",
      "When his brother was diagnosed, vaccine access in Ghana was close to zero, but the president said that, through partnership with Gavi, 97% of the population was now vaccinated.",
      "He said officials were still working to reach the last 3% \u2014   about \"65,000 children who are in remote areas, difficult to reach for life saving vaccines\" \u2014 and that Ghana planned to no longer need Gavi's support by 2030.",
      "Mahama concluded his remarks with a topical comparison, saying: \"One B-2 Spirit Bomber that dropped bombs on Iran cost $2.13 billion,\" and that he had done the math, adding: \"Surely the world can afford the value of four B-2 bombers to save 500 million children. It's a choice we have to make.\"",

      "Redwood was the president of the group now called Children's Health Defense, which lists as its founder Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now oversees the CDC as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Children's Health Defense has sued to curb vaccine requirements, petitioned federal agencies to revoke vaccine authorizations and spread misinformation about vaccines. Kennedy was listed as the group's founder and chairman before becoming the nation's top health official in the second Trump administration.",
      "She is joining the CDC office responsible for overseeing most of the agency's work and data to probe potential safety risks from vaccines, including databases used by health officials to collect and analyze reports from the public and health care systems.",
      "Redwood is expected to be hired as a special government employee, the CDC officials said, a status often afforded to advisers and other temporary experts brought on for specific projects or committees.",
      "The CDC and Redwood did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Redwood is also scheduled to present Thursday to the agency's new roster of outside vaccine advisers, who were replaced earlier this month by Kennedy with his own picks, about her concerns about the vaccine preservative thimerosal causing autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "The CDC and outside groups have debunked fears about thimerosal causing autism in the past. In a report briefly published on the CDC's website before this week's vaccines meeting, the agency cited several studies turning up no evidence of thimerosal causing neurodevelopmental disorders, and warned of significant methodological issues with a handful of studies that did.",
      "\"Considering the breadth of evidence and consistency in results from multiple population-based studies conducted in several countries with various study designs, the evidence does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders,\" the CDC said in its now-deleted report.",
      "Children's Health Defense in the past has criticized the CDC Immunization Safety Office for its efforts to debunk concerns about thimerosal, accusing the office in 2018 of attempting \"to pull the wool over the public's eyes\" about the preservative. Kennedy echoed some of those claims in a post late Tuesday on X.",
      "\"Removing a known neurotoxin from being injected into our most vulnerable populations is a good place to start with Making America Healthy Again,\" Redwood said in prepared slides released by the agency ahead of the Thursday meeting.",
      "Redwood's addition to the agenda sparked a renewed round of criticism for Kennedy, who medical groups worry is dismantling a key component of how the U.S. develops influential vaccine recommendations tied to insurance coverage and federal policies.",
      "\"Even though the prevalence of thimerosal in flu vaccines is low and it hasn't been linked to developmental issues, the public confusion and over ethylmercury remains \u2014 confusion that anti-vaccine activists, such as Lyn Redwood, have sought to stoke,\" the University of Minnesota's Vaccine Integrity Project wrote Monday.",
      "Beyond thimerosal, which the CDC says data suggests is used in less than 0.3% of flu vaccines given to moms during pregnancy, Redwood has raised concerns about other vaccine ingredients.",
      "In an interview with Kennedy published in October last year, Redwood said aluminum had been found in the brains of children with autism at \"some of the highest levels ever documented.\"",

    "summary": "Elon Musk, the world's richest person, reignited his criticism Monday of the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk ramped up his criticism of the massive tax and domestic policy package working its way through the Senate on Monday, suggesting he could support primary challenges against Republicans who vote for the Trump-backed bill.",
      "\"Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!\" the billionaire and onetime Trump ally wrote in a post on X. \"And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.\"",
      "In a separate post, Musk said he will support Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill when it passed the House, leading Mr. Trump to back a primary challenge.",
      "Musk also suggested starting \"a new political party that actually cares about the people\" on Monday, an idea he first floated earlier this month. He said if the bill passes, a new political party \u2014 which he calls the \"America Party\" \u2014 \"will be formed the next day.\"",
      "Musk's latest swipes came as the Senate worked to advance the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, holding a marathon series of amendment votes on Monday. The Senate still needs to vote on final passage, and the House will need to approve the Senate's changes, before a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the bill to Mr. Trump's desk.",
      "It's unclear how serious Musk is about the apparent threat to back primary challenges against supporters of the legislation \u2014 or what support, if any, he could offer to challengers. But it suggests Musk could remain involved in politics, after spending upwards of $250 million to help elect Mr. Trump and other Republicans last year. The Tesla CEO indicated last month he planned to dial back his political spending for now, saying, \"I think I've done enough.\"",
      "The vast majority of House and Senate Republicans have backed the bill, though some lawmakers have withheld their support, objecting to its Medicaid cuts or arguing it doesn't go far enough to slash spending. Mr. Trump has applied intense pressure to Republicans and lashed out at the remaining holdouts: In a statement last weekend, the White House said \"failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "Musk has railed against the legislation on and off for weeks. The billionaire blasted the bill in early June, calling it a \"disgusting abomination\" \u2014 igniting a dayslong feud between President Trump and the world's richest man that seemed to signal the end of a once close partnership.",
      "The billionaire, who once led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, backed down in mid-June and acknowledged some of his attacks on Mr. Trump \"went too far.\" He remained fairly quiet about the legislation for weeks, but his criticism has intensified in recent days, as lawmakers rush to finalize the bill by the end of the week.",
      "Mr. Trump largely brushed off the feud with Musk in an interview with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that aired Sunday, calling the billionaire a \"wonderful guy\" who \"got a little bit upset, and that wasn't appropriate.\"",

      "Those provisions could directly impact Musk's electric carmaker, Tesla. The phaseout of electric vehicle tax credits may cost the company $1.2 billion, an analysis by JPMorgan Chase estimated. Tesla's solar power and energy storage businesses also benefit from government incentives, and ending those programs \"may harm our business\" by \"making our products less competitive for customers,\" the company disclosed in an annual report filed earlier this year.",

    "summary": "GE Applicances joins the list of companies investing in U.S. manufacturing in new tariff environment under President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "GE Appliances executive Lee Lagomarcino said U.S. trade policy was the driving factor in the company's recent decision to accelerate a plan to move overseas jobs back to the U.S.",
      "\"Any time we decide to move a factory or redesign a platform, it's an expensive endeavor, so we have to think through the strategy and trajectory of market,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in discussing GE Appliances' move to expedite a shift in production of its washers and dryers from China to the U.S. in order to avoid having to pay\u00a0stiffer tariffs.",
      "\"This was the right time to strike on the business opportunity given the environment with tariffs,\" added Lagomarcino, vice president, clothes care, at GE Appliances.",
      "GE Appliances on June 26\u00a0announced it would invest $490 million in a laundry care manufacturing plant in Kentucky that would create 800 new American jobs. In a statement last week, GE Appliances CEO Kevin Nolan said the reshoring effort \"aligns with the current economic and policy environment.\"",
      "The company, which has long planned to reshore manufacturing to the U.S., said that high levies on\u00a0imports from China\u00a0under Mr. Trump have impelled the household appliance maker to \"accelerate the decision-making,\" Lagomarcino, GE Appliances' vice president of clothes care, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Once the plant is fully up and running, the company, a Haier subsidiary, will cease manufacturing in China. \"That factory will turn off when the factory in Louisville, Kentucky turns on,\" said Lagomarcino, adding that he expects the Kentucky plant to be operational by early 2027.",
      "What jobs is GE creating in the U.S.?",
      "The company is looking to fill research and development, engineering and supply chain positions at the Kentucky plant, openings for which it's already started posting on its careers site.",
      "\"We anticipate a lot of hiring for some skilled trades, and technically advanced manufacturing roles,\" Lagomarcino said. \"Our research and development team leader will need to hire more engineers, and our supply chain leader will have to hire to fill jobs.\"",
      "Why now?",
      "The investment in domestic manufacturing comes as a host of U.S. companies\u00a0announce plans\u00a0to reshore operations as they face added costs from Mr. Trump's tariff agenda.",
      "But the main force behind the production move to Louisville is GE's \"zero distance\" philosophy of building appliances where they are sold, the company said in the announcement.",
      "\"U.S. manufacturing allows us to be closer to the consumer and the team that designs and markets the products and is involved in the whole product development lifecycle,\" said Lagormarcino. \"Philosophically, and from a manufacturing and design standpoint, it makes sense.\"",
      "That said, the move makes even more sense with tariff increases in place, according to Lagormarcino.",
      "\"With tariffs or without tariffs, we think it's a good long-term strategy. But when you add tariffs, they introduce costs to the situation, and it does accelerate those actions,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 17:59:31 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists warned that a barrage of new U.S. tariffs could trigger a renewed bout of inflation. So why aren't prices surging?",
    "story": [
      "Despite concerns earlier this year that President Trump's tariffs would cause a renewed bout of inflation, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have remained relatively stable.",
      "The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.3% in May, modestly above the central bank's 2% annual target. The May Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.4%, cooler than economists expected.",
      "The muted inflation data reflects short-term steps taken by some companies to offset the tariff impact, such as pre-ordering inventory, absorbing the cost of some tariffs to cushion consumers from price hikes, and leveraging loopholes to delay or lower duty payments, economists say.",
      "\"Many businesses have been creative and savvy in using different means to buffer the initial shock,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That doesn't mean consumers and businesses, who were battered by the highest inflation in decades during the pandemic, are out of the woods. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, thinks prices are likely to rise as tariffs gradually push up import costs in the second half of the year.",
      "\"We still think in next few months we'll continue to see the impact of the new trade policies on price levels, and they should translate into higher inflation,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Here are three reasons why tariffs haven't driven up inflation as much as many economists expected, at least for now.",
      "Aggressive \"front-loading\"",
      "After the Trump administration announced a range of tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico and dozens of other countries earlier this year, many companies scrambled to stock up, or front-load, on products, parts and other imports to\u00a0avoid incurring added tariff costs.",
      "\"They tried to front-run the imposition of the duties by importing rapidly,\" Daco said. \"They bought goods they needed and stocked them, so that was the first line of defense against the tariffs.\"",
      "Much of that extra inventory remains in warehouses or on store shelves, allowing importers to delay price hikes.",
      "\"Lots of retailers pre-ordered inventory before the tariffs went into effect, so the inventory they're selling has not been marked up yet,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waiting for clarity",
      "Some businesses facing higher tariffs are choosing to hold off on passing any cost increases through to consumers\u00a0as they wait for the fog around U.S. trade policy to lift.",
      "The Trump administration in April froze most of its tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, with that pause due to expire on July 9. And after announcing tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports earlier this year, Mr. Trump and Chinese officials on Thursday said the two countries have agreed on the framework for a trade deal.",
      "\"We have had literally dozens of changes in tariff policy in the last five months. In that highly uncertain environment, companies that sell items that are subject to tariff may be cautious about raising prices immediately,\" Charley Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Companies often refrain from raising prices to avoid scaring away consumers and losing market share to competitors.",
      "Added Daco: \"Essentially, some business decided to not immediately pass on the cost. They said, 'Let's see if we can hold out for a month, delay some imports, use the inventory on hand and be creative in terms of our broader pricing strategy'.\"",
      "Although tariffs are paid by importers, which typically pass those costs on to consumers, some foreign exporters have also been willing to take a hit.",
      "Lower tariff costs",
      "Although Mr. Trump has announced sky-high tariff rates, the actual duties collected at the U.S. border so far are lower than the official rates. That's because some importers have been able to skirt the levies by storing goods in so-called bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones.",
      "Businesses can use bonded warehouses, which are usually located near major commercial ports, to temporarily store goods, components and other inputs without immediately having to pay tariffs or taxes.",
      "\"If you make use of a warehouse or so-called foreign trade zone, you are able to delay the payment of tariffs until these goods are put into commerce,\" Daco said. \"So it's a free-trade zone, or imaginary area that is not subject to tariffs.\"",
      "Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a number of tariff exemptions and exclusions. In practice, that has resulted in the actual levies on imports often being lower than the nominal rate initially announced by the White House.",
      "As of June, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports was around 10%, compared with an official average tariff rate of 15%.",
      "Still, business can't hold the line on price hikes indefinitely if tariffs remain elevated, experts say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0told lawmakers this week\u00a0that tariffs could yet spark higher inflation, likely starting this summer,",
      "\"Part of that is due to the start-stop nature of the tariffs that have been introduced,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For us it's a question of patience more than a mystery as to where it is,\" he added. \"The typical pass-through takes some time. We expect July to be when you start to see it more.\"",

      "More than 95% of the fireworks sold in the U.S. come from China, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. And while sales of pyrotechnics have grown in past years as more states and counties loosen restrictions, tariffs have snarled some firework importers' plans this year.",
      "For retailers, the week before July 4 is the busiest time of the year for fireworks sales. In a normal year, shelves would be fully stocked. This year, with a 30% U.S. tariff in place on imports from China, fireworks fans may find a slimmer selection and higher prices.",
      "That's because some importers asked Chinese sellers to halt orders, when sky-high 145% U.S. tariffs were in place on China. A May trade truce between the countries lowered the the levy to 30%.",
      "\"The timing of the tariffs couldn't have hit at a worse time. The majority of U.S. importers told China, 'Do not ship our product, we can't afford to pay,\" Julie Heckman, executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association, told CBS News. \"It's creating a supply-chain problem.",
      "The disruption is leading to fewer choices and higher prices for consumers this Independence Day, \u00a0according to Bill Weimer, vice president of Phantom Fireworks, a major vendor.",
      "\"On about 30% of our products, there's going to be some effect in the price,\" he told CBS News, although he noted that Phantom would absorb at least some of the higher tariff costs and not pass all of it on to consumers.",
      "As U.S. importers put orders on hold, China temporarily halted production of fireworks earlier this year. With the two countries taking steps last week to ease their trade dispute, the longer term impact on fireworks products remains to be seen.",

      "At Northside Hospital Forsyth in Cumming, Georgia, Dr. Douglas Olson, the medical director for the emergency department, said he's seen a roughly 20% increase in heat-related visits since last year across the hospital's five systems. \"Most of the time it's related to occupational heat exposure,\" he said. \"So those people that are working outside for prolonged periods \u2014 it's been pretty rough.\"",
      "The brutal temperatures in Atlanta led the death of one outdoor worker, Olson confirmed.",
      "In Dallas, a mail carrier died after collapsing on his route earlier this month as local temperatures hovered in the 90s, according to CBS News Texas. His death came roughly two years after another Dallas postal worker collapsed and died after the heat index reached 117 degrees.",
      "Federal\u00a0data\u00a0shows that 479 workers in the U.S. died from heat exposure between 2011 to 2022, an average of 40 deaths a year.",
      "People who work outside, such as construction workers, landscapers and utility workers, are more likely to get dehydrated and suffer from heat-related illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What makes such symptoms so dangerous is how quickly they can escalate.",
      "\"People have a sense of what heat-related illness looks like, but a lot of times the symptoms aren't straightforward,\" said Dr. John Purakal, assistant professor in the Duke Department of Emergency Medicine.",
      "It's not only outdoor workers who sometimes must deal with stifling heat. At a June 25 hearing hosted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, representatives for United for Respect raised concerns about the safety of Amazon workers.",
      "In one instance earlier this month, the labor advocacy group said a worker at an Amazon fulfillment center in Florida had to lift heavy freight items inside a trailer for several hours where the temperatures reached 112 degrees and where the water stations were not working properly.",
      "Sam Stephenson, an Amazon spokesperson, pushed back on those claims, saying the company's water fountains are functional and that Amazon has a rotation policy for employees tasked with with unloading heavy items that ensures they have time to rest.",
      "He added that Amazon keeps employees safe through climate control systems in buildings, air conditioning in delivery vans, and access to protective clothing and hydration. Last year, Amazon also\u00a0said it invested $59 million to cool its vans.",
      "UPS, which delivered an average of 22 million packages a day last year, also has previously drawn scrutiny over the temperature of delivery workers' trucks. In a major win for workers, the company in 2023 announced they were adding both air conditioning and fans to their trucks.",

      "\"While we don't publicly share the number of vehicles we purchase, we are prioritizing deployment in the hottest regions,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our existing delivery vehicles have been upgraded with enhanced ventilation, fans, and heat shields to improve comfort and reduce cabin temperatures.\"",
      "Pushing for a federal heat standard",
      "The U.S. has no federal heat safety standards for workers, meaning protections can vary significantly depending on the employer. In the absence of a national set of rules, a handful of\u00a0states\u00a0have introduced their own regulations to protect workers from the heat.",
      "To address the gaps, OSHA in 2024 proposed a\u00a0rule\u00a0that would require employers to create plans to safeguard employees from extreme heat. Among other provisions, it would require employers to make drinking water readily available when the heat index reaches 80 degrees and provide mandatory 15-minute rest breaks when it reaches 90 degrees.",

    "story": [
      "The latest version of the bill containing President Trump's second term agenda would hobble the renewable energy industry with a new excise tax, in addition to speeding up the sunsetting of tax credits and other benefits.",
      "The additional tax on wind and solar projects, which appeared on page 558 in the version of the bill released over the weekend, is estimated to increase consumer energy prices 8% to 10% and would tax clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an\u00a0analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",

      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Politico Monday that she planned to introduce an amendment that would tie eligibility for the wind and solar tax credits to a project's construction start date, rather than its service date. The Senate is currently holding a marathon vote series on\u00a0proposed amendments to the bill.",
      "These wind and solar projects would have to pay the tax if a certain percentage of the value of their materials are sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. The provision is ostensibly designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components would be cost prohibitive, and some data and AI companies \u2014 which require prodigious amounts of energy \u2014 could turn to China or other countries for reliable and affordable power sources, according to clean power experts.",

The most recent expansion contained tax breaks for individuals for electric vehicles, wind and solar development, and energy efficient appliances and provided tax credits for clean electricity-generating projects that went into service from 2023 through the end of 2032.",
      "Both the Senate and the House would end the renewable energy tax credits, but the Senate would accelerate the timeline in the House version, which would end the tax credits for renewable energy projects placed in service after 2028, a year later than the Senate would.",
      "Eliminating the existing tax credits would likely kill up to 72% of the new wind and solar installations that were to be completed in the U.S. over the next decade, according to analysis from Rhodium Group, a research firm.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who until Saturday was silent on the bill after his social media spat with President Trump over the House version, said of the Senate bill that it was \"Utterly insane and destructive.\"",
      "\"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,\" he said in a post on X. And he predicted it would \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\" Musk also said, \"A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.\"",
      "According to Politico, President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to further \"crack down\" on wind and solar energy by phasing out clean energy credits faster, rather than sunsetting the tax incentives more slowly, which moderate senators favored. Some asked for help easing the hit their states would take as a result of cancelled projects, job losses and higher energy prices.",
      "The renewable energy industry, manufacturing unions and even some conservatives also criticized the new tax.",
      "Conservative energy expert Alex Epstein, advocates ending the green tax credits, but he appeared to be taken by surprise by the excise tax, saying in a post on X, \"I just learned about the excise tax and it's definitely not something I would support.\"",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also quickly condemned the tax.",
      "Neil Bradly, the Chamber's executive vice president, said on social media, \"taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables.\u00a0 Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.\"",
      "The North American Building Trades Union, in a statement, called the bill potentially \"the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.\"",
      "\"Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,\" the statement continued. \"In some cases, it worsens the already harmful trajectory of the House-passed language, threatening an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs and over 3 billion work hours, which translates to $148 billion in lost annual wages and benefits.\"",

    "summary": "GOP tax and spending bill would create a tax deduction for workers in tipped occupations. But not all would lower taxes for workers in tipped jobs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's promise to eliminate taxes on worker tips could soon come to fruition as senators try to iron out the final details of a\u00a0massive budget package\u00a0he has dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "One part of the legislation, the centerpiece of the Trump administration's economic agenda, would provide workers who rely on tips for a large share of their income, such as waiters, bartenders and hairdressers, with relief from federal income tax on those tips.",
      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",
      "How would \"no tax on tips\" work?",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate versions\u00a0of the tax and spending bill vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who would benefit?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all would benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants would qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees would not despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

      "In a lawsuit filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the athletic and lifestyle apparel company claims that certain Costco products imitate its own designs so closely that it constitutes \"trade dress\" infringement, which occurs when a product mimics another so closely that it confuses consumers.",
      "The apparel company claims that Costco's \"knockoff\" designs, or product \"dupes,\" violate trademark law because \"some customers incorrectly believe these infringing products are authentic Lululemon apparel.\" In other cases, \"customers specifically purchase the infringing products because they are difficult to distinguish from authentic Lululemon products,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "\"Indeed, one of the purposes of selling 'dupes' is to confuse consumers at the point-of-sale and/or observers post-sale into believing that the 'dupes' are Plaintiffs' authentic products when they are not,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Lululemon refers to itself in the lawsuit as a \"path-breaking\" apparel company that has set a new standard for performance athletic wear, adding that its \"construction techniques\" and \"strategic fits\" help it stand out to consumers. Reached for comment, the Vancouver, Canada-based company said it fiercely defends its products.",
      "\"As an innovation-led company that invests significantly in the research, development and design of our products, we take the responsibility of protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights very seriously and pursue the appropriate legal action when necessary,\" a Lululemon company spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Costco did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "While copycat products can be so poorly constructed and designed that they pose no threat to the originals, Costco's dupes have caused a stir for their verisimilitude to the authentic Lululemon goods.

      "The Starbucks rival opened its first two stores in New York City on Monday, as the Xiamen-based coffee purveyor sets out to expand its market and garner favor with U.S. customers. The two Manhattan storefronts are located at 755 Broadway in Greenwich Village and 800 6th Ave in Chelsea.",
      "The Chinese company first announced its U.S. arrival last week,\u00a0posting on Instagram, \"Drip level: International. The rumors are true, NYC. You're luckin now.\" Since then, the chain has been teasing \"soft openings\" on its social media accounts, offering promotional deals to get customers in the door.",
      "Luckin did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Rapid growth in Asia",
      "Since launching in 2017, Luckin has scaled rapidly to over 24,000 stores, with locations in China, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, according to a recent financial report. Despite hiccups, including an accounting fraud scandal, and $475 million in losses last year as the company poured hundreds of millions of dollars into coffee beans, store rent and other costs, Luckin's profit margins have rapidly ballooned. This past quarter, the coffee chain made $1.2 million in revenue, a 41% increase from the year prior.",
      "The store's app-based concept, contrived by founder Jenny Zhiya Qian, was intended to echo that of a ride-hailing business, according to an analysis by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",
      "To purchase an item, Luckin customers browse the coffee store's menu and make payments directly online. This is a \"100% cashier-less environment,\" Luckin states\u00a0on its website, adding that the app-based store model is intended to maximize efficiency and keep costs low. The company's beverages in China are 30% cheaper than Starbucks beverages in the country, according to CNN.",
      "Luckin's menu offers a range of drinks from traditional items like matcha and lattes to more unconventional choices like its \"fruity Americano\" series. It also has a small pastry menu including a banana yogurt loaf,\u00a0 chocolate-chip cookie and a sausage, egg and cheese croissant, among other offerings.",
      "Competition with Starbucks",
      "Luckin's entr\u00e9e into the U.S. coffee market is a direct challenge to Starbucks, which is in the midst of revamping its brand image through the \"Back to Starbucks\" campaign as it struggles against declining sales and revenue.",
      "With more than 17,000\u00a0locations across the country, Starbucks has the upper hand in the U.S. In China, however, the Seattle-based coffee giant lost its hold to Luckin in 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported.",
      "Significantly cheaper menu items and a convenient in-app ordering model boded well for Luckin in China, though it remains to be seen if the same exact strategy will be applied in the U.S. market.",
      "A quick glance at Luckin's in-app menu shows that prices on key items are more or less on par with those at U.S. Starbucks stores. A 16-ounce drip coffee at Luckin, for instance, goes for $3.45 compared with $3.65 at Starbucks. A 16-ounce iced matcha, meanwhile, costs $6.45 at Luckin, or 20 cents more than the $6.25 equivalent at Starbucks. A bagel at both companies goes for $3.25.",
      "According to Luckin, the company has over 120 million registered app users. That's far more than Starbucks, which also offers customers the ability to order via app. In January, the Seattle-based company said it had 34 million people in its membership rewards program, which is run through the app and online.",

Additionally, a dozen cities and counties are also set to boost their baseline pay rates next month.",
      "The higher minimum wages come as the federal baseline rate remains at $7.25 an hour, where it's been parked since 2009. As the cost of living has crept higher in subsequent years, some states and municipalities have boosted their own minimum wages through a combination of ballot measures, inflation adjustments and legislation.",
      "\"These minimum wage increases will put more money in workers' pockets, helping many of them and their families make ends meet,\" EPI state economic analyst Sebastian Martinez Hickey wrote in a post about the higher pay. \"The average increase in annual wages for a full-time, year-round worker resulting from these minimum wage hikes ranges from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska.\"",
      "About 58% of the workers who will receive pay hikes are women, while Black and Hispanic workers will also disproportionately benefit, according to the EPI's analysis.",
      "For example, in states where the minimum wage will increase in July, Black workers make up 7% of workers who will receive raises, but only 4.5% of the wage-earning workforce. Similarly, nearly 27% of Hispanic workers will see their wages rise, though they make up just over 13% of the wage-earning workforce.",
      "While the federal minimum wage hasn't budged in 16 years, there have been periodic attempts to boost it, with the latest coming from Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, who earlier this month introduced legislation to increase the national baseline wage to $15 per hour. He was joined by Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch as a co-sponsor.",
      "Pay hikes in Alaska, D.C., and Oregon",
      "Alaska's baseline wage will rise by $1.09 to $13.00 an hour, which was approved via a ballot measure passed by voters. The boost will impact 6.3% of the state's workforce, or 19,400 people, who will see an average annual pay increase of $925, EPI calculates.",
      "In Washington, D.C., 7.5% of the workforce, or 62,200 workers, will benefit from the minimum wage rising by 45 cents to $17.95 an hour, thanks to an inflation adjustment formula. With the new minimum in place, a full-time worker in the nation's capital will earn an additional $727 in annual wages, on average, according to the EPI's calculations.",
      "Oregon's minimum wage will rise 35 cents to $15.05 an hour on July 1, also through an inflation adjustment, boosting pay for 9.4% of the state's workforce, or 801,700 workers. The average pay hike will equate to $420 annually.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 09:57:12 -0400",
    "summary": "He's the son of an immigrant family who fled Tehran and the Iranian revolution. He's also the chief executive officer of Uber. He talks about the road to high-tech success, and about unsettling times for a nation of immigrants.",
    "story": [
      "It's rare to sit down with a CEO and the CEO's mother. The proud mom is Lili Khosrowshahi; her son, Dara, is behind the wheel at Uber as its chief executive. \"I actually say he works for Uber,\" said Lili. \"Sometimes I say he drives, he's a driver.\"",
      "They sat down with us to share their family's immigration story. In 1978, the Khosrowshahis fled Tehran and the Iranian revolution. \"We were forced to leave Iran \u2013 it wasn't our decision,\" Lili said. \"It was done in a day.\"",
      "Dara's father ran a family business which made them wealthy, but also, they say, a target. \"You don't sit around saying, 'Well, let's plan as a family for a revolution,' right? It just never occurs to you,\" Dara said. \"We lost everything.\"",
      "\"We came from a much better life to a smaller life,\" said Lili. \"At the time, coffee was 15 cents, and I wouldn't even buy a cup of coffee. In fact, I don't pay for Starbucks coffee to this day.\"",
      "\"Mama, Starbucks is a customer of Uber Eats. You gotta talk it up!\" Dara interjected. \"I love Starbucks, personally!\"",
      "\"I'll let you pay,\" said Mom.",
      "It's that easy-going, yet strategic tone that Khosrowshahi brought to Uber. Launched in 2009, the company transformed how millions get around. When Khosrowshahi took charge in 2017, Uber was infamous for a toxic work culture and a growth-at-all-costs approach.",
      "When he took over, his job was described as \"one of the worst clean-up jobs in the history of American capitalism.\"",
      "\"Well, I think it was a little over-dramatized,\" said Khosrowshahi. \"But it was true that I had to come in and change the culture of the company. And I do think that the company, in hindsight, was too aggressive in certain ways. And I think now we get it right more than we get it wrong.\"",
      "Still, Uber is defending itself in lawsuits over its billing practices and passenger safety.",
      "Then, there's the company's relationship with President Donald Trump. Eight years ago, Khosrowshahi was CEO of Expedia \u2013 and condemned Mr. Trump's so-called Muslim ban. Today, he's one of many CEOs now engaging with President Trump.",
      "\"I do think that, as a CEO of a U.S. company, you want the country to succeed,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"And so, that means supporting whatever administration is in power. You're gonna have your disagreements. You're gonna have your agreements. We have to navigate through a period of a strong economy, but at the same time, significant uncertainty.\"",
      "I asked, \"Isn't a lot of that uncertainty caused by this president?\"",
      "\"Uncertainty comes with change,\" he replied. \"And I think the president ran on a mandate for change. As CEOs, as companies, you know, we have to adjust to that environment that we see.\"",
      "And Uber is adjusting. Last month it announced new, cheaper ride options. Route Share matches riders with other passengers along pre-set commutes.",
      "\"This feels kind of like a glorified carpool?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, what is old is new again,\" said Khosrowshahi.",
      "\"We have heard from a lot of riders that Uber rides have gotten a lot more expensive over the past few years, more than the rate of inflation \u2013 what's happening here?\"",
      "\"Well, I think it is about inflation,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"And the average Uber ride is now a little over $20. Our drivers need to make a living, and so really the demand for drivers and pay has gone up, and that translates into the ultimate price of the Uber ride.\"",
      "Concerns over driver pay and benefits persist \u2026 even as Khosrowshahi's own compensation has surged, to about $40 million a year.",
      "Asked what people should make of that, Khosrowshahi said, \"We as a society, I think as a country, clearly, we've done unbelievably well economically. But I do think that the inequality that you see as it relates to the top end compensation, like someone who's lucky enough like me, and the middle class, et cetera, that is too big a chasm, in my opinion.\"",
      "Too big of a gap? \"Yeah. I do think it's too big of a gap. Now, I don't have a solution for it.\"",
      "It's a gap that may be getting even bigger.",
      "This past week, Uber expanded its robotaxi service to Atlanta, launching rides in self-driving Waymos.",
      "Khosrowshahi said, \"Everyone wants on-demand transportation, food, et cetera. So, we see actually AV [Autonomous Vehicle] and human driving can grow for the next five to 10 years.\"",
      "\"You don't think human driver numbers will decrease?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not in the next five to 10 years,\" he replied. \"Then, we will need to adjust as a society.\"",
      "For now, robotaxis are neither cheaper nor faster than a human driver. But Khosrowshahi says they are as safe as can be. \"Certainly the statistics bear it out,\" he said.",
      "Khosrowshahi is focused on the road ahead, but his past is never far behind. When he was a teen, his father returned to Iran for what he thought would be a short visit \u2026 but the government wouldn't let him leave.",
      "Lili said, \"For the six years that your father was away, you never even mentioned his name. And I told you that Daddy was free to come, and you started crying like crazy. I mean, you couldn't stop crying. So, you know, you had learned to just hide your feelings. But as immigrants, we all learned to hide our feelings.\"",
      "Emotional, Dara requested a break from the interview. \"I don't remember the particular moment,\" he said. \"but I remember the time. And I think, you know, Mom's totally right. You adjust to the situation to your best.\"",
      "\"Adjust\" \u2026 Dara Khosrowshahi keeps coming back to that word, in work and in life.",
      "I asked, \"You have said, 'We came at a time that was welcoming to immigrants.' Is that still the case right now?\"",
      "\"I think, you know, we're going through a transition now as a nation,\" he replied. \"There's a reset going on in terms of making sure that immigration here is proper, is legal. It's difficult for a lot of people. But my hope is that we remain the kind of country that attracts the best and the brightest who want to build a life here. And  hopefully, I can help others live the same dream that I have.\"",

      "Americans are continually encouraged to sock away money in a 401(k) or other retirement plan to ensure a comfortable, if not cushy, life in their later years. Yet about half of all U.S. workers in the private sector lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, a huge obstacle in building enough wealth to retire, a recent study finds.",
      "About 56 million workers at businesses across the U.S. are unable to save via a retirement plan through their jobs, according to the analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts. And while these employees can in principle save money on their own, many are forced to prioritize putting food on the table and paying the bills in the present over building a nest egg for the future, the study found.",
      "The findings underscore the widening divide between the retirement haves and have-nots, with almost 30% of Americans over age 59 lacking any savings\u00a0to fall back on when they stop working. Employer-sponsored accounts like 401(k)s can help workers save because the money is taken out of paychecks automatically on a pre-tax basis, while many employers also provide a company match, which helps boost savings.",
      "\"Deeply unequal\"",
      "\"Pew's findings confirm what we've known for years: America's retirement system is deeply unequal,\" retirement expert Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and professor at the New School for Social Research, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

The remainder is tucked away in individual retirement accounts, or IRAs.",
      "While it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to these plans said they faced barriers to building wealth, the Pew survey found. For instance, one-third of workers without access to an employer-sponsored retirement account said they didn't have any money left over after the end of the month.",
      "\"To build wealth and achieve financial security, individuals and families need a convenient and effective way to accumulate assets,\" Pew noted in its analysis. \"Research shows that individuals are 15 times more likely to save for retirement if money is deducted automatically from their paychecks.\"",
      "Other researchers have highlighted the gaping holes in the American retirement system. For example, one 2023 analysis from the Economic Innovation Group found that 70% of low-income workers, or those earning $37,000 or less, lack employer-sponsored plans.",
      "Creaking Social Security system",
      "While financial gurus often exhort Americans to prepare for the time they can no longer work, the Pew research makes clear that people without access to a retirement plan face significant hurdles to achieving financial security, Ghilarducci noted.",
      "\"What the Pew report confirms, and what we experts knew for years, is that saving for retirement isn't much about personal responsibility as it is about access,\" she said.",
      "Ghilarducci added, \"Without a workplace plan, even the most disciplined and financially educated worker faces structural disadvantages for saving.\"",
      "The Pew research underscores that millions of Americans will approach their retirement years reliant on Social Security as their primary \u2014 or even only \u2014 source of income in old age. At the same time, the Social Security program is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast.",
      "At that point, roughly 70 million Social Security recipients would see their monthly benefits cut by about 20%. That would likely create financial hardship for the roughly 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who today rely on the program as their sole source of income.",
      "Although lawmakers still have time overhaul the program to strengthen its finances, Congress has yet to take steps to shore up Social Security.",
      "\"The Pew report is a wake-up call,\" Ghilarducci said. \"If Congress fails to act, the people most harmed are those who can least afford it \u2014 workers without retirement accounts and pensions, gig workers, and those earning low wages.\"",

      "Posting on Truth Social\u00a0on Friday afternoon, the president said the U.S. will let Canada know what their tariff rate will be in the next week. The trade talks blowup comes only a week after the president met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the Group of Seven\u00a0economic summit in Alberta.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the Federal Communications Commission's multi-billion-dollar mechanism for expanding phone and internet access to rural and low-income communities.",
      "The high court ruled that neither Congress nor the FCC violated the Constitution with its chosen scheme for administering the Universal Service Fund, which is supported by contributions from communications carriers and funds programs designed to improve access to telecommunications services.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan authored the majority opinion for the 6-3 court, with Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in dissent.",
      "\"For nearly three decades, the work of Congress and the Commission in establishing universal-service programs has led to a more fully connected country. And it has done so while leaving fully intact the separation of powers integral to our Constitution,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "With its decision, the high court passed on an opportunity to revive a long-dormant legal concept known as the nondelegation doctrine, which some conservative justices have in recent years expressed support for revisiting.",
      "Rooted in the separation of powers, the doctrine restricts Congress from delegating its legislative powers to executive branch agencies. A conservative nonprofit called Consumers' Research challenged the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund, arguing that Congress' delegation of power to the FCC and the FCC's delegation to a private corporation that sets carriers' contribution rates was unlawful.",
      "But the Supreme Court rejected the group's challenge and found that the Universal Service Fund does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.",
      "Established by the FCC after Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Universal Service Fund aims to ensure communications systems are available nationwide. Carriers pay into the fund and the contributions are used to subsidize phone and internet services to low-income customers, rural and high-cost areas and to schools, libraries and rural health care providers.",
      "The FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company in 1997 to administer the fund and determine the amount carriers have to pay into it. The not-for-profit corporation also disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "Fees are set based on a percentage of a carriers' revenue, and telecommunications companies pass on their share to consumers. The program collects nearly $10 billion annually, according to the administrator.",
      "More than 12,000 schools and libraries, and more than 9,000 rural health care providers have benefited from initiatives backed by the Universal Service Fund, and more than 8 million low-oncome households have been served.",

      "The plaintiffs argued that the fund is unlawful because Congress unconstitutionally delegated its authority to the FCC, which in turn transferred power to the Universal Service Administrative Company. The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit sided with Consumers' Research and found that the combination of Congress' delegation to the FCC, and the commission's subdelegation to the fund administrator violates the Constitution.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy shrank faster than previously thought during the first three months of 2025, with growth contracting for the first time in three years.",
      "The country's gross domestic product fell at an annual rate of 0.5% from January through March, the Commerce Department reported Thursday in its third and final GDP report\u00a0for the period. The agency's\u00a0initial first-quarter GDP report, issued in April, estimated a 0.3% decline, which was later revised to a 0.2% dip in its second print.",
      "First-quarter growth was weighed down by a surge of imports as U.S. companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs went into effect. Although a surge in imports can appear to lower economic growth because it shows a shift away from domestic consumption, that doesn't tell the whole story about the U.S. economy, experts say.",
      "A category within the GDP data called \"real final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which measures the economy's underlying strength, rose at a 1.9% annual rate from January through March. While that represents a solid number, it's down from the 2.9% pace in the fourth quarter of 2024 and from the Commerce Department's previous estimate of 2.5% January-March growth.",
      "The new data also shows that consumers sharply pared spending earlier this year, with growth at 0.5%, down from a robust 4% during the last three months of 2024. First-quarter consumer spending fell to its lowest level since the pandemic ended, with Americans particularly cutting back on recreation and dining, Greg Daco, EY-Parthenon chief economist, said in a research note.",
      "\"What we're witnessing is an economy temporarily buffered from the tariff shock by smart logistics maneuvers, proactive pricing strategies and some foreign exporter concessions,\" Daco said.",
      "On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a House committee that businesses' rush to build their inventories earlier this year ahead of tariffs taking effect has helped delay any inflationary impacts from the import duties.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by domestic importers, all or some of the costs are typically passed onto consumers. Stocking up on inventory early in the year has allowed companies to sell those goods without the added costs of tariffs, Powell noted.",
      "\"The things that are being sold at retail now, they might have been put into inventory before the tariffs in February or March,\" the Fed chief said. \"We think we should start to see this over the summer, in the June numbers and in the July numbers.\"",
      "Second-quarter rebound?",
      "The category of real final sales to private domestic purchasers includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics called the decline in that figure \"troubling,\u2033 though he doesn't expect to make a significant change to his near-term economic forecast.",
      "Sweet noted that he'll be looking Friday's release of personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, because it will \"show how the revisions impacted the trajectory of consumption headed into this quarter.\"",
      "The PCE, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, shows household spending on goods and services.",
      "Economists are forecasting that the first-quarter's influx in imports won't be repeated in the second quarter, which spans April through June, and shouldn't weigh on GDP during the period.",
      "Economic growth is forecast to bounce back to 3% in the second quarter, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The Commerce Department will release its first estimate of second-quarter GDP on July 30.",

      "The settlement was first\u00a0announced in December 2022. At the time, it marked the FTC's largest ever refund in a gaming industry case. The agency said at the time that Epic deceived consumers into making in-game purchases they would otherwise not have made.",

    "summary": "Republicans released an updated version of the legislation late Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Republicans released the latest version of President Trump's massive spending and tax bill late Friday as the GOP eyes an ambitious July 4 deadline to approve the centerpiece legislation of the president's second-term agenda.",
      "After the House narrowly approved the legislation that addresses the president's tax, defense, border and energy priorities last month, Senate Republicans have been putting their imprint on the bill. But GOP leaders are seeking a middle ground to appease the upper chamber without alienating House Republicans, who will have to approve the Senate's changes before the bill can head to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "The Senate voted Saturday to advance the measure, overcoming a key hurdle as the upper chamber works toward final passage, and will vote on amendments and then the overall bill on Monday.",
      "At the center of the bill is an extension to Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, slated to sunset at year's end, seeking to make the cuts permanent in what has been a key priority for Senate Republicans. It also includes increased spending for border security, defense and energy production, which are offset in part by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs.",
      "But along with different dynamics in the Senate, Republicans have also been contending with input from the Senate's rulekeeper, known as the parliamentarian. She has been weighing in on the bill's components to determine whether they may fly under the reconciliation process, which allows the GOP to move forward with the bill without any support from across the aisle.",
      "Here's what's in the Senate's updated version of the \"big, beautiful bill,\" some of which remains in flux:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. Like the House-passed bill, the legislation imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. But the Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, isn't in compliance with Senate rules.",
      "The parliamentarian also weighed in on the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in the Senate in recent weeks. It's a departure from the House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $25 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The Senate bill still shifts the costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "However, Alaska and Hawaii would receive temporary exemptions from the cost-sharing requirement. Both states would receive a two-year reprieve if the Department of Agriculture determines they are \"actively implementing a corrective action plan.\"",
      "The package also aligns with the House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18-64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could also receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the House-passed bill, as Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, outlining that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress are aiming to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the Senate bill, $300 less than the House-passed hike. The House version reverts the increase to $2,000 after 2028.",
      "Limits on overtime and tips deductions",
      "The bill would allow individuals to deduct up to $25,000 for tip wages and $12,500 for overtime. But the provisions would expire in 2028. The Senate bill would reduce the deductions for individuals making over $150,000, while the House bill does not include income limits.",
      "Changes to standard deduction",
      "The Senate wants to permanently expand the basic standard deduction, which was nearly doubled in 2017. The increases will expire at the end of the year. The House bill, however, would expand the deduction only through 2028.",
      "Asylum fee",
      "The legislation also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum and other fees on diversity immigrant visas.",
      "Pause on AI regulations",
      "A revised proposal on a pause on state regulations on artificial intelligence also made it into the Senate bill. The original provision called for a 10-year moratorium, but Republicans reached a compromise over the weekend that says states can only access $500 million in federal funds for AI infrastructure if they don't regulate the technology for five years. The compromise also includes exemptions to protect the safety of children online.",

The vote on the motion to proceed stayed open for more than three hours as holdouts sought assurances from GOP leaders. Some tweaks were made to the bill before Republicans ultimately received enough votes to move forward.",
      "Senate Democrats further delayed the legislation's path forward by forcing the bill to be read in its entirety, starting late Saturday. After nearly 16 hours, the Senate clerks concluded their reading of the bill on the floor, starting the clock on debate. Each side then had up to 10 hours for debate.",
      "The \"vote-a-rama\"",
      "Following debate, and a break until the morning, the Senate began what's known as a \"vote-a-rama\" Monday in which senators may offer an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to cast vote after vote. Democrats have been using the opportunity to put their GOP colleagues on the record on a number of controversial issues ahead of the midterm elections.",
      "But before the chamber could get to the amendment votes, senators had to address an outstanding disagreement over the current policy baseline, an accounting approach that would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing. Senate Majority Leader John Thune maneuvered Sunday to allow the use of the current policy baseline, before Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer quickly appealed the move, requesting a vote as Democrats railed against it as the \"nuclear option.\" The chamber voted 53-47, along party lines, to affirm the use of the current policy baseline on Monday.",
      "Schumer said that Democrats would bring \"one amendment after the other\" Monday, and began the process by offering an amendment to send the bill back to the Finance Committee to revisit some of its health care provisions. The chamber voted down the amendment in a party-line vote.",
      "Democrats proposed a number of amendments to attempt to roll back some of the bill's more controversial provisions. Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, proposed an amendment to remove the bill's provisions that he said would force rural hospitals to limit their services or close their doors. And Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, proposed an amendment to eliminate what he called \"red tape\" around Medicaid eligibility. Other amendments proposed by Democrats concerned cuts to food assistance and state provider taxes, among a number of related issues. The amendments fell short.",
      "GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas offered the first Republican-led amendment, which would have reduced federal Medicaid expansion payments to states that provide coverage to undocumented immigrants charged with specific crimes. The Senate's rulemaker, known as the parliamentarian, determined that the provision would require a 60-vote threshold. The amendment fell short, though it picked up support from a handful of Democrats.",
      "Amid the slew of votes, anticipation swirled around a consequential amendment expected to be put forward by GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida later Monday. The amendment would significantly reduce the federal Medicaid expansion match made under the Affordable Care Act, barring new enrollees after 2030, in a move that would make the bill more palatable to some fiscal hawks.",
      "Thune has backed the amendment, calling it \"great policy,\" and forecasted that it will get significant support among the Senate GOP. But whether it has enough support to be added to the bill remains to be seen.",
      "The chamber's pace began to slow Monday evening. As the amendment votes dragged on, Democrats accused Republicans of stalling.",
      "\"They're delaying, they're stalling, they're cutting a lot of back-room deals,\" Schumer told reporters. \"But we're just pushing forward, amendment after amendment \u2014 they don't like these amendments.\"",
      "The path to passage",
      "Senate Republicans have been pursuing the legislation through the budget reconciliation process, which enables the party in the majority to move ahead without support from across the aisle. With only a simple majority required to advance the measure, rather than the 60-votes needed to move forward with most legislation, Senate Democrats have few mechanisms to combat the bill's progress.",
      "With a 53-seat majority, Senate GOP leaders can only afford to lose support from three Republicans \u2014 and would then still require a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance. And although a number of senators who had expressed opposition to the measure ultimately decided to advance it Saturday, how they will vote on the measure in a final form remains unclear.",
      "Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina were the two Republicans to oppose the bill's advancement Saturday, and are expected to oppose the legislation on final passage. Tillis, who announced Sunday that he is not seeking reelection, took to the Senate floor that night to outline his opposition to some of the bill's cuts to Medicaid, claiming \"Republicans are about to make a mistake on health care\" and arguing that the GOP is \"betraying our promise.\"",
      "\"It is inescapable that this bill in its current form will betray the very promise that Donald J. Trump made\" to target only waste, fraud and abuse in the entitlement program, Tillis said, claiming that the president has been \"misinformed\"",
      "The North Carolina Republican argued that the July 4 deadline is an \"artificial\" one, saying Senate Republicans are rushing, while encouraging the chamber to \"take the time to get this right\" and align more closely with the House's Medicaid provisions.",
      "But Senate GOP leaders are still moving ahead. Thune, a South Dakota Republican, delivered a defense of the bill on the Senate floor ahead of the vote-a-rama Monday, pushing back on criticism over Medicaid cuts, the impact on the deficit and the use of the current policy baseline.",
      "\"Let's vote,\" Thune said. \"This is good for America.\"",
      "When asked whether he's confident Senate Republicans have the votes to pass the legislation, the majority leader told reporters, \"Never, until we vote.\"",
      "Vance was on hand to break a possible tie vote Saturday, though his vote ultimately wasn't needed. Still, the vice president met with GOP holdouts in the majority leader's office Saturday as the White House put pressure on lawmakers to get the bill across the finish line.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that the president has \"been in touch with lawmakers all weekend long to get this bill passed.\"",
      "\"The White House and the president are adamant that this bill is passed and that this bill makes its way to his desk,\" Leavitt said. \"Republicans need to stay tough and unified during the home stretch, and we are counting on them to get the job done.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, warned Sunday that the legislation would be a \"political albatross\" for Republicans, while suggesting that the bill could even lose support among the GOP, saying \"it's not over until it's over.\"",
      "\"I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this, and we'll see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their conviction,\" Warner said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk ramped up his criticism of the massive tax and domestic policy package working its way through the Senate on Monday, suggesting he could support primary challenges against Republicans who vote for the Trump-backed bill.",
      "\"Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!\" the billionaire and onetime Trump ally wrote in a post on X. \"And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.\"",
      "In a separate post, Musk said he will support Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill when it passed the House, leading Mr. Trump to back a primary challenge.",
      "Musk also suggested starting \"a new political party that actually cares about the people\" on Monday, an idea he first floated earlier this month. He said if the bill passes, a new political party \u2014 which he calls the \"America Party\" \u2014 \"will be formed the next day.\"",
      "Musk's latest swipes came as the Senate worked to advance the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, holding a marathon series of amendment votes on Monday. The Senate still needs to vote on final passage, and the House will need to approve the Senate's changes, before a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the bill to Mr. Trump's desk.",
      "It's unclear how serious Musk is about the apparent threat to back primary challenges against supporters of the legislation \u2014 or what support, if any, he could offer to challengers. But it suggests Musk could remain involved in politics, after spending upwards of $250 million to help elect Mr. Trump and other Republicans last year. The Tesla CEO indicated last month he planned to dial back his political spending for now, saying, \"I think I've done enough.\"",
      "The vast majority of House and Senate Republicans have backed the bill, though some lawmakers have withheld their support, objecting to its Medicaid cuts or arguing it doesn't go far enough to slash spending. Mr. Trump has applied intense pressure to Republicans and lashed out at the remaining holdouts: In a statement last weekend, the White House said \"failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "Musk has railed against the legislation on and off for weeks. The billionaire blasted the bill in early June, calling it a \"disgusting abomination\" \u2014 igniting a dayslong feud between President Trump and the world's richest man that seemed to signal the end of a once close partnership.",
      "The billionaire, who once led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, backed down in mid-June and acknowledged some of his attacks on Mr. Trump \"went too far.\" He remained fairly quiet about the legislation for weeks, but his criticism has intensified in recent days, as lawmakers rush to finalize the bill by the end of the week.",
      "Mr. Trump largely brushed off the feud with Musk in an interview with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that aired Sunday, calling the billionaire a \"wonderful guy\" who \"got a little bit upset, and that wasn't appropriate.\"",
      "Why is Musk opposed to Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\"?",
      "Many of Musk's criticisms zero in on the bill's price tag, calling its spending levels \"insane\" and attacking a provision in the Senate version of the bill that hikes the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.",
      "But the billionaire has also panned the bill's cuts to green energy tax credits and excise tax on certain renewable energy projects, calling those provisions \"utter madness\" that could \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country.\"",
      "Those provisions could directly impact Musk's electric carmaker, Tesla. The phaseout of electric vehicle tax credits may cost the company $1.2 billion, an analysis by JPMorgan Chase estimated. Tesla's solar power and energy storage businesses also benefit from government incentives, and ending those programs \"may harm our business\" by \"making our products less competitive for customers,\" the company disclosed in an annual report filed earlier this year.",

    "summary": "President Trump previously said diplomatic talks could resume as early as this week, but Iran's foreign minister said he didn't think they would \"restart as quickly as that.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump recently indicated diplomatic talks with Iran could restart as soon as this week, although the White House noted no talks were officially scheduled. After U.S. airstrikes on some of Iran's nuclear facilities, followed days later by a\u00a0ceasefire to end what Mr. Trump called the\u00a012-day war between Iran and Israel, Iran's foreign minister seemed less certain about a speedy return to diplomacy.",
      "\"I don't think negotiations will restart as quickly as that,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CBS News through a translator.",
      "\"In order for us to decide to reengage, we will have to first ensure that America will not revert back to targeting us in a military attack during the negotiations,\" Araghchi said in his first interview with an American media outlet inside Iran since the bombings. \"And I think with all these considerations, we still need more time.\"",
      "However, Araghchi also insisted, \"The doors of diplomacy will never slam shut.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said during a televised address following the American strikes on June 21 that Iran's Fordo nuclear enrichment site and the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear facilities had been \"completely and totally obliterated.\" Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a news conference, \"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction.\"",
      "Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency\u00a0told CBS News the U.S. strikes caused \"severe damage, but it's not total damage.\" Grossi said Iran could likely start enriching uranium again within a few months.",
      "\"One cannot obliterate the technology and science for enrichment through bombings,\" Araghchi said. \"If there is this will on our part, and the will exists in order to once again make progress in this industry, we will be able to expeditiously repair the damages and make up for the lost time.\"",
      "When asked if Iran intends to continue enriching uranium, Araghchi said the country's \"peaceful nuclear program has turned into a matter of national pride and glory. We have also gone through 12 days of imposed war, therefore, people will not easily back down from enrichment.\"",
      "After 12 days of missile exchanges between Iran and Israel, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared victory, writing on social media, \"I offer my congratulations on the victory over the fallacious Zionist regime,\" and claiming Israel's government was \"practically knocked out and crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded on social media, calling Khamenei's declaration a lie, saying Iran had been \"decimated\" and claiming he prevented both the U.S. and Israeli militaries from assassinating the supreme leader.",
      "Mr. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet at the White House next Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump has also indicated he could order strikes on Iran again should it resume enriching uranium beyond a certain level. Araghchi questioned the legality of such action and said Iran was prepared for more attacks.",
      "\"We showed and proved during this 12-day imposed war that we have the ability to defend ourselves, and we will continue to do so should any aggression be launched against us,\" he said.",

    "summary": "GOP Sen. Mike Lee's plan to allow the sale of public lands ran into bipartisan opposition in the Senate and the House.",
    "story": [
      "Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah announced over the weekend he was removing a provision from the Senate's \"big, beautiful bill\" that would allow the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands for affordable housing and infrastructure.",
      "\"Because of the strict constraints of the budget reconciliation process, I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families\u2014not to China, not to BlackRock, and not to any foreign interests,\" Lee said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0announcing the withdrawal of the provision.",
      "After the Senate parliamentarian ruled that Lee's original proposal, which encompassed millions of acres, would violate budget reconciliation rules, he had reduced the acreage. The bill, which contains President Trump's tax cuts, border and defense initiatives, is being considered under the special rules because it requires only a simple majority to pass, rather than the 60-vote super majority that is required for consideration of most legislation in the Senate.",
      "Under Lee's plan, land in 11 Western states from Alaska to New Mexico would have been eligible for sale. Montana was carved out of the proposal after its lawmakers objected. In states like Utah and Nevada, the government controls the vast majority of lands, protecting them from potential exploitation but hindering growth.",
      "Lee's revised plan would have excluded all U.S. Forest Service land from possible sale. Sales of sites controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management were to be significantly reduced, Lee said, so that only land within 5 miles of population centers could be sold.",
      "But in addition to opposition from Democrats, Republican senators in Idaho and Montana objected to the plan, too. Several House Republicans also said that if the provision were included in the Senate bill, they would vote against it when the bill received a vote in the lower chamber, threatening its passage.",
      "Lee said in his statement that he still believes the federal government \"owns far too much land\u2014land it is mismanaging and in many cases ruining for the next generation\" and he complained that under Democratic presidents, \"massive swaths of the West are being locked away from the people who live there, with no meaningful recourse.\"",
      "The House originally had a public land sales provision, too, one which would have allowed sales of acreage in Utah and Nevada. But GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana, who served as interior secretary during President Trump's first administration, opposed the idea immediately.",
      "\"I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands,\" Zinke said in a statement in May. \"Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn't creating more land.\"",
      "Several other Western state Republican House members also rejected the idea, so the provision was stripped out of the budget bill before the House voted on it.",
      "Housing advocates have cautioned that federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing. Some of the parcels up for sale in Utah and Nevada under the House proposal were many miles from developed areas.",
      "New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee, said before Lee withdrew his plan that it would exclude Americans from places where they fish, hunt and camp.",
      "\"I don't think it's clear that we would even get substantial housing as a result of this,\" Heinrich said earlier this month. \"What I know would happen is people would lose access to places they know and care about and that drive our Western economies.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal magistrate judge said Monday that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and then was returned to the United States to face criminal charges of human smuggling, will remain in federal custody until at least mid-July.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers had asked the judge Friday to delay his release, warning that the Trump administration had made conflicting statements about whether he will be deported after he is released ahead of a trial.",
      "The brief order from U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes is the latest development in the case involving Abrego Garcia, whose removal to El Salvador in March emerged as a flashpoint in President Trump's immigration agenda and promise of mass deportations of immigrants in the U.S. unlawfully.",
      "Abrego Garcia was indicted by a federal grand jury on two charges of human smuggling in late May, after which the government returned him to the U.S. to face federal prosecution. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "His return came weeks after a federal judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court. A U.S. immigration official had acknowledged Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador was an administrative error, as he had been granted a legal status in 2019 that prevented the Department of Homeland Security from removing Abrego Garcia to his home country because of likely persecution by local gangs.",
      "After Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. to face the human smuggling offenses, the Justice Department requested he remain detained while awaiting trial. But Holmes earlier this month rejected that request and said he should be granted pretrial release.",
      "The Justice Department appealed that decision, and a U.S. district judge set a hearing for July 16 on the request to revoke Holmes' release order.",
      "But during a hearing last week to review the conditions of Abrego Garcia's release, lawyers for the Salvadoran man and the Justice Department acknowledged that he would likely be detained by the Department of Homeland Security and deported swiftly after being released from Justice Department custody, which would interfere with his criminal proceeding.",
      "Holmes put off issuing her order of release, and Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked her to delay it further because of what they said are conflicting statements about whether he would be removed to a third country \u2014 one other than El Salvador \u2014 if detained by immigration authorities while awaiting trial.",
      "Federal prosecutors did not oppose the request.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed an executive order Monday afternoon terminating the United States' sanctions program on Syria, the White House announced.",
      "The executive order comes after Mr. Trump announced in May during a trip to the Middle East that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on the country. While in the Middle East, Mr. Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who announced a transitional government in March. The Assad regime\u00a0collapsed under the weight of an offensive by opposition forces. Sanctions will remain on Bashar al-Assad, Syria's former president.",
      "\"The order will remove sanctions on Syria while maintaining sanctions on the former president, Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, persons linked to chemical weapons activities, ISIS and their affiliates, and Iranian proxies,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday.",
      "Syria's transitional government has been pushing the Trump administration for sanctions relief for months, and some work has been underway to ease some sanctions since before the president's May announcement.",
      "Some sanctions would still need to be formally revoked by Congress. Syria has been under U.S. sanctions in some form since 1979, when the country was designated a state sponsor of terrorism.",
      "Last month, the Treasury Department issued formal guidance rolling back some sanctions on banks, airlines and al-Shaara. It also released guidelines for approved transactions in Syria, including infrastructure projects. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at the time that the measures were designed to encourage investment in Syria.",
      "\"As President Trump promised, the Treasury Department and the State Department are implementing authorizations to encourage new investment into Syria,\" Bessent said. \"Syria must also continue to work towards becoming a stable country that is at peace, and today's actions will hopefully put the country on a path to a bright, prosperous, and stable future.\"",
      "The new transitional government has blamed sanctions \u2014 which include penalties on third countries for doing business in Syria \u2014 for the country's inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct sizable chunks of war-ravaged cities and rebuild a health care system decimated by war.",
      "Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two U.S. allies in the region, have backed normalizing relations with Syria's new government. Both countries have provided aid to Syria, and Saudi Arabia has offered to pay off some of the country's debts, two activities that could run afoul of sanctions. The Saudis see an opportunity to win the new Syrian government over to their side, after decades of the country being allied with their top regional rival, Iran, while the Assad regime was in power.",
      "Relief was a key topic in meetings between Syrian officials, including its Central Bank Governor Abdelkadir Husrieh, and other world leaders at the IMF and World Bank spring meetings last month in Washington.",
      "Some of the most punitive measures were imposed over the last two decades on the Assad regime for human rights abuses and support for groups designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations. The Assad government collapsed in December as rebel groups, including fighters led by Sharaa, swept into Damascus, ending a 13-year-long civil war.",
      "In 2003, then-President George W. Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act into law, which centered on Syria's support for U.S.-designated terror groups like Hezbollah, Syria's military presence in Lebanon, as well as alleged development of weapons of mass destruction, oil smuggling and backing of armed groups in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.",

      "A government cybersecurity contractor is being held in jail in Washington, D.C., for driving his Jeep near crowds on the National Mall, in what prosecutors have described as an \"absolutely outrageous\" crime on June 21.",
      "At a court hearing Monday, prosecutors argued Curtis Lear of Washington, D.C., off-roaded his vehicle onto the grass of the National Mall near hundreds of people, some of whom had to \"dodge out of the way.\"",
      "A federal prosecutor said Lear drove erratically and in circles, forcing \"people to run in every direction in terror.\" Photographs submitted in court filings by the Justice Department show the black Jeep kicking up a cloud of dirt and grass as it moved on the pedestrian-only landmark on the night of June 21.",
      "The federal prosecutor said one victim and the victim's spouse had to leap away \"to avoid being struck\" by Lear's car.",
      "Lear did not speak during Monday's hearing, nor has he entered a plea in the case. He faces multiple federal charges, including destruction of government property.",
      "Other photos submitted to court Monday showed the vehicle came in close proximity to the U.S. Capitol and crowds, causing approximately $10,000 in damage to the Mall.",
      "According to court filings, when he was stopped by an officer on foot, Lear rolled down the driver's side window and stated, \"It's just a joke.\"",
      "U.S. Park Police, in a statement to CBS News, said Lear was arrested hours after the incident on the Mall. A police spokesperson said an incorrect arrest date for Lear was mentioned during Monday's hearing.",
      "Prosecutors said investigators tracked Lear to his home in Washington, in part by tracking the license plate of his Jeep.",
      "In court on Monday, Judge Michael Harvey pressed prosecutors about whether they had determined any further motive for the attack, or any associations between Lear and larger organizations. The Justice Department attorney told Harvey there were none.",
      "The June 21 scare comes amid a series of warnings from homeland security experts about the risk of vehicular attacks in public areas and gatherings. At least 14 people were killed and dozens injured when an attacker drove around barricades and hurtled down Bourbon Street in New Orleans' French Quarter on New Year's Day.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:23:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Democrats found themselves locked out of power in Washington after the 2024 presidential election. Now campaign groups are readying an effort to help the party regain power.",
    "story": [
      "An alliance of leading national Democratic groups is preparing a new effort this summer focused on driving voter engagement as the party tries to regain support following its defeats in 2024.",
      "The plans, first obtained by CBS News, fall under the label of what these groups have dubbed \"Organizing Summer.\" While this year has relatively few major statewide elections,\u00a0 such as gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, the 2026 midterms will be a crucial test for a party that is trying to respond to the lessons learned from Republicans' wins in last year's campaigns, including the presidential race. The groups behind the summer organizing effort include the Democratic National Committee, the Democrats' coalition of state parties as well as the campaign arms for House, Senate and gubernatorial contests.",
      "The DNC alone intends to initially invest a six-figure dollar amount in the wide-ranging effort, with plans to scale to seven figures as the summer goes on.",
      "\"For too long, the DNC has been a D.C. institution, and we're trying to get the DNC out of DC and into the states through this program,\" a Democratic strategist familiar with the plans said.",
      "The summer program is focused on voter engagement and registration, particularly with voters who wouldn't otherwise hear Democrats' messaging. The DNC has signed up 16,000 volunteers, twice as many as it typically has in an off-election year, according to a Democratic strategist familiar with the plans. As part of the summer effort, Democrats will urge volunteers to connect with voters in less politically dominated parts of life, with the outline of the plan pointing to community groups, book clubs and social media platforms as examples.",
      "The plans include developing a \"direct pathway to share feedback they receive from voters, and what they are seeing online, helping the party inform its messaging and strategy on an ongoing basis,\" according to upcoming details about the party's work shared by the strategist familiar with the program.",
      "\"We are deploying an army of thousands of volunteers to activate their communities, register voters, and make sure the Republicans who are putting billionaires ahead of working and middle class Americans lose their elections in 2025 and lose their seats in the midterms,\" DNC chairman Ken Martin said in a statement.",
      "National Democrats are also keen on trying to build momentum after party infighting spilled out into the open during the early months of Martin's tenure leading the DNC.",
      "An April announcement from activist David Hogg and his political organization, Leaders We Deserve,\u00a0 detailing plans to \"start primarying out-of-touch, ineffective House Democrats in solid blue seats\" caused a rift with Martin and other party leaders. This eventually led to Hogg losing his position as a DNC vice chair. Soon after that standoff ended, attention grew around\u00a0two leaders from major labor unions exiting the DNC, bringing about more questions about the direction of the party moving forward.",
      "Many Democrats have been uneasy about the infighting, wanting to focus instead on trying to win elections in the coming months and years.",
      "In an attempt to help do that, Democrats' summer initiative includes all\u00a035 of the GOP districts\u00a0the House Democrats' campaign arm is focusing on at this stage, U.S. Senate races in North Carolina and Maine and the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, according to the Democratic strategist familiar with the plans.",
      "Democrats are already attempting to use President Trump's wide-ranging \"big, beautiful bill\" making its way through Congress as a flashpoint in the midterms, and that work will also be a major point of the summer organizing program.",
      "The GOP House version of the legislation, which narrowly passed the chamber,\u00a0continues\u00a0major parts of Mr. Trump's first term Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Yet it also includes more politically volatile changes, such as enforcing Medicaid work requirements and changes to federal food assistance. Senate Republicans have been working to try and pass their own version of the bill as well. As the process plays out, national Republicans already appear to be centering a major part of the GOP's chances in the 2026 midterms on Mr. Trump's agenda legislation.",
      "\"The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes common-sense policies supported by a majority of Americans,\" House GOP campaign arm chairman Richard Hudson\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media recently. \"@HouseGOP Republicans are putting Americans first while Democrats defend the waste, fraud, abuse, and illegal aliens.\"",
      "Last year's elections sent Republicans to Washington with unified control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, giving them clear paths to act on Mr. Trump's agenda. Democrats are facing a difficult map to try and reclaim the Senate in 2026, meaning that the left's best hopes at gaining power back in Washington are likely centered on winning back the House next year. Since Mr. Trump's second inauguration, Democratic governors have proven to be a major counter to his actions, meaning that either maintaining or winning governor's offices around the country is a critical goal for the party as well. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, for instance, sued Trump and others earlier this month over the\u00a0federal deployment\u00a0of state National Guard members following immigration protests.",
      "Whether efforts like the summer organizing will be enough to help the party move forward is likely to be closely watched among politicians and operatives looking to build campaigns not just for the 2026 midterms, but the 2028 presidential election cycle as well.",
      "\"Our job this summer is to make sure working families know exactly who is responsible for taking food off their table and ripping away their health care,\" Martin said in his statement.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:08:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP Senate version of the \"big, beautiful bill\" would raise the cost of wind and solar projects by 10% to 20%, one energy group estimated.",
    "story": [
      "The latest version of the bill containing President Trump's second term agenda would hobble the renewable energy industry with a new excise tax, in addition to speeding up the sunsetting of tax credits and other benefits.",
      "The additional tax on wind and solar projects, which appeared on page 558 in the version of the bill released over the weekend, is estimated to increase consumer energy prices 8% to 10% and would tax clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an\u00a0analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax would apply to all projects that go into construction after June 16 through 2036, and it would also apply to projects that are placed into service after 2027, even if they already are under construction.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Politico Monday that she planned to introduce an amendment that would tie eligibility for the wind and solar tax credits to a project's construction start date, rather than its service date. The Senate is currently holding a marathon vote series on\u00a0proposed amendments to the bill.",
      "These wind and solar projects would have to pay the tax if a certain percentage of the value of their materials are sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. The provision is ostensibly designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components would be cost prohibitive, and some data and AI companies \u2014 which require prodigious amounts of energy \u2014 could turn to China or other countries for reliable and affordable power sources, according to clean power experts.",
      "The Senate bill also scales back or eliminates renewable energy tax breaks that have been in place since 2005 and revised and expanded a few times since then, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The most recent expansion contained tax breaks for individuals for electric vehicles, wind and solar development, and energy efficient appliances and provided tax credits for clean electricity-generating projects that went into service from 2023 through the end of 2032.",
      "Both the Senate and the House would end the renewable energy tax credits, but the Senate would accelerate the timeline in the House version, which would end the tax credits for renewable energy projects placed in service after 2028, a year later than the Senate would.",
      "Eliminating the existing tax credits would likely kill up to 72% of the new wind and solar installations that were to be completed in the U.S. over the next decade, according to analysis from Rhodium Group, a research firm.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who until Saturday was silent on the bill after his social media spat with President Trump over the House version, said of the Senate bill that it was \"Utterly insane and destructive.\"",
      "\"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,\" he said in a post on X. And he predicted it would \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\" Musk also said, \"A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.\"",
      "According to Politico, President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to further \"crack down\" on wind and solar energy by phasing out clean energy credits faster, rather than sunsetting the tax incentives more slowly, which moderate senators favored. Some asked for help easing the hit their states would take as a result of cancelled projects, job losses and higher energy prices.",
      "The renewable energy industry, manufacturing unions and even some conservatives also criticized the new tax.",
      "Conservative energy expert Alex Epstein, advocates ending the green tax credits, but he appeared to be taken by surprise by the excise tax, saying in a post on X, \"I just learned about the excise tax and it's definitely not something I would support.\"",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also quickly condemned the tax.",
      "Neil Bradly, the Chamber's executive vice president, said on social media, \"taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables.\u00a0 Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.\"",
      "The North American Building Trades Union, in a statement, called the bill potentially \"the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.\"",
      "\"Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,\" the statement continued. \"In some cases, it worsens the already harmful trajectory of the House-passed language, threatening an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs and over 3 billion work hours, which translates to $148 billion in lost annual wages and benefits.\"",

    "summary": "GOP tax and spending bill would create a tax deduction for workers in tipped occupations. But not all would lower taxes for workers in tipped jobs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's promise to eliminate taxes on worker tips could soon come to fruition as senators try to iron out the final details of a\u00a0massive budget package\u00a0he has dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "One part of the legislation, the centerpiece of the Trump administration's economic agenda, would provide workers who rely on tips for a large share of their income, such as waiters, bartenders and hairdressers, with relief from federal income tax on those tips.",
      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",
      "How would \"no tax on tips\" work?",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate versions\u00a0of the tax and spending bill vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who would benefit?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all would benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants would qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees would not despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

    "story": [
      "Detentions of immigrants without criminal histories have risen sharply since May amid a broader push to expand immigration enforcement, according to a CBS News analysis of data from the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "White House adviser Stephen Miller announced a push for a new, higher target of 3,000 arrests daily in late May. From the first week of May to the first week of June, new ICE detentions of people facing only civil immigration charges, such as entering the country without authorization, rose by over 250%.",
      "President Trump has repeatedly said his administration is focusing deportation efforts on criminals. Until recently, federal agents working to enforce his orders have detained more immigrants with criminal convictions or pending criminal charges than those without them each week, the data shows.",
      "But even among those with criminal convictions \u2014 about 40% of detainees since Jan. 20 \u2014 the majority were not for violent offenses. Overall, roughly 8% of all detainees had been convicted of violent crimes, CBS News found.",
      "\"What we're doing is we're really going after the criminal aliens, of which we have plenty to work with,\" Mr. Trump said at an event promoting his legislative package on Thursday. At a White House news conference with the president Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi was asked about enforcement and said, \"The violent criminals in our country are the priority now.\"",
      "However, top White House officials, including \"border czar\" Tom Homan, have also said anyone who entered the country illegally could face removal.",
      "Homan told CBS News in May that while ICE would prioritize public safety and national security threats, \"If you're in the country illegally, you're not off the table,\" adding, \"It's a violation of law to enter this country illegally.\"",
      "More than 97,000 people have been detained over Mr. Trump's first five months in office, CBS News' analysis found, while ICE arrests, which do not always result in detentions, topped 100,000 earlier this month.",
      "A record 59,000 people were currently being held in ICE detention as of June 23 \u2014 nearly half of them with no criminal record, CBS News reported last week.",
      "The data CBS News analyzed for this report comes from ICE and was released to the Deportation Data Project, a group of academics and lawyers who collect and publish immigration data. The group sued to obtain the data after filing a Freedom of Information Act request.",
      "ICE did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Since the first week of June, the number detained with only civil immigration charges was double that of individuals with criminal convictions. This represents an abrupt reversal from the first four months of Mr. Trump's second term, when the number of immigration detainees with a criminal record outnumbered those detained on civil immigration charges.",
      "The new target of 3,000 daily arrests announced by Miller is a sharp increase from the the 660 daily arrests made on average during Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office.",
      "Out of the more than 97,700 people ICE has detained since Mr. Trump took office, more than 39,500, or about 40%, had criminal convictions. Of those, nearly 23,000 were removed as of mid-June.",
      "Among those with criminal convictions, about 8,200 \u2014 8.4% \u2014 had convictions for violent crimes, including 478 convicted of homicide and about 6,800 convicted of assault or sexual assault. Violent offenses, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, include crimes that are \"threatening, attempting, or actually using physical force against a person.\"",
      "Additionally, about 5,000 had drug-related convictions.",
      "Traffic-related offenses made up the largest category of crimes among those with prior convictions, with driving under the influence of alcohol the single most common violation.",
      "In an interview with CBS News's Major Garrett in May, Homan blamed \"sanctuary city\" policies for leading to more arrests of those without criminal convictions.",
      "\"When sanctuary cities force us into the neighborhood to find that bad guy, many times that person is with others that are illegally in the country but may not be a criminal target,\" he said. \"Well, they're going to go too.\"",
      "Homan has called these \"collateral arrests.\"",
      "People without criminal convictions are also easier targets for removal, said Ariel Ruiz Soto, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. That's because they tend to be easier to find and more concentrated in one place, he added.",
      "\"It requires significantly more resources to go after one person who may be armed and dangerous as opposed to going outside a Home Depot and trying to gather a larger number of people,\" he told CBS News.",
      "A CBS News poll completed in early June indicates that mass deportation of non-criminals is unpopular among Americans. The poll found that Americans who believe Mr. Trump's deportation efforts are focused on dangerous criminals support those efforts. But among those who do not think criminals were the focus, support dropped dramatically.",
      "Heightened ICE activity has sparked protests across the country in recent weeks, especially in Los Angeles, where Mr. Trump called in the National Guard in response.",
      "California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom accused the administration of \"indiscriminately targeting hardworking immigrant families, regardless of their roots or risk.\"",
      "Some Republican elected officials have also expressed concern. Six GOP members of Congress wrote a letter to ICE acting director Todd Lyons requesting that ICE reveal how many convicted criminals have been deported since January.",
      "\"Every minute that we spend pursuing an individual with a clean record is a minute less that we dedicate to apprehending terrorists or cartel operatives,\" they wrote.",
      "Ruiz Soto, of the Migration Policy Institute, told CBS News that based on Homan's statements on immigration enforcement, he isn't surprised that detentions are predominantly non-criminals.",
      "\"There's been a disconnect from the beginning about the rhetoric from President Trump that seems to emphasize a focus on violent and the 'worst of the worst' criminals compared to what his cabinet and DHS has been saying from Day One,\" he said. \"When you look at the numbers it's very clear that has not been the case since the beginning.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration said a failure by the university to enact certain changes would put at risk its access to federal financial resources.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Trump administration informed Harvard University on Monday that it found the elite school violated federal civil rights law through its treatment of Jewish and Israeli students on campus and warned that a failure by the university to enact certain changes \"immediately\" would put at risk its federal financial resources.",
      "Top Trump administration officials at the Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and Education, as well as the General Services Administration, notified Harvard of the findings of an investigation into alleged antisemitism at the school and concluded that it is in \"violent violation\" of a provision of the Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs that receive federal assistance.",
      "\"Harvard's commitment to racial hierarchies \u2014 where individuals are sorted and judged according to their membership in an oppressed group identity and not individual merit \u2014 has enabled anti-Semitism to fester on Harvard's campus and has led a once great institution to humiliation, offering remedial math and forcing Jewish students to hide their identities and ancestral stories,\" the administration officials, which make up the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, wrote.",
      "They warned that a failure to \"institute adequate changes immediately\" would lead to a loss of federal financial resources to Harvard and \"continue to affect\" the university's relationship with the federal government.",
      "Harvard said in response to the investigation's conclusion that it has made \"significant strides to combat bigotry, hate and bias\" and is committed to \"ensuring members of our Jewish and Israeli community are embraced, respected, and can thrive at Harvard.\"",
      "\"Antisemitism is a serious problem and no matter the context, it is unacceptable. Harvard has taken substantive, proactive steps to address the root causes of antisemitism in its community,\" the university said in a statement. \"In responding to the government's investigation, Harvard not only shared its comprehensive and retrospective Antisemitism and Anti-Israeli Bias Report but also outlined the ways that it has strengthened policies, disciplined those who violate them, encouraged civil discourse, and promoted open, respectful dialogue. Harvard is far from indifferent on this issue and strongly disagrees with the government's findings.\"",
      "The Trump administration has been engaged in an ongoing battle with Harvard and mounted efforts to punish the school on multiple fronts. Agencies have frozen billions of dollars in grants and contracts to the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based university and revoked its ability to enroll foreign students. Harvard has sued the administration over its efforts, and a federal judge temporarily blocked the moves related to international students. President Trump has also threatened to revoke\u00a0Harvard's tax-exempt status, and the university is facing numerous investigations from across the federal government.",
      "Many of the sanctions stem from what administration officials have said is the school's failure to condemn antisemitism and protect Jewish students on campus. But the Trump administration has also taken aim at Harvard's hiring and admissions practices, and in April, it made a series of 10 demands in a letter to university leadership. Among the changes government officials said Harvard needs to undertake are a discontinuation of its diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs and policies; implementation of merit-based admissions and hiring policies; and disclosure of all foreign funding sources.",
      "Harvard bucked the administration's demands, which its president, Alan Garber, said exceed the power of the federal government.",
      "In its latest letter to Garber related to the civil rights investigation, led by the Office for Civil Rights at the United States Department of Health and Human Services, federal officials accused Harvard of \"being among the most prominent and visible breeding ground for race discrimination.\" They cited the Supreme Court's June 2023 ruling that ended affirmative action programs in higher education, which arose from a challenge to Harvard's policies.",
      "\"Any institution that refuses to meet its duties under federal law may not receive a wide range of federal privileges,\" they said.",
      "The letter is signed by Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for civil rights; Sean Keveney, acting general counsel of the Department of Health and Human Services; Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner for Federal Acquisition Service at the General Services Administration; and Thomas Wheeler, acting general counsel at the Department of Education.",
      "The officials said its investigation found that a quarter of Jewish students felt physically unsafe on the Ivy League campus, and Jewish and Israeli students were assaulted and spit on. They also cited a pro-Palestinian encampment set up on Harvard Yard last year that \"instilled fear in, and disrupted the studies of, Jewish and Israeli students.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it found that \"Harvard has been in some cases deliberately indifferent, and in others has been a willful participant in anti-Semitic harassment of Jewish students, faculty, and staff.\"",
      "Amid the ongoing fight with Harvard, Mr. Trump\u00a0hinted earlier this month that his administration had been in talks with the university, writing on social media that it was \"very possible that a Deal will be announced over the next week or so.\"",
      "\"They have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,\" the president wrote. \"If a Settlement is made on the basis that is currently being discussed, it will be 'mindbogglingly' HISTORIC, and very good for our Country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not provide any further details about the possible settlement or what it would resolve.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 09:49:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration and Republicans have argued that the limits on coordinated spending violate the First Amendment.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider whether federal limits on coordinated spending by political parties in support of their candidates violate the First Amendment.",
      "The court's review of an appeals court ruling that upheld the coordinated spending limits set up a high-stakes campaign finance dispute that will be heard in the court's next term, with a decision expected just months before the 2026 midterm elections. The Supreme Court allowed the Democratic National Committee and other party committees to intervene and participate in the case, since the Justice Department has joined the GOP in calling on the court to strike down the restrictions as unconstitutional.",
      "The case is likely to join a string of recent rulings from the Supreme Court's conservative majority that have unraveled campaign finance limits as violations of the First Amendment, allowing more money to flow into politics. In its landmark 2010 decision in the case Citizens United v. FEC, the justices struck down prohibitions on political spending by corporations. Four years later, the high court invalidated a limit on the amount of money a donor could contribute to federal candidates in a two-year election cycle.",
      "In the latest case, which involved GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the Supreme Court ruled in 2022 that a cap on the amount of post-election contributions that can be used to repay a candidate who loaned money to their own campaign was unconstitutional.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court now, brought by Republican political committees and JD Vance when he was a candidate for the Senate, involves a 50-year-old provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act that restricts the amount of money political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates during a campaign. For 2024, the limits on coordinated spending by party committees were from $123,600 to $3.7 million for Senate candidates, and between $61,800 and $123,600 for House candidates.",
      "In 2022, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee, Vance and then-Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio challenged the constitutionality of the coordinated party expenditure limits. Chabot lost his reelection bid in November 2022.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit upheld the limits under a 2001 Supreme Court decision that rejected a challenge to an earlier version of the restrictions. The composition of the high court has changed significantly in the 24 years since that decision, and it now has a 6-3 conservative majority. Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from the 2001 ruling, is the only justice who is still on the court.",
      "In its decision, the 6th Circuit's 10-judge majority acknowledged that \"the law and facts have changed\" since the 2001 ruling and said \"political campaigns and political spending have changed in the last two decades.\"",
      "The Republicans appealed to the Supreme Court and urged it to strike down the limits on coordinated spending as a violation of the First Amendment. They are represented by two lawyers with ties to President Trump: Noel Francisco, who was solicitor general during his first term, and Don McGahn, who served as White House counsel.",
      "\"Congress has built a wall of separation between party and candidate, forcing party committees to figure out how to get their candidates elected without hearing from them,\" they wrote in their appeal. \"That is the campaign 'equivalent of prohibiting communication between a coach and quarterback late in a tied game.'\"",
      "The Republicans urged the Supreme Court to either clarify its 2001 decision upholding the spending limits or overrule it outright, calling it an \"aberration\" that was \"plainly wrong the day it was decided.\"",
      "Because political parties cannot coordinate with their candidates, the GOP committees said donors are directing more of their money to outside groups like superPACs.",
      "\"The result is a more polarized process in which political parties \u2014 an institutional force almost as old as 'the formation of the Republic itself' \u2014 have been supplanted by less-restricted speakers,\" they said.",
      "Backing the Republicans in their appeal is the Trump administration, which is not defending the law before the Supreme Court. In a May filing with the justices, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the government agrees that the expenditure limits violate the First Amendment by restricting parties' right to engage in political speech in coordination with their candidates.",
      "\"The core function of a political party is to promote its candidates to the electorate. A party performs that function most effectively in cooperation with the candidates themselves,\" Sauer wrote. \"By restricting that cooperation, the party-expenditure limit severely burdens the rights of parties and candidates alike.\"",
      "The Justice Department has a longstanding policy of defending federal statutes facing constitutional challenges, but Sauer said it determined \"this is the rare case that warrants an exception to that general approach.\"",
      "Because the government sided with the Republicans in arguing that the limits should be invalidated, Democratic Party committees sought to intervene because there was no one to defend the law and the 6th Circuit's decision. The Justice Department did not oppose their intervention.",

    "story": [
      "Toronto \u2014 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said late Sunday trade talks with U.S. have resumed after Canada rescinded its plan to tax U.S. technology firms.",
      "President Trump said Friday that he was suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to continue with its tax on technology firms, which he called \"a direct and blatant attack on our country.\"",
      "The Canadian government said \"in anticipation\" of a trade deal \"Canada would rescind\" the Digital Serves Tax. The tax was set to go into effect Monday.",
      "Carney and Mr. Trump spoke on the phone Sunday, and Carney's office said they agreed to resume negotiations.",
      "\"Today's announcement will support a resumption of negotiations toward the July 21, 2025, timeline set out at this month's G7 Leaders' Summit in Kananaskis,\" Carney said in a statement.",
      "Carney visited Mr. Trump in May at the White House and was polite but firm. Mr. Trump traveled to Canada for the G7 summit in Alberta, where Carney said Canada and the U.S. had set a 30-day deadline for trade talks.",
      "Mr. Trump, in a post on his social media network last Friday, said Canada had informed the U.S. that it was sticking to its plan to impose the digital services tax, which applies to Canadian and foreign businesses that engage with online users in Canada.",
      "The digital services tax was due to hit companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It would have applied retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion U.S. bill due at the end of the month.",
      "Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, called Carney's retreat a \"clear victory\" for the president.",
      "\"At some point, this move might have become necessary in the context of Canada-US trade negotiations themselves but Prime Minister Carney acted now to appease President Trump and have him agree to simply resume these negotiations, which is a clear victory for both the White House and big tech,\" B\u00e9land said.",
      "He said it makes Carney look vulnerable to President Trump's outbursts.",
      "\"President Trump forced PM Carney to do exactly what big tech wanted. U.S. tech executives will be very happy with this outcome,\" B\u00e9land said.",
      "Canadian Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne also spoke with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday.",
      "\"Rescinding the digital services tax will allow the negotiations of a new economic and security relationship with the United States to make vital progress,\" Champagne said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement Friday was the latest swerve in the trade war he's launched since taking office for a second term in January. Progress with Canada has been a roller coaster, starting with the president poking at the nation's northern neighbor and repeatedly suggesting it would be absorbed as a U.S. state.",
      "Canada and the U.S. have been discussing easing a series of steep tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on goods from Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as 25% tariffs on autos. He is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the expiration of the 90-day negotiating period he set.",
      "Canada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Mr. Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, though some products are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Mr. Trump's first term.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 05:00:13 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration eliminated the CDC team that developed national guidelines for prescribing contraception safely for millions of women with underlying medical conditions.",
    "story": [
      "For Brianna Henderson, birth control isn't just about preventing pregnancy.",
      "The Texas mother of two was diagnosed with a rare and potentially fatal heart condition after having her second child. In addition to avoiding another pregnancy that could be life-threatening, Henderson has to make sure the contraception she uses doesn't jeopardize her health.",
      "For more than a decade, a small team of people at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention worked to do just that, issuing national guidelines for clinicians on how to prescribe contraception safely for millions of women with underlying medical conditions \u2014 including heart disease, lupus, sickle cell disease, and obesity. But the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, fired those workers as part of the Trump administration's rapid downsizing of the federal workforce.",
      "It also decimated the CDC's larger Division of Reproductive Health, where the team was housed \u2014 a move that clinicians, advocacy groups, and fired workers say will endanger the health of women and their babies.",
      "Clinicians said in interviews that counseling patients about birth control and prescribing it is relatively straightforward. But for women with conditions that put them at higher risk of serious health complications, special care is needed.",
      "\"We really were the only source of safety monitoring in this country,\" said one fired CDC staffer who worked on the guidelines, known as the U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, or MEC. \"There's no one who can actually do this work.\" KFF Health News agreed not to name this worker and others who were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation.",
      "The stakes are high for people like Henderson. About six weeks after having her second baby, she said, her heart \"was racing.\"",
      "\"I feel like I'm underwater,\" Henderson said. \"I felt like I couldn't breathe.\" She eventually went to the hospital, where she was told she was \"in full-blown heart failure,\" she said.",
      "Henderson was diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy, an uncommon type of heart failure that can happen toward the end of pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. Risk factors for the condition include being at least 30 years old, being of African descent, high blood pressure, and obesity.",
      "The CDC contraception guidelines say that combined hormonal contraception, which contains both estrogen and progestin to prevent pregnancy, can pose an \"unacceptable health risk\" for most women with peripartum cardiomyopathy, also known as PPCM. For some women with the diagnosis, a birth control injection commonly known by the brand name Depo-Provera also carries risks that outweigh its benefits, the guidelines show. Progestin-only pills or a birth control implant, inserted into a person's arm, are the safest.",
      "Henderson said her cardiologist had to greenlight which contraception she could use. She uses a progestin-only birth control implant that's more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy.",
      "\"I didn't know that certain things can cause blood clots,\" Henderson said, \"or make your heart failure worse.\" Heart failure is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in the U.S., with PPCM accounting for up to 70% of heart failure cases during pregnancy.",
      "Sweeping HHS layoffs in late March and early April gutted the CDC's reproductive health division, upending several programs designed to protect women and infants, three fired workers said.",
      "About two-thirds of the division's roughly 165 employees and contractors were cut, through firings, retirements, or reassignments to other parts of the agency, one worker said.",
      "Among those fired were CDC staffers who carried out the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, a survey established nearly 40 years ago to improve maternal and infant health outcomes by asking detailed questions of women who recently gave birth. The survey was used \"to help inform and help reduce the contributing factors that cause maternal mortality and morbidity,\" one fired worker said, by allowing government workers to examine the medical care people received before and during pregnancy, if any, and other risk factors that may lead to poor maternal and child health.",
      "The firings also removed CDC workers who collected and analyzed data on in vitro fertilization and other fertility treatments.",
      "\"They left nothing behind,\" one worker said.",
      "U.S. contraception guidelines were first published in 2010, after the CDC adapted guidance developed by the World Health Organization. The latest version was published in August 2024. It includes information about the safety of different types of contraception for more than 60 medical conditions. Clinicians said it is the premier source of evidence about the safety of birth control.",
      "\"It gave us so much information which was not available to clinicians at their fingertips,\" said Michael Policar, a physician and professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California-San Francisco School of Medicine.",
      "\"If you've got a person with, let's say, long-standing Type 2 diabetes, someone who has a connective-tissue disease like lupus, someone who's got hypertension or maybe has been treated for a precursor to breast cancer \u2014 something like that? In those circumstances,\" Policar said, \"before the MEC it was really hard to know how to manage those people.\"",
      "The CDC updates the guidelines comprehensively roughly every five years. On a weekly basis, however, government workers would monitor evidence about patients' use of contraception and the safety of various methods, something they were doing when HHS abruptly fired them this spring, two fired workers said. That work isn't happening now, one of them said.",
      "Sometimes the agency would issue interim changes outside the larger updates if new evidence warranted it. Now, if something new or urgent comes up, \"there's not going to be any way to update the guidelines,\" one fired worker said.",
      "In 2020, for example, the CDC revised its contraception recommendations for women at high risk of HIV infection, after new evidence showed that various methods were safer than previously thought.",
      "HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard declined to say why CDC personnel working on the contraception guidelines and other reproductive health issues were fired, or answer other questions raised by KFF Health News' reporting.",
      "Most women of reproductive age in the U.S. use contraception. CDC data from 2019, the most recent available, shows that more than 47 million women ages 15 to 49 relied on birth control. About 1 in 10 used long-acting methods such as intrauterine devices and implants; 1 in 7 used oral contraception.",
      "The latest guidelines included updated safety recommendations for women who have sickle cell disease, lupus, or PPCM, and those who are breastfeeding, among others. Clinicians are now being told that combined hormonal contraception poses an unacceptable health risk for women with sickle cell disease, because it might increase the risk of blood clots.",
      "\"It can really come down to life or death,\" said Teonna Woolford, CEO of the Sickle Cell Reproductive Health Education Directive, a nonprofit that advocates for improved reproductive health care for people with the disease.",
      "\"We really saw the CDC guidelines as a win, as a victory \u2014 they're actually going to pay attention,\" she said.",
      "The 2024 guidelines also for the first time included birth control recommendations for women with chronic kidney disease. Research has shown that such women are at higher risk of serious pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia and preterm delivery. Their medical condition also increases their risk of blood clots, which is why it's important for them to not use combined hormonal contraception, fired CDC workers and clinicians said.",
      "The CDC information \"is the final say in safety,\" said Patty Cason, a family nurse practitioner and president of Envision Sexual and Reproductive Health. Having only static information about the safety of various types of birth control is \"very scary,\" she said, because new evidence could come out and entirely new methods of contraception are being developed.",
      "Henderson said it took her heart two years to recover. She created the nonprofit organization Let's Talk PPCM to educate women about the type of heart failure she was diagnosed with, including what forms of birth control are safe.",
      "\"We don't want blood clots, worsening heart failures,\" Henderson said. \"They already feel like they can't trust their doctors, and we don't need extra.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced Sunday that he won't seek reelection in 2026, hours after President Trump threatened to back a primary challenge against him when he refused to support his massive spending and tax bill which he dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"It's not a hard choice, and I will not be seeking re-election,\" Tillis said in a statement Sunday. He noted that he hasn't \"been excited about running for another term,\" citing the choice between \"spending another six years navigating the political theatre and partisan gridlock in Washington\" or spending time with his family.",
      "The North Carolina Republican was first elected to the Senate in 2014, and speculation has swirled for weeks around whether he would seek another term. The announcement came hours after Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social criticizing Tillis for his opposition to some of the provisions within the massive tax legislation making its way through the Senate, while the president said he would be meeting with possible primary opponents to run against Tillis, \"looking for someone who will properly represent the Great People of North Carolina.\"",
      "Tillis had said earlier Sunday that he could not support the legislation, which is the centerpiece of the president's second-term agenda, due to Medicaid cuts \"that would be devastating to North Carolina.\"",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor Sunday night, Tillis said, \"Republicans are about to make a mistake on health care and betraying a promise. It is inescapable that this bill in its current form will betray the very promise that Donald J. Trump made in the Oval Office or in the Cabinet Room when I was there with Finance, where he said we can go after waste, fraud and abuse on any programs.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters after his comments, he also took issue with the way the bill is being moved forward, saying, \"If you've got to surprise or jam your conference to get something done, you're a pretty sh***y legislator.\"",
      "The senator also outlined his thoughts about Washington in recent years in his earlier statement Sunday: \"It's become increasingly evident that leaders who are willing to embrace bipartisanship, compromise, and demonstrate independent thinking are becoming an endangered species.\"",
      "In an apparent nod to former Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Tillis said \"Democrats recently lost two such leaders who were dedicated to making the Senate more of a functional and productive legislative body.\" He added that \"their presence in the Senate chamber has been sorely missed every day since\" they opted not to seek reelection.",
      "\"It underscores the greatest form of hypocrisy in American politics,\" Tillis continued. \"When people see independent thinking on the other side, they cheer. But when those very same people see independent thinking coming from their side, they scorn, ostracize, and even censure them.\"",
      "The announcement will open up a key seat in North Carolina, which has historically voted for Republicans in every presidential race, with the exception of Barack Obama in 2008.",
      "National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"has won North Carolina three times, and the state's been represented by two Republican Senators for over a decade.\"",
      "\"That streak will continue in 2026 when North Carolinians elect a conservative leader committed to advancing an agenda of opportunity, prosperity, and security,\" Scott said.",

The defense secretary responded that he was \"not aware of any intelligence that I've reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be \u2014 moved or otherwise.\"",
      "Grossi on Sunday said Iran did not share that they had any plans to move the enriched uranium, but at the same time \"there was no physical time\" for Iran to share that information.",
      "The IAEA director general also conceded that it's \"logical to presume that when [Iran] announce[s] that they are going to be taking protective measures\" that moving the enriched uranium \"could be part of it.\" But he also emphasized that \"this is why it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to continue their indispensable work as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brennan pushed Grossi that since it's unclear if the uranium had been moved and all the centrifuges cannot be accounted for, there's an open question that Iran could still \"sprint towards a bomb\u2026if they wanted to.\" Grossi said he didn't want to be an \"alarmist,\" but \"we need to be in a position to ascertain, to confirm what is there, and where is it and what happened.\"",
      "\"Iran had a very vast ambitious program, and part of it may still be there, and if not, there is also the self-evident truth that the knowledge is there,\" Grossi said. \"The industrial capacity is there. Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. So you cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have. It's a huge country, isn't it? So I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military operations or not, you are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily.\"",
      "Grossi confirmed that his IAEA inspectors were never able to verify Iran's claims that its nuclear program was only for peaceful ends and that it was not trying to develop a weapon.",
      "\"We didn't see a program that was aiming in that direction, but at the same time, they were not answering very, very important questions that were pending,\" Grossi said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Saturday that there were calls in Iran for the arrest and execution of Grossi.",
      "When asked about alleged threats against nuclear inspectors, Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, said in a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation\" that Iran is not threatening nuclear inspectors, including Grossi.",
      "Nuclear inspectors \"are in Iran,\" Iravani said. He said they are in a \"safe condition,\" but \"they cannot have access to our site.\"",
      "Iravani also said that since Iran is a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), nuclear \"enrichment is our right, and an inalienable right, and we want to implement this right.\"",
      "Iravani added that he did not think the enrichment will \"ever stop.\"",

      "\"Melissa Hortman will be remembered as the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history \u2013 and I'll always remember her as a close friend, a mentor, and the most talented legislator I've ever known,\" Walz said in his eulogy. \"For seven years, I've had the privilege of signing her bills into law. And I know that millions of Minnesotans will get to live better lives because she and Mark chose public service.\"",
      "Melissa Hortman was remembered for her leadership, sense of humor and strong commitment to doing good work to improve the lives of Minnesotans.",
      "\"Her mission was to get as much good done for as many people as possible,\" Walz said. \"That focus on people is what made Melissa so effective. She knew how to get her way, no doubt about it. But she never made anyone feel like they'd gotten rolled at the negotiating table.\"",
      "Mark Hortman shared his wife's passion for helping others, Walz said, the two having met at a mentorship event in Washington, D.C., more than 30 years ago.",
      "\"...There's a part of the story that belongs only to those of us fortunate enough to know the people behind that legacy,\" Walz said. \"It takes place at CR's Billiards, where Mark loved to shoot pool on Monday nights. It takes place in the garden, where Melissa fussed over her lilies like they were wayward members of the caucus. It takes place in the kitchen, where Mark fed his sourdough starter and Melissa mixed margaritas and baked cakes and Gilbert begged for scraps and the sound of laughter filled the air.\"",
      "The governor encouraged people to learn from the way the Hortmans lived to honor their legacy.",
      "\"Maybe this is a moment when each of us can examine the way we work together, the way we talk about each other, the way we fight for the things we care about. A moment when each of us can recommit to engaging in politics and life the way Mark and Melissa did \u2013 fiercely, enthusiastically, heartily, but without ever losing sight of our common humanity,\" Walz said. \"But let's not do it because of the way Mark and Melissa died. Let's do it because of the way they lived, and the way they led. With joy and passion. With respect and empathy. With purpose and humility.\"",
      "Griffith said the Hortmans would regularly open their Brooklyn Park home to guests, adding they referred to it as the \"Hortman Hotel.\"",
      "\"Everyone was welcome,\" Griffith said. \"I can't believe how Melissa and Mark lived community with that degree of intentionality. It's a beautiful thing.\"",
      "In her eulogy, Williams added that the evenings Mark and Melissa Hortman spent with their friends \"held a sacrosanct position\" on their calendars.",
      "\"We are buried in sorrow right now, but I do believe that we will experience joy again. And Mark and Melissa would not want it any other way,\" she said.",
      "Colin Hortman, the son of Mark of Melissa, gave the prayer alongside his fianc\u00e9e. He recited the Prayer of St. Francis, a copy of which he says Melissa Hortman kept in her wallet.",
      "Among attendees were former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who were invited to the funeral by Walz on behalf of the Hortmans' children.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar was unable to attend the Hortmans' funeral in person, but praised their leadership.",
      "\"They met as volunteers working to help kids, and that dedication to serving others never wavered,\" Klobuchar said in a statement.. \"Sophie and Colin said that the best way to honor their parents is 'to do something, whether big or small, to make our community just a little better for someone else.' I can think of no better way to honor Melissa and Mark.\"",
      "In the days following their deaths, the Hortman children, in a statement remembering their parents, encouraged people to honor their memory with a list of actions, including baking, petting a dog and planting a tree.",
      "John and Yvette Hoffman, who were shot about 90 minutes before the Hortmans were killed, issued a statement following Saturday's funeral service.",
      "\"We are devastated by the loss of Melissa, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert. Their tragic passing has left a profound sadness for all who knew them and whose lives they touched. We all watched the service; it was heartbreakingly beautiful. Our hearts are with the Hortman family in this time of immense grief,\" the Hoffmans said.",
      "The Hoffmans continued by saying they \"know justice will be served for both of our families\" and thanked those who attended the memorial Friday.",
      "\"We want you to know we were there with you in spirit,\" they wrote.",
      "Hortmans lie in state",
      "The funeral comes one day after the Hortmans and their dog laid in state in the Minnesota Capitol Rotunda. Melissa Hortman is the first woman to ever have the honor.",
      "Walz was among the first mourners to visit the rotunda on Friday. Later Friday afternoon, former President Joe Biden arrived at the State Capitol rotunda to pay tribute.",
      "People began arriving before 10 a.m. Friday, standing on the Capitol steps to make sure they were in place for their chance to pay tribute to the lawmaker many say perfected the art of compromise \u2014 working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do what she thought was best for all Minnesotans.",
      "\"It's an honor to be here,\" said Julie Johnson, of Rochester. \"Melissa was just such a giving, selfless servant for everybody.\"",
      "Some came with flowers. Others wore their hearts on their sleeves, devastated by the loss of the people's lawmaker who worked for decades to make the lives of all Minnesotans better.",
      "Minnesota Department of Public Safety Assistant Commissioner John Cunningham said 7,500 people paid respects at the Capitol rotunda on Friday.",
      "Melissa Hortman served in the Minnesota House for 11 terms, representing District 34B, after being elected to the legislature in 2004. She also spent several years in the role of House Speaker.",
      "Melissa Hortman and her husband leave behind two children.",
      "Since her killing, many have been praising her leadership. On Thursday, U.S. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Delano, honored her on the House floor as a bridge builder.",
      "\"As speaker of the Minnesota House, she led with integrity and fostered bipartisan collaboration, even during the most challenging times in our state,\" Emmer said.",
      "Until Melissa Hortman was killed, the Minnesota state House was evenly divided 67-67. In the state Senate, Democrats hold a one-seat majority.",
      "\"Melissa Hortman represented the best of Minnesota,\" DFL party chair Richard Carlbom said in a statement. \"She was a tireless, devoted public servant who deeply loved our state and devoted her life to making it a better place. The warmth and kindness she showed to her family and friends were matched only by her fierce commitment to improving the lives of those she had never even met.\"",
      "The Hortmans' suspected killer",
      "Vance Boelter, 57, is accused of killing the Hortmans and their dog inside their Brooklyn Park home in the early morning hours of June 14. He was arrested near his Sibley County home some 36 hours after the shootings. Officials say it was the largest manhunt in Minnesota history.",
      "About 90 minutes before the Hortmans were killed, Boelter is accused of going to the Champlin home of\u00a0Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman\u00a0and shooting him nine times.\u00a0His wife, Yvette, was shot eight times. The Hoffmans are still recovering. The former President also paid a visit to the Hoffmans on Friday.",

      "Posting on Truth Social\u00a0on Friday afternoon, the president said the U.S. will let Canada know what their tariff rate will be in the next week. The trade talks blowup comes only a week after the president met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the Group of Seven\u00a0economic summit in Alberta.",
      "\"We have just been informed that Canada, a very difficult Country to TRADE with, including the fact that they have charged our Farmers as much as 400% Tariffs, for years, on Dairy Products, has just announced that they are putting a Digital Services Tax on our American Technology Companies, which is a direct and blatant attack on our Country,\" the president wrote. \"They are obviously copying the European Union, which has done the same thing, and is currently under discussion with us, also. Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately.\"",
      "Canada's digital services tax, which was enacted last year, will hit tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet (Google's parent company), Meta and Uber with a 3% tax on revenue from users in Canada.

    "story": [
      "An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a \"matriarchal society\" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published\u00a0in Science this week.",
      "Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a \"Mother Goddess\" cult and signs of a matriarchal society.",
      "A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building.",
      "During the early years in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said.",
      "Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males.",
      "\"We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line \u2014 a matrilineal system,\" study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and\u00a0found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the\u00a0journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said upon the release of their findings, \"It is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

      "Work from two decades ago suggested the rocks could be 4.3 billion years old, placing them in the earliest period of Earth's history. But other scientists using a different dating method contested the finding, arguing that long-ago contaminants were skewing the rocks' age and that they were actually slightly younger \u2014 at 3.8 billion years old.",
      "In the new study, researchers sampled a different section of rock from the belt and estimated its age using the previous two dating techniques - measuring how one radioactive element decays into another over time. The result: The rocks were about 4.16 billion years old.",
      "The different methods \"gave exactly the same age,\" said study author Jonathan O'Neil with the University of Ottawa.",

      "Free to unstrap and float about the cabin, the passengers were able to take in the view through the largest windows in any operational spacecraft as the ship climbed to an altitude of just above 65 miles. That's about three miles higher than the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The capsule then began falling back to Earth and the passengers returned to their seats for the descent to touchdown. The reusable booster, meanwhile, made its own return to the launch site, dropping tail first to a rocket-powered touchdown.",
      "Floating under three red-and-blue parachutes, the New Shepard capsule touched down a stone's throw from the booster's concrete landing pad, closer than any previous landing. Blue Origin said that it was the result of \"low winds ... and within the safety margins of our predicted models.\"",
      "Blue Origin has now launched 13 passenger flights since the sub-orbital spacecraft carried Amazon and Blue Origin founder Bezos and three others aloft in July 2021. The company has now launched 74 passengers, including Bezos' wife Lauren S\u00e1nchez, and four who have flown twice.",
      "Blue Origin and its passengers do not reveal how much it costs to fly aboard a New Shepard, but it's thought to be more than $500,000 per seat.",
      "The company has had the sub-orbital passenger market to itself since June 2024, when competitor Virgin Galactic, founded by entrepreneur Richard Branson, retired its original rocketplane to focus on building two upgraded Delta-class spacecraft. Virgin is expected to resume flights next year.",

Grace reminds us that spaceflight  is not just a feat of engineering,  but an act of goodwill to the  benefit of every human everywhere.\"",

      "It's not known what her crew's space agencies or governments paid for their flights, but Axiom passenger seats for space station visits typically sell for around $65 million to $70 million each. That covers the cost of nearly a year of NASA-sanctioned astronaut training, launch and a two-week stay aboard the station before returning to Earth with an ocean splashdown.",
      "The crew originally hoped to begin their mission on June 10, but the flight was held up by high winds offshore and then by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It was delayed again by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module.",
      "The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port.",
      "NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it, other than saying the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the closed-off PrK compartment to about 1.9 pounds per square inch.",
      "That presumably ensures the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station creates a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the PrK, isolating it from the rest of the station. But NASA has not confirmed the reason for the pressure change.",
      "Plans for the Ax-4 mission",
      "If all goes well, Crew Dragon Grace will catch up with the space station after a  28-hour rendezvous, moving in for docking at the space-facing port or  the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday.",

      "With a doctorate in biochemistry, Whitson, 65, retired from NASA in 2018 after three flights to the space station. Going into the Ax-4 flight, she had logged 675 days in space, including one post-retirement mission for Axiom Space.",

      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",

    "story": [
      "Bumble will lay off roughly 30% of its workforce, or 240 employees, according to a regulatory filing\u00a0filed by the online dating company on Wednesday.",
      "The jobs cuts come as the company moves to reduce costs and refocus on growing its customer base. Bumble estimates the layoffs, which are slated to take place in the second half of the year, will save $40 million. The Texas-based company said it will reinvest most of that money into \"product and technology development.\"",
      "In announcing the decision to staff on Wednesday, Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd, who also co-founded Tinder, said the online dating business as is at an \"inflection point.\"",
      "\"The reality is, we need to take decisive action to restructure to build a company that's resilient, intentional and ready for the next decade,\" she wrote in an email to Bumble employees.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a Bumble spokesperson said the decision to reduce the company's workforce is in line with the company's strategic goals.",

      "Bumble said in its securities filing that it will incur $13 million to $18 million in non-recurring charges for severance and other benefits paid out to impacted employees. Shares of the online dating company were up 21% in midday trading.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whats-in-trump-big-beautiful-bill-senate-version/",
    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 20:23:32 -0400",
    "summary": "Republicans released an updated version of the legislation late Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Republicans released the latest version of President Trump's massive spending and tax bill late Friday as the GOP eyes an ambitious July 4 deadline to approve the centerpiece legislation of the president's second-term agenda.",
      "After the House narrowly approved the legislation that addresses the president's tax, defense, border and energy priorities last month, Senate Republicans have been putting their imprint on the bill. But GOP leaders are seeking a middle ground to appease the upper chamber without alienating House Republicans, who will have to approve the Senate's changes before the bill can head to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "The Senate voted Saturday to advance the measure, overcoming a key hurdle as the upper chamber works toward final passage, and will vote on amendments and then the overall bill on Monday.",
      "At the center of the bill is an extension to Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, slated to sunset at year's end, seeking to make the cuts permanent in what has been a key priority for Senate Republicans. It also includes increased spending for border security, defense and energy production, which are offset in part by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs.",
      "But along with different dynamics in the Senate, Republicans have also been contending with input from the Senate's rulekeeper, known as the parliamentarian. She has been weighing in on the bill's components to determine whether they may fly under the reconciliation process, which allows the GOP to move forward with the bill without any support from across the aisle.",
      "Here's what's in the Senate's updated version of the \"big, beautiful bill,\" some of which remains in flux:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. Like the House-passed bill, the legislation imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. But the Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, isn't in compliance with Senate rules.",
      "The parliamentarian also weighed in on the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in the Senate in recent weeks. It's a departure from the House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $25 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The Senate bill still shifts the costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "However, Alaska and Hawaii would receive temporary exemptions from the cost-sharing requirement. Both states would receive a two-year reprieve if the Department of Agriculture determines they are \"actively implementing a corrective action plan.\"",
      "The package also aligns with the House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18-64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could also receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the House-passed bill, as Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, outlining that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress are aiming to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the Senate bill, $300 less than the House-passed hike. The House version reverts the increase to $2,000 after 2028.",
      "Limits on overtime and tips deductions",
      "The bill would allow individuals to deduct up to $25,000 for tip wages and $12,500 for overtime. But the provisions would expire in 2028. The Senate bill would reduce the deductions for individuals making over $150,000, while the House bill does not include income limits.",
      "Changes to standard deduction",
      "The Senate wants to permanently expand the basic standard deduction, which was nearly doubled in 2017. The increases will expire at the end of the year. The House bill, however, would expand the deduction only through 2028.",
      "Asylum fee",
      "The legislation also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum and other fees on diversity immigrant visas.",
      "Pause on AI regulations",
      "A revised proposal on a pause on state regulations on artificial intelligence also made it into the Senate bill. The original provision called for a 10-year moratorium, but Republicans reached a compromise over the weekend that says states can only access $500 million in federal funds for AI infrastructure if they don't regulate the technology for five years. The compromise also includes exemptions to protect the safety of children online.",

    "summary": "Authorities in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, shared updates on their investigation after a suspect ambushed firefighters on the job.",
    "story": [
      "The suspect who allegedly\u00a0ambushed firefighters on the job\u00a0in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, had contact and discussion with first responders before shooting at them with a shotgun, killing two of them and critically injuring a third, Kootenai County Sheriff Robert Norris said.",
      "Fire officials on Monday identified the deceased firefighters as Battalion Chief Frank Harwood, 42, and Battalion Chief John Morrison, 52. The third firefighter who was critically injured, engineer Dave Tysdal, underwent two successful surgeries on Monday, fire officials said during a news conference.",
      "During a separate news conference on Monday, Norris identified the suspect as 20-year-old Wess Roley. His body was found at the scene of the fire late Sunday night along with a firearm, the sheriff said. Norris said Monday that it appeared the suspect shot himself.",
      "As the Nettleton Gulch Fire continued to burn on Monday, the sheriff said it will take days to fully process the area, but investigators have located Roley's vehicle in an embankment near the scene. He said investigators have not yet been able to inventory the vehicle, which has \"a lot of debris in there.\" People who have seen the vehicle say it appears Roley was living in the vehicle, Norris said.",
      "Norris said authorities have not found any writings that would indicate the suspect's motive.",
      "The suspect previously had five \"very minor\" encounters with law enforcement but had no criminal history, according to the sheriff. The interactions with officers \"had to do more with trespassing, he was asked to leave and [was] cooperative,\" Norris said. Other interactions included welfare checks reported by property owners about Roley's vehicle, the sheriff said.",
      "Authorities are also looking through Roley's social media presence for any clues to a possible motive. Norris said investigators have not found any connection to \"Islamic jihad,\" disputing rumors spreading on social media.",
      "\"We have information that he, at one time, he wanted to be a firefighter,\" Norris said, but added that investigators don't know if that has any connection to what happened.",
      "Victims identified as Frank Harwood and John Morrison",
      "Kootenai County Fire & Rescue Chief Christopher Way said at a news conference Monday that the families of Harwood and Morrison and the firefighting community as a whole are dealing with \"unimaginable loss.\"",
      "Battalion chief Harwood had been a member of the department for 17 years, Way said. Harwood was also a well-respected former Army National Guard member, Way said. He is survived by his wife and two children.",
      "\"This loss is felt by so many, including all of the members of his shift that worked and saw the incident yesterday,\" Way said.",
      "Morrison had been a firefighter since 1996, Way said, adding that he had served the city of Coeur d'Alene for over 28 and a half years. Way said he had the opportunity to work with Morrison two weeks before he was killed, and they had a \"rare moment\" to talk.",
      "\"We talked about being better fathers. We talked about being better leaders. We talked about being better firefighters,\" he said.",
      "After the ambush shooting, Way said local law enforcement agencies are now going on every call with the fire department.",
      "\"I don't know that we're ever going to be able to guarantee people's peace of mind, at least for a while after an incident like this,\" he said. \"But we are taking every measure we can to ensure safety.\"",
      "Suspect lured firefighters by sparking fire, sheriff says",
      "The firefighters were responding to a wildfire Sunday afternoon in a popular recreation area at Canfield Mountain when Roley began firing at them, Norris said. The sheriff said investigators believe the suspect used a flint starter to start the fire to lure the firefighters there.",
      "\"And we do believe that it was an ambush and it was intentional. These firefighters did not have a chance,\" Norris said Sunday.",
      "Investigators initially believed there might have been more than one sniper, due to early reports from first responders, but now say the evidence indicates it was Roley armed with a shotgun.",
      "\"We know that there was a shotgun used, absolutely, 100%, we know that for sure,\" Norris said Monday, noting that rifled slugs were recovered from the scene. He said smaller fragments were also found in the area, and the scene is still being processed.",
      "Suspect's grandfather describes him as \"pretty much a normal kid\"",
      "According to a Facebook post by his mother, Roley moved from Arizona to Idaho when he turned 18 in 2023 to work for his father's tree-cutting company. In an update shared in October 2024, his mother wrote he was \"doing great living in Idaho.\"",
      "In a phone interview with CBS News, his paternal grandfather, Dale Roley, described Wess as \"pretty much a normal kid.\" He said his grandson had recently lost his cellphone and did not have a \"high-powered rifle.\"",
      "\"He had a .22 long rifle and a shotgun,\" he said. \"That's not a high-powered rifle by any stretch. We're just hoping there's some weird circumstances and Wess wasn't actually involved.\"",
      "Dale Roley confirmed that Wess had worked for his father's tree company, but more recently was working at a different tree company in Coeur d'Alene. He said his grandson \"wanted to be a fireman\" and applied for a job with the forestry service four or five months ago.",
      "In a statement provided by their attorney, Wess Roley's family offered its condolences to the families of the firefighters who were killed and to the Coeur d'Alene community.",
      "\"There are no words that can suffice for this tragedy and the infinite losses suffered by those affected by this shooting,\" the family said in the statement. \"We do not understand why this happened or how this came about. Our hearts and spirits are broken for the lost and hurting, and for our own loss as well. We intend to fully cooperate with authorities in seeking answers. As we also deal with the grief of this heinous tragedy in our own family, we will not be answering any questions outside of law enforcement.\"",

    "summary": "After debate on President Trump's massive tax bill stretched into early Monday, the Senate began a \"vote-a-rama\" on the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0A marathon vote series is underway in the Senate after the chamber debated President Trump's massive tax bill into the wee hours of the morning as Republicans work to pass the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda.",
      "The House narrowly passed the bill last month, and Senate Republicans have been working to put their mark on the legislation, treading carefully so as not to throw off the delicate balance in the lower chamber. The House will need to approve the Senate's changes to the bill before it can head to the president's desk for his signature. And lawmakers are trying to move quickly, with a self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the measure signed.",
      "The Senate worked through the weekend as the GOP nears a final sprint on the legislation ahead of the deadline. Titled \"One Big, Beautiful Bill,\" the legislation includes increased spending for border security, defense and energy production, which is offset in part by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Sunday that the legislation would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.",
      "Senate Republicans advanced the legislation\u00a0late Saturday, with all but two voting in favor following hours of delay as the GOP worked to iron out last-minute details and dispel concern among holdouts. The vote on the motion to proceed stayed open for more than three hours as holdouts sought assurances from GOP leaders. Some tweaks were made to the bill before Republicans ultimately received enough votes to move forward.",
      "Senate Democrats further delayed the legislation's path forward by forcing the bill to be read in its entirety, starting late Saturday. After nearly 16 hours, the Senate clerks concluded their reading of the bill on the floor, starting the clock on debate. Each side then had up to 10 hours for debate.",
      "The \"vote-a-rama\"",
      "Following debate, and a break until the morning, the Senate began what's known as a \"vote-a-rama\" Monday in which senators may offer an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to cast vote after vote. Democrats have been using the opportunity to put their GOP colleagues on the record on a number of controversial issues ahead of the midterm elections.",
      "But before the chamber could get to the amendment votes, senators had to address an outstanding disagreement over the current policy baseline, an accounting approach that would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing. Senate Majority Leader John Thune maneuvered Sunday to allow the use of the current policy baseline, before Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer quickly appealed the move, requesting a vote as Democrats railed against it as the \"nuclear option.\" The chamber voted 53-47, along party lines, to affirm the use of the current policy baseline on Monday.",
      "Schumer said that Democrats would bring \"one amendment after the other\" Monday, and began the process by offering an amendment to send the bill back to the Finance Committee to revisit some of its health care provisions. The chamber voted down the amendment in a party-line vote.",
      "Democrats proposed a number of amendments to attempt to roll back some of the bill's more controversial provisions. Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, proposed an amendment to remove the bill's provisions that he said would force rural hospitals to limit their services or close their doors. And Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, proposed an amendment to eliminate what he called \"red tape\" around Medicaid eligibility. Other amendments proposed by Democrats concerned cuts to food assistance and state provider taxes, among a number of related issues. The amendments fell short.",
      "GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas offered the first Republican-led amendment, which would have reduced federal Medicaid expansion payments to states that provide coverage to undocumented immigrants charged with specific crimes. The Senate's rulemaker, known as the parliamentarian, determined that the provision would require a 60-vote threshold. The amendment fell short, though it picked up support from a handful of Democrats.",
      "Amid the slew of votes, anticipation swirled around a consequential amendment expected to be put forward by GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida later Monday. The amendment would significantly reduce the federal Medicaid expansion match made under the Affordable Care Act, barring new enrollees after 2030, in a move that would make the bill more palatable to some fiscal hawks.",
      "Thune has backed the amendment, calling it \"great policy,\" and forecasted that it will get significant support among the Senate GOP. But whether it has enough support to be added to the bill remains to be seen.",
      "The chamber's pace began to slow Monday evening. As the amendment votes dragged on, Democrats accused Republicans of stalling.",
      "\"They're delaying, they're stalling, they're cutting a lot of back-room deals,\" Schumer told reporters. \"But we're just pushing forward, amendment after amendment \u2014 they don't like these amendments.\"",
      "The path to passage",
      "Senate Republicans have been pursuing the legislation through the budget reconciliation process, which enables the party in the majority to move ahead without support from across the aisle. With only a simple majority required to advance the measure, rather than the 60-votes needed to move forward with most legislation, Senate Democrats have few mechanisms to combat the bill's progress.",
      "With a 53-seat majority, Senate GOP leaders can only afford to lose support from three Republicans \u2014 and would then still require a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance. And although a number of senators who had expressed opposition to the measure ultimately decided to advance it Saturday, how they will vote on the measure in a final form remains unclear.",
      "Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina were the two Republicans to oppose the bill's advancement Saturday, and are expected to oppose the legislation on final passage. Tillis, who announced Sunday that he is not seeking reelection, took to the Senate floor that night to outline his opposition to some of the bill's cuts to Medicaid, claiming \"Republicans are about to make a mistake on health care\" and arguing that the GOP is \"betraying our promise.\"",
      "\"It is inescapable that this bill in its current form will betray the very promise that Donald J. Trump made\" to target only waste, fraud and abuse in the entitlement program, Tillis said, claiming that the president has been \"misinformed\"",
      "The North Carolina Republican argued that the July 4 deadline is an \"artificial\" one, saying Senate Republicans are rushing, while encouraging the chamber to \"take the time to get this right\" and align more closely with the House's Medicaid provisions.",
      "But Senate GOP leaders are still moving ahead. Thune, a South Dakota Republican, delivered a defense of the bill on the Senate floor ahead of the vote-a-rama Monday, pushing back on criticism over Medicaid cuts, the impact on the deficit and the use of the current policy baseline.",
      "\"Let's vote,\" Thune said. \"This is good for America.\"",
      "When asked whether he's confident Senate Republicans have the votes to pass the legislation, the majority leader told reporters, \"Never, until we vote.\"",
      "Vance was on hand to break a possible tie vote Saturday, though his vote ultimately wasn't needed. Still, the vice president met with GOP holdouts in the majority leader's office Saturday as the White House put pressure on lawmakers to get the bill across the finish line.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that the president has \"been in touch with lawmakers all weekend long to get this bill passed.\"",
      "\"The White House and the president are adamant that this bill is passed and that this bill makes its way to his desk,\" Leavitt said. \"Republicans need to stay tough and unified during the home stretch, and we are counting on them to get the job done.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, warned Sunday that the legislation would be a \"political albatross\" for Republicans, while suggesting that the bill could even lose support among the GOP, saying \"it's not over until it's over.\"",
      "\"I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this, and we'll see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their conviction,\" Warner said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

    "summary": "GE Applicances joins the list of companies investing in U.S. manufacturing in new tariff environment under President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "GE Appliances executive Lee Lagomarcino said U.S. trade policy was the driving factor in the company's recent decision to accelerate a plan to move overseas jobs back to the U.S.",
      "\"Any time we decide to move a factory or redesign a platform, it's an expensive endeavor, so we have to think through the strategy and trajectory of market,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in discussing GE Appliances' move to expedite a shift in production of its washers and dryers from China to the U.S. in order to avoid having to pay\u00a0stiffer tariffs.",
      "\"This was the right time to strike on the business opportunity given the environment with tariffs,\" added Lagomarcino, vice president, clothes care, at GE Appliances.",
      "GE Appliances on June 26\u00a0announced it would invest $490 million in a laundry care manufacturing plant in Kentucky that would create 800 new American jobs. In a statement last week, GE Appliances CEO Kevin Nolan said the reshoring effort \"aligns with the current economic and policy environment.\"",
      "The company, which has long planned to reshore manufacturing to the U.S., said that high levies on\u00a0imports from China\u00a0under Mr. Trump have impelled the household appliance maker to \"accelerate the decision-making,\" Lagomarcino, GE Appliances' vice president of clothes care, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Once the plant is fully up and running, the company, a Haier subsidiary, will cease manufacturing in China. \"That factory will turn off when the factory in Louisville, Kentucky turns on,\" said Lagomarcino, adding that he expects the Kentucky plant to be operational by early 2027.",
      "What jobs is GE creating in the U.S.?",
      "The company is looking to fill research and development, engineering and supply chain positions at the Kentucky plant, openings for which it's already started posting on its careers site.",
      "\"We anticipate a lot of hiring for some skilled trades, and technically advanced manufacturing roles,\" Lagomarcino said. \"Our research and development team leader will need to hire more engineers, and our supply chain leader will have to hire to fill jobs.\"",
      "Why now?",
      "The investment in domestic manufacturing comes as a host of U.S. companies\u00a0announce plans\u00a0to reshore operations as they face added costs from Mr. Trump's tariff agenda.",
      "But the main force behind the production move to Louisville is GE's \"zero distance\" philosophy of building appliances where they are sold, the company said in the announcement.",
      "\"U.S. manufacturing allows us to be closer to the consumer and the team that designs and markets the products and is involved in the whole product development lifecycle,\" said Lagormarcino. \"Philosophically, and from a manufacturing and design standpoint, it makes sense.\"",
      "That said, the move makes even more sense with tariff increases in place, according to Lagormarcino.",
      "\"With tariffs or without tariffs, we think it's a good long-term strategy. But when you add tariffs, they introduce costs to the situation, and it does accelerate those actions,\" he said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-trump-tariffs/",
    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 17:59:31 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists warned that a barrage of new U.S. tariffs could trigger a renewed bout of inflation. So why aren't prices surging?",
    "story": [
      "Despite concerns earlier this year that President Trump's tariffs would cause a renewed bout of inflation, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have remained relatively stable.",
      "The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.3% in May, modestly above the central bank's 2% annual target. The May Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.4%, cooler than economists expected.",
      "The muted inflation data reflects short-term steps taken by some companies to offset the tariff impact, such as pre-ordering inventory, absorbing the cost of some tariffs to cushion consumers from price hikes, and leveraging loopholes to delay or lower duty payments, economists say.",
      "\"Many businesses have been creative and savvy in using different means to buffer the initial shock,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That doesn't mean consumers and businesses, who were battered by the highest inflation in decades during the pandemic, are out of the woods. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, thinks prices are likely to rise as tariffs gradually push up import costs in the second half of the year.",
      "\"We still think in next few months we'll continue to see the impact of the new trade policies on price levels, and they should translate into higher inflation,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Here are three reasons why tariffs haven't driven up inflation as much as many economists expected, at least for now.",
      "Aggressive \"front-loading\"",
      "After the Trump administration announced a range of tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico and dozens of other countries earlier this year, many companies scrambled to stock up, or front-load, on products, parts and other imports to\u00a0avoid incurring added tariff costs.",
      "\"They tried to front-run the imposition of the duties by importing rapidly,\" Daco said. \"They bought goods they needed and stocked them, so that was the first line of defense against the tariffs.\"",
      "Much of that extra inventory remains in warehouses or on store shelves, allowing importers to delay price hikes.",
      "\"Lots of retailers pre-ordered inventory before the tariffs went into effect, so the inventory they're selling has not been marked up yet,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waiting for clarity",
      "Some businesses facing higher tariffs are choosing to hold off on passing any cost increases through to consumers\u00a0as they wait for the fog around U.S. trade policy to lift.",
      "The Trump administration in April froze most of its tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, with that pause due to expire on July 9. And after announcing tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports earlier this year, Mr. Trump and Chinese officials on Thursday said the two countries have agreed on the framework for a trade deal.",
      "\"We have had literally dozens of changes in tariff policy in the last five months. In that highly uncertain environment, companies that sell items that are subject to tariff may be cautious about raising prices immediately,\" Charley Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Companies often refrain from raising prices to avoid scaring away consumers and losing market share to competitors.",
      "Added Daco: \"Essentially, some business decided to not immediately pass on the cost. They said, 'Let's see if we can hold out for a month, delay some imports, use the inventory on hand and be creative in terms of our broader pricing strategy'.\"",
      "Although tariffs are paid by importers, which typically pass those costs on to consumers, some foreign exporters have also been willing to take a hit.",
      "Lower tariff costs",
      "Although Mr. Trump has announced sky-high tariff rates, the actual duties collected at the U.S. border so far are lower than the official rates. That's because some importers have been able to skirt the levies by storing goods in so-called bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones.",
      "Businesses can use bonded warehouses, which are usually located near major commercial ports, to temporarily store goods, components and other inputs without immediately having to pay tariffs or taxes.",
      "\"If you make use of a warehouse or so-called foreign trade zone, you are able to delay the payment of tariffs until these goods are put into commerce,\" Daco said. \"So it's a free-trade zone, or imaginary area that is not subject to tariffs.\"",
      "Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a number of tariff exemptions and exclusions. In practice, that has resulted in the actual levies on imports often being lower than the nominal rate initially announced by the White House.",
      "As of June, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports was around 10%, compared with an official average tariff rate of 15%.",
      "Still, business can't hold the line on price hikes indefinitely if tariffs remain elevated, experts say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0told lawmakers this week\u00a0that tariffs could yet spark higher inflation, likely starting this summer,",
      "\"Part of that is due to the start-stop nature of the tariffs that have been introduced,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For us it's a question of patience more than a mystery as to where it is,\" he added. \"The typical pass-through takes some time. We expect July to be when you start to see it more.\"",

    "summary": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' fate is in a jury's hands after listening to weeks of sometimes graphic and emotional testimony.",
    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking case in New York shared concerns about an individual juror with the judge not long after they started deliberating Monday. The first day of deliberations ultimately ended without a verdict.",
      "After more than two hours of legal instructions from federal Judge Arun Subramanian, the jury of eight men and four women headed behind closed doors to deliberate at around 11:30 a.m. Subramanian told the five alternate jurors to remain on standby in case they're needed to fill in on the main jury who are weighing charges that could put the hip-hop mogul in prison for life.",
      "About 10 minutes into deliberations, the jury sent a note indicating they'd completed their first order of business: electing a foreperson.",
      "Less than two hours later, at about 1:25 p.m., a note from the jury was read in court  to inform the judge of concerns regarding one juror's ability to follow the instructions. The jury asked the judge to question this juror. The judge discussed the response with the prosecution and defense and decided to remind the jury of their obligation to follow the law and resume their deliberations.",
      "After the judge originally proposed asking the jury foreperson the nature of concerns about the fellow juror, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo suggested caution and that less be said rather than more.",
      "\"We can always ratchet it up. We can't ratchet it down,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the late afternoon, the jury sent the judge a new note with a question about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 stemming from the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The judge told the court he'd answer them on Tuesday and dismissed the jury for the day.",
      "Jurors are being provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",
      "Subramanian had stressed to the jury the importance of delivering a unanimous verdict, but also said no juror should surrender their beliefs in order to reach unanimity.",
      "Ahead of the deliberations, CBS News legal contributor Caroline Polisi, a criminal defense attorney, discussed on \"CBS Mornings\" what judges typically tell juries.",
      "\"The judge will instruct the jurors, 'maintain your own integrity with respect to what you believe, but keep an open mind, engage in discussions with other jurors, look at the evidence, see other people's point of view, and if you can with integrity really come over to, you know, the other side, then you can get to unanimity,'\" Polisi said.",
      "As the deliberations got underway, Combs faced his family and supporters in the courtroom gallery. They bowed their heads in prayer \u2014 his family members holding hands with each other. When they finished, they all applauded.",
      "The judge granted Combs' request to have some books with him during the deliberations. On his way out of the courtroom on Monday, Combs showed two books to reporters: \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" and \"The Happiness Advantage.\"",
      "The jury will sift through seven weeks of sometimes graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking \u2014 relating to two of his ex-girlfriends \u2014 and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "Polisi said the prosecution's best chance at getting a conviction could be with the sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"The prosecution made clear there only has to be one instance, out of these hundreds of 'freak-offs,' one instance where it was coerced by force, fraud or coercion, and that can include threats of harm that doesn't even include physical harm,\" Polisi said. \"So that can include fear of financial harm, fear of reputational harm. Remember, he videotaped all of these encounters, and the government laid out specific instances where he threatened to release those tapes.\"",
      "In closing arguments last week, federal prosecutors and Combs' defense team took their last shots at convincing jurors to convict or acquit the Grammy Award-winning founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law.\"",
      "She said that he used his \"close inner circle and a small army of personal staff, who made it their mission to meet the defendant's every desire, promote his power and protect his reputation at all costs.\"",
      "Agnifilo countered, \"This isn't about crime. It's about money.\" He noted that one of Combs' accusers in the criminal case also sued him in civil court.",
      "\"He is not a racketeer. He is not a conspirator to commit racketeering. He is none of these things. He is innocent. He sits there innocent. Return him to his family, who have been waiting for him,\" the lawyer told jurors.",
      "In all, 34 witnesses testified, headlined by Combs' former girlfriends Cassie \u2014 the R&B singer born Casandra Ventura \u2014 and \"Jane,\" who testified under a pseudonym. Both women said he often was violent toward them. Cassie said he forced her into hundreds of sexual encounters with paid male sex workers while Jane recounted numerous \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Jurors also saw now-infamous security camera video of Combs beating, kicking and dragging Cassie at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 and clips from videos of sexual encounters.",
      "Combs chose not to testify, and his lawyers didn't call any witnesses in their defense case. His attorneys elected instead to challenge the accusers' credibility during lengthy cross-examination questioning.",
      "The defense has acknowledged that Combs veered into violence, but his lawyers maintain that the sex acts were consensual. They contend that prosecutors are intruding in Combs' personal life and that he's done nothing to warrant the charges against him.",

    "summary": "GOP Sen. Mike Lee's plan to allow the sale of public lands ran into bipartisan opposition in the Senate and the House.",
    "story": [
      "Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah announced over the weekend he was removing a provision from the Senate's \"big, beautiful bill\" that would allow the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands for affordable housing and infrastructure.",
      "\"Because of the strict constraints of the budget reconciliation process, I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families\u2014not to China, not to BlackRock, and not to any foreign interests,\" Lee said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0announcing the withdrawal of the provision.",
      "After the Senate parliamentarian ruled that Lee's original proposal, which encompassed millions of acres, would violate budget reconciliation rules, he had reduced the acreage. The bill, which contains President Trump's tax cuts, border and defense initiatives, is being considered under the special rules because it requires only a simple majority to pass, rather than the 60-vote super majority that is required for consideration of most legislation in the Senate.",
      "Under Lee's plan, land in 11 Western states from Alaska to New Mexico would have been eligible for sale. Montana was carved out of the proposal after its lawmakers objected. In states like Utah and Nevada, the government controls the vast majority of lands, protecting them from potential exploitation but hindering growth.",
      "Lee's revised plan would have excluded all U.S. Forest Service land from possible sale. Sales of sites controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management were to be significantly reduced, Lee said, so that only land within 5 miles of population centers could be sold.",
      "But in addition to opposition from Democrats, Republican senators in Idaho and Montana objected to the plan, too. Several House Republicans also said that if the provision were included in the Senate bill, they would vote against it when the bill received a vote in the lower chamber, threatening its passage.",
      "Lee said in his statement that he still believes the federal government \"owns far too much land\u2014land it is mismanaging and in many cases ruining for the next generation\" and he complained that under Democratic presidents, \"massive swaths of the West are being locked away from the people who live there, with no meaningful recourse.\"",
      "The House originally had a public land sales provision, too, one which would have allowed sales of acreage in Utah and Nevada. But GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana, who served as interior secretary during President Trump's first administration, opposed the idea immediately.",
      "\"I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands,\" Zinke said in a statement in May. \"Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn't creating more land.\"",
      "Several other Western state Republican House members also rejected the idea, so the provision was stripped out of the budget bill before the House voted on it.",
      "Housing advocates have cautioned that federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing. Some of the parcels up for sale in Utah and Nevada under the House proposal were many miles from developed areas.",
      "New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee, said before Lee withdrew his plan that it would exclude Americans from places where they fish, hunt and camp.",
      "\"I don't think it's clear that we would even get substantial housing as a result of this,\" Heinrich said earlier this month. \"What I know would happen is people would lose access to places they know and care about and that drive our Western economies.\"",

      "The controversial\u00a0detention facility is at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in the Florida Everglades, and has its own runway. DeSantis said the site has been modified \"within a matter of days\" to also function as a detention center, and he expects the site to be operational Tuesday.",
      "\"When the president comes tomorrow, he's going to be able to see,\" DeSantis told reporters in a press conference in Florida on Monday. The Florida governor said he spoke with the president over the weekend, and Mr. Trump is \"very excited\" to visit.",
      "DeSantis called the center an \"effective way\" to increase the numbers of removals and deportations of unauthorized immigrants as the state seeks to help the federal government's deportation efforts. The facility will have up to 5,000 beds to house, process and deport individuals in the country illegally, the Trump administration said.",
      "\"There is only one road leading in and the only way out is a one-way flight,\" Leavitt said. \"It is isolated, and surrounded by dangerous wildlife in unforgiving terrain.\"",

    "story": [
      "Last week's record-breaking heat wave\u00a0is highlighting concerns about the potential health risks facing workers.",
      "At Northside Hospital Forsyth in Cumming, Georgia, Dr. Douglas Olson, the medical director for the emergency department, said he's seen a roughly 20% increase in heat-related visits since last year across the hospital's five systems. \"Most of the time it's related to occupational heat exposure,\" he said. \"So those people that are working outside for prolonged periods \u2014 it's been pretty rough.\"",
      "The brutal temperatures in Atlanta led the death of one outdoor worker, Olson confirmed.",
      "In Dallas, a mail carrier died after collapsing on his route earlier this month as local temperatures hovered in the 90s, according to CBS News Texas. His death came roughly two years after another Dallas postal worker collapsed and died after the heat index reached 117 degrees.",
      "Federal\u00a0data\u00a0shows that 479 workers in the U.S. died from heat exposure between 2011 to 2022, an average of 40 deaths a year.",
      "People who work outside, such as construction workers, landscapers and utility workers, are more likely to get dehydrated and suffer from heat-related illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What makes such symptoms so dangerous is how quickly they can escalate.",
      "\"People have a sense of what heat-related illness looks like, but a lot of times the symptoms aren't straightforward,\" said Dr. John Purakal, assistant professor in the Duke Department of Emergency Medicine.",
      "It's not only outdoor workers who sometimes must deal with stifling heat. At a June 25 hearing hosted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, representatives for United for Respect raised concerns about the safety of Amazon workers.",
      "In one instance earlier this month, the labor advocacy group said a worker at an Amazon fulfillment center in Florida had to lift heavy freight items inside a trailer for several hours where the temperatures reached 112 degrees and where the water stations were not working properly.",
      "Sam Stephenson, an Amazon spokesperson, pushed back on those claims, saying the company's water fountains are functional and that Amazon has a rotation policy for employees tasked with with unloading heavy items that ensures they have time to rest.",
      "He added that Amazon keeps employees safe through climate control systems in buildings, air conditioning in delivery vans, and access to protective clothing and hydration. Last year, Amazon also\u00a0said it invested $59 million to cool its vans.",
      "UPS, which delivered an average of 22 million packages a day last year, also has previously drawn scrutiny over the temperature of delivery workers' trucks. In a major win for workers, the company in 2023 announced they were adding both air conditioning and fans to their trucks.",
      "A spokesperson for UPS said all newly purchased vehicles have AC and that they are adding them to their fleet as quickly as possible.",
      "\"While we don't publicly share the number of vehicles we purchase, we are prioritizing deployment in the hottest regions,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our existing delivery vehicles have been upgraded with enhanced ventilation, fans, and heat shields to improve comfort and reduce cabin temperatures.\"",
      "Pushing for a federal heat standard",
      "The U.S. has no federal heat safety standards for workers, meaning protections can vary significantly depending on the employer. In the absence of a national set of rules, a handful of\u00a0states\u00a0have introduced their own regulations to protect workers from the heat.",
      "To address the gaps, OSHA in 2024 proposed a\u00a0rule\u00a0that would require employers to create plans to safeguard employees from extreme heat. Among other provisions, it would require employers to make drinking water readily available when the heat index reaches 80 degrees and provide mandatory 15-minute rest breaks when it reaches 90 degrees.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal magistrate judge said Monday that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and then was returned to the United States to face criminal charges of human smuggling, will remain in federal custody until at least mid-July.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers had asked the judge Friday to delay his release, warning that the Trump administration had made conflicting statements about whether he will be deported after he is released ahead of a trial.",
      "The brief order from U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes is the latest development in the case involving Abrego Garcia, whose removal to El Salvador in March emerged as a flashpoint in President Trump's immigration agenda and promise of mass deportations of immigrants in the U.S. unlawfully.",
      "Abrego Garcia was indicted by a federal grand jury on two charges of human smuggling in late May, after which the government returned him to the U.S. to face federal prosecution. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "His return came weeks after a federal judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court. A U.S. immigration official had acknowledged Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador was an administrative error, as he had been granted a legal status in 2019 that prevented the Department of Homeland Security from removing Abrego Garcia to his home country because of likely persecution by local gangs.",
      "After Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. to face the human smuggling offenses, the Justice Department requested he remain detained while awaiting trial. But Holmes earlier this month rejected that request and said he should be granted pretrial release.",
      "The Justice Department appealed that decision, and a U.S. district judge set a hearing for July 16 on the request to revoke Holmes' release order.",
      "But during a hearing last week to review the conditions of Abrego Garcia's release, lawyers for the Salvadoran man and the Justice Department acknowledged that he would likely be detained by the Department of Homeland Security and deported swiftly after being released from Justice Department custody, which would interfere with his criminal proceeding.",
      "Holmes put off issuing her order of release, and Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked her to delay it further because of what they said are conflicting statements about whether he would be removed to a third country \u2014 one other than El Salvador \u2014 if detained by immigration authorities while awaiting trial.",
      "Federal prosecutors did not oppose the request.",
      "\"A short delay will prevent the government from removing Mr. Abrego and allow time for the government to provide reliable information concerning its intentions,\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers wrote in a filing to Holmes.",
      "The magistrate judge agreed to the request and said Abrego Garcia will remain in the custody of U.S. Marshals to allow for the July 16 hearing and a decision on the government's bid to revoke his release order.",
      "Holmes said Abrego Garcia should be held separately from others waiting or serving sentences and given a \"reasonable opportunity\" to privately meet with his lawyers.",

It also tests whether a person's face matches their Tinder photos and examines other accounts to make sure no one else is using their likeness. Once verified, users get a blue checkmark on their profile.",
      "According to Tinder, verification data obtained during the face scans is stored for the lifetime of the person's account but gets deleted within 30 days after someone closes their account.",

      "The federal agency, which includes the National Weather Service, initially said last week that it was going to lose access to the satellite data by June 30. But in an update\u00a0posted online on Monday, NOAA said the deadline to decommission the satellite system was pushed to July 31, at the request of a top official at NASA.",
      "Operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program has since the 1960s collected environmental information each day from satellites orbiting Earth, in order to provide real-time details about conditions in the atmosphere and oceans to the military. The data was made available to weather scientists for traditional forecasting purposes, after being processed by a branch of the Navy that focuses on meteorology and oceanography.",
      "Starting Aug. 1, that naval branch will no longer process or upload satellite data to the computing interface where meteorologists previously accessed it, according to NOAA.",
      "In an email that the agency reposted online, the deputy director of its Office of Satellite and Product Operations said the Navy decided to implement that change in efforts \"to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" but would continue to distribute the data through the end of next month. A Navy spokesperson told CBS News in an email that it is \"discontinuing contributions\" to the satellite program \"given the program no longer meets our information technology modernization requirements.\"",
      "NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster called it a \"routine process of data rotation and replacement\" in a statement to CBS News on Monday, adding that remaining data sources remaining \"are fully capable of providing a complete suite of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\"",

      "An alliance of leading national Democratic groups is preparing a new effort this summer focused on driving voter engagement as the party tries to regain support following its defeats in 2024.",
      "The plans, first obtained by CBS News, fall under the label of what these groups have dubbed \"Organizing Summer.\" While this year has relatively few major statewide elections,\u00a0 such as gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, the 2026 midterms will be a crucial test for a party that is trying to respond to the lessons learned from Republicans' wins in last year's campaigns, including the presidential race. The groups behind the summer organizing effort include the Democratic National Committee, the Democrats' coalition of state parties as well as the campaign arms for House, Senate and gubernatorial contests.",
      "The DNC alone intends to initially invest a six-figure dollar amount in the wide-ranging effort, with plans to scale to seven figures as the summer goes on.",

      "The summer program is focused on voter engagement and registration, particularly with voters who wouldn't otherwise hear Democrats' messaging. The DNC has signed up 16,000 volunteers, twice as many as it typically has in an off-election year, according to a Democratic strategist familiar with the plans. As part of the summer effort, Democrats will urge volunteers to connect with voters in less politically dominated parts of life, with the outline of the plan pointing to community groups, book clubs and social media platforms as examples.",

This eventually led to Hogg losing his position as a DNC vice chair. Soon after that standoff ended, attention grew around\u00a0two leaders from major labor unions exiting the DNC, bringing about more questions about the direction of the party moving forward.",

      "In an attempt to help do that, Democrats' summer initiative includes all\u00a035 of the GOP districts\u00a0the House Democrats' campaign arm is focusing on at this stage, U.S. Senate races in North Carolina and Maine and the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, according to the Democratic strategist familiar with the plans.",
      "Democrats are already attempting to use President Trump's wide-ranging \"big, beautiful bill\" making its way through Congress as a flashpoint in the midterms, and that work will also be a major point of the summer organizing program.",
      "The GOP House version of the legislation, which narrowly passed the chamber,\u00a0continues\u00a0major parts of Mr. Trump's first term Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Yet it also includes more politically volatile changes, such as enforcing Medicaid work requirements and changes to federal food assistance. Senate Republicans have been working to try and pass their own version of the bill as well. As the process plays out, national Republicans already appear to be centering a major part of the GOP's chances in the 2026 midterms on Mr. Trump's agenda legislation.",
      "\"The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes common-sense policies supported by a majority of Americans,\" House GOP campaign arm chairman Richard Hudson\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media recently. \"@HouseGOP Republicans are putting Americans first while Democrats defend the waste, fraud, abuse, and illegal aliens.\"",
      "Last year's elections sent Republicans to Washington with unified control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, giving them clear paths to act on Mr. Trump's agenda. Democrats are facing a difficult map to try and reclaim the Senate in 2026, meaning that the left's best hopes at gaining power back in Washington are likely centered on winning back the House next year. Since Mr. Trump's second inauguration, Democratic governors have proven to be a major counter to his actions, meaning that either maintaining or winning governor's offices around the country is a critical goal for the party as well. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, for instance, sued Trump and others earlier this month over the\u00a0federal deployment\u00a0of state National Guard members following immigration protests.",
      "Whether efforts like the summer organizing will be enough to help the party move forward is likely to be closely watched among politicians and operatives looking to build campaigns not just for the 2026 midterms, but the 2028 presidential election cycle as well.",
      "\"Our job this summer is to make sure working families know exactly who is responsible for taking food off their table and ripping away their health care,\" Martin said in his statement.",

      "The WNBA is expanding to 18 teams over the next five years, with Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia all set to join the league by 2030.",
      "Cleveland will begin play in 2028, Detroit in 2029 and Philadelphia the season after, assuming they get approval from the NBA and WNBA Board of Governors. Toronto and Portland will enter the league next year.",
      "\"The demand for women's basketball has never been higher, and we are thrilled to welcome Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia to the WNBA family,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said. \"This historic expansion is a powerful reflection of our league's extraordinary momentum, the depth of talent across the game, and the surging demand for investment in women's professional basketball.\"",
      "All three new teams announced Monday have NBA ownership groups. Each paid a $250 million expansion fee, which is about five times as much as Golden State dished out for a team a few years ago. All three teams will also be investing more money through building practice facilities and other such amenities.",
      "\"It's such a natural fit that when you already have this basketball-related infrastructure, these strategies, cultures that you find to be successful, combinations of personnel that you find to be successful,\" said Nic Barlage, CEO of Rock Entertainment Group and the Cavaliers. \"Extending that into the WNBA, is just a natural next progression, especially if you have a desire to grow like we do.\"",
      "Both Cleveland and Detroit had WNBA teams in the past and Philadelphia was the home for an ABL team.",
      "\"This is a huge win for Detroit and the WNBA,\" Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores said. \"Today marks the long-hoped-for return of the WNBA to a city with deep basketball roots and a championship tradition. Detroit played a key role in the league's early growth, and we're proud to reignite that legacy as the WNBA ascends to new heights. Our plans will bring new energy, investment and infrastructure to our city and the WNBA, and additional resources to our community.\"",
      "Detroit sports stars Grant Hill, Chris Webber and Jared Goff will have minority ownership stakes in the team.",
      "The Cleveland and Detroit ownership groups said the Rockers and Shock - the names of the previous teams - would be considered but they'd do their due diligence before deciding on what the franchises will be called.",
      "\"Rockers will be a part of the mix for sure, but we are at this point, we're not going to commit to a brand identity because we want to really get into it with our fans, do some research, be very thorough and thoughtful in that process,\" Barlage said.",
      "The Detroit and Cleveland teams will play at the NBA arenas that currently exist, while Philadelphia is planning on a new building that will be completed hopefully by 2030.",
      "\"We tell the city it's going to open in 2031. We're hoping for 2030,\" said Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment Managing Partner and co-founder Josh Harris, who owns the 76ers. \"So we're trying to underpromise and overdeliver. But, right now it's 2031, so that we have a year gap, you know. We've got the Xfinity center, the Wells Fargo, they'll play there.\"",
      "Adding these three teams will give the league more natural rivalries with another team on the East Coast and Detroit and Cleveland near each other.",
      "\"I think there's some great historical rivalries in the NBA among these cities and, I think that will carry over to the WNBA,\" Detroit Pistons vice president Arn Tellem said. \"I would love nothing more to have a rivalry like we do in the NBA with Cleveland and Indiana, Philadelphia and New York and all these great cities and, and I think we will.\"",
      "Other cities that bid on teams that didn't get them include St. Louis; Kansas City, Mo.; Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tenn.; Houston; Miami; Denver; and Charlotte, N.C.",
      "\"We didn't know the demand would be where the demand ended up when we ran the process last fall into the winter,\" Engelbert said. \"Given the very high demand and supply, we wanted to evaluate, too, because we're very careful about, you know, making sure we're balancing the number of roster spots, the number of teams.",
      "\"But one thing I'm very struck by as we get into a new media deal, as the media market evolves, you know, being in these three big basketball cities is going to help from a media perspective, a corporate partners perspective.\"",
      "All the metrics, such as attendance, television ratings and sponsorships, have been on the rise the last few seasons.",
      "\"You're seeing the key performance indicators around the business, but then also just the communal impact of having a women's professional sports team,\" Barlage said. \"The largest growing segment of our Cavs youth academy, which serves 60,000 kids across the state of Ohio and upstate New York, the fastest growing segment is girls. You know, it's growing at a 30% clip year over year in participation rates. And so for us to be able to create role models, to be able to create symbols of progress, to create having ambassadors within the community representing all of these things.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:08:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP Senate version of the \"big, beautiful bill\" would raise the cost of wind and solar projects by 10% to 20%, one energy group estimated.",
    "story": [
      "The latest version of the bill containing President Trump's second term agenda would hobble the renewable energy industry with a new excise tax, in addition to speeding up the sunsetting of tax credits and other benefits.",
      "The additional tax on wind and solar projects, which appeared on page 558 in the version of the bill released over the weekend, is estimated to increase consumer energy prices 8% to 10% and would tax clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an\u00a0analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax would apply to all projects that go into construction after June 16 through 2036, and it would also apply to projects that are placed into service after 2027, even if they already are under construction.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Politico Monday that she planned to introduce an amendment that would tie eligibility for the wind and solar tax credits to a project's construction start date, rather than its service date. The Senate is currently holding a marathon vote series on\u00a0proposed amendments to the bill.",
      "These wind and solar projects would have to pay the tax if a certain percentage of the value of their materials are sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. The provision is ostensibly designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components would be cost prohibitive, and some data and AI companies \u2014 which require prodigious amounts of energy \u2014 could turn to China or other countries for reliable and affordable power sources, according to clean power experts.",
      "The Senate bill also scales back or eliminates renewable energy tax breaks that have been in place since 2005 and revised and expanded a few times since then, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The most recent expansion contained tax breaks for individuals for electric vehicles, wind and solar development, and energy efficient appliances and provided tax credits for clean electricity-generating projects that went into service from 2023 through the end of 2032.",
      "Both the Senate and the House would end the renewable energy tax credits, but the Senate would accelerate the timeline in the House version, which would end the tax credits for renewable energy projects placed in service after 2028, a year later than the Senate would.",
      "Eliminating the existing tax credits would likely kill up to 72% of the new wind and solar installations that were to be completed in the U.S. over the next decade, according to analysis from Rhodium Group, a research firm.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who until Saturday was silent on the bill after his social media spat with President Trump over the House version, said of the Senate bill that it was \"Utterly insane and destructive.\"",
      "\"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,\" he said in a post on X. And he predicted it would \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\" Musk also said, \"A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.\"",
      "According to Politico, President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to further \"crack down\" on wind and solar energy by phasing out clean energy credits faster, rather than sunsetting the tax incentives more slowly, which moderate senators favored. Some asked for help easing the hit their states would take as a result of cancelled projects, job losses and higher energy prices.",
      "The renewable energy industry, manufacturing unions and even some conservatives also criticized the new tax.",
      "Conservative energy expert Alex Epstein, advocates ending the green tax credits, but he appeared to be taken by surprise by the excise tax, saying in a post on X, \"I just learned about the excise tax and it's definitely not something I would support.\"",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also quickly condemned the tax.",
      "Neil Bradly, the Chamber's executive vice president, said on social media, \"taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables.\u00a0 Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.\"",
      "The North American Building Trades Union, in a statement, called the bill potentially \"the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.\"",
      "\"Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,\" the statement continued. \"In some cases, it worsens the already harmful trajectory of the House-passed language, threatening an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs and over 3 billion work hours, which translates to $148 billion in lost annual wages and benefits.\"",

    "summary": "GOP tax and spending bill would create a tax deduction for workers in tipped occupations. But not all would lower taxes for workers in tipped jobs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's promise to eliminate taxes on worker tips could soon come to fruition as senators try to iron out the final details of a\u00a0massive budget package\u00a0he has dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "One part of the legislation, the centerpiece of the Trump administration's economic agenda, would provide workers who rely on tips for a large share of their income, such as waiters, bartenders and hairdressers, with relief from federal income tax on those tips.",
      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",
      "How would \"no tax on tips\" work?",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate versions\u00a0of the tax and spending bill vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who would benefit?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all would benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants would qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees would not despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

    "story": [
      "Detentions of immigrants without criminal histories have risen sharply since May amid a broader push to expand immigration enforcement, according to a CBS News analysis of data from the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "White House adviser Stephen Miller announced a push for a new, higher target of 3,000 arrests daily in late May. From the first week of May to the first week of June, new ICE detentions of people facing only civil immigration charges, such as entering the country without authorization, rose by over 250%.",
      "President Trump has repeatedly said his administration is focusing deportation efforts on criminals. Until recently, federal agents working to enforce his orders have detained more immigrants with criminal convictions or pending criminal charges than those without them each week, the data shows.",
      "But even among those with criminal convictions \u2014 about 40% of detainees since Jan. 20 \u2014 the majority were not for violent offenses. Overall, roughly 8% of all detainees had been convicted of violent crimes, CBS News found.",
      "\"What we're doing is we're really going after the criminal aliens, of which we have plenty to work with,\" Mr. Trump said at an event promoting his legislative package on Thursday. At a White House news conference with the president Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi was asked about enforcement and said, \"The violent criminals in our country are the priority now.\"",
      "However, top White House officials, including \"border czar\" Tom Homan, have also said anyone who entered the country illegally could face removal.",
      "Homan told CBS News in May that while ICE would prioritize public safety and national security threats, \"If you're in the country illegally, you're not off the table,\" adding, \"It's a violation of law to enter this country illegally.\"",
      "More than 97,000 people have been detained over Mr. Trump's first five months in office, CBS News' analysis found, while ICE arrests, which do not always result in detentions, topped 100,000 earlier this month.",
      "A record 59,000 people were currently being held in ICE detention as of June 23 \u2014 nearly half of them with no criminal record, CBS News reported last week.",
      "The data CBS News analyzed for this report comes from ICE and was released to the Deportation Data Project, a group of academics and lawyers who collect and publish immigration data. The group sued to obtain the data after filing a Freedom of Information Act request.",
      "ICE did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Since the first week of June, the number detained with only civil immigration charges was double that of individuals with criminal convictions. This represents an abrupt reversal from the first four months of Mr. Trump's second term, when the number of immigration detainees with a criminal record outnumbered those detained on civil immigration charges.",
      "The new target of 3,000 daily arrests announced by Miller is a sharp increase from the the 660 daily arrests made on average during Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office.",
      "Out of the more than 97,700 people ICE has detained since Mr. Trump took office, more than 39,500, or about 40%, had criminal convictions. Of those, nearly 23,000 were removed as of mid-June.",
      "Among those with criminal convictions, about 8,200 \u2014 8.4% \u2014 had convictions for violent crimes, including 478 convicted of homicide and about 6,800 convicted of assault or sexual assault. Violent offenses, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, include crimes that are \"threatening, attempting, or actually using physical force against a person.\"",
      "Additionally, about 5,000 had drug-related convictions.",
      "Traffic-related offenses made up the largest category of crimes among those with prior convictions, with driving under the influence of alcohol the single most common violation.",
      "In an interview with CBS News's Major Garrett in May, Homan blamed \"sanctuary city\" policies for leading to more arrests of those without criminal convictions.",
      "\"When sanctuary cities force us into the neighborhood to find that bad guy, many times that person is with others that are illegally in the country but may not be a criminal target,\" he said. \"Well, they're going to go too.\"",
      "Homan has called these \"collateral arrests.\"",
      "People without criminal convictions are also easier targets for removal, said Ariel Ruiz Soto, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. That's because they tend to be easier to find and more concentrated in one place, he added.",
      "\"It requires significantly more resources to go after one person who may be armed and dangerous as opposed to going outside a Home Depot and trying to gather a larger number of people,\" he told CBS News.",
      "A CBS News poll completed in early June indicates that mass deportation of non-criminals is unpopular among Americans. The poll found that Americans who believe Mr. Trump's deportation efforts are focused on dangerous criminals support those efforts. But among those who do not think criminals were the focus, support dropped dramatically.",
      "Heightened ICE activity has sparked protests across the country in recent weeks, especially in Los Angeles, where Mr. Trump called in the National Guard in response.",
      "California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom accused the administration of \"indiscriminately targeting hardworking immigrant families, regardless of their roots or risk.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration said a failure by the university to enact certain changes would put at risk its access to federal financial resources.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Trump administration informed Harvard University on Monday that it found the elite school violated federal civil rights law through its treatment of Jewish and Israeli students on campus and warned that a failure by the university to enact certain changes \"immediately\" would put at risk its federal financial resources.",
      "Top Trump administration officials at the Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and Education, as well as the General Services Administration, notified Harvard of the findings of an investigation into alleged antisemitism at the school and concluded that it is in \"violent violation\" of a provision of the Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs that receive federal assistance.",
      "\"Harvard's commitment to racial hierarchies \u2014 where individuals are sorted and judged according to their membership in an oppressed group identity and not individual merit \u2014 has enabled anti-Semitism to fester on Harvard's campus and has led a once great institution to humiliation, offering remedial math and forcing Jewish students to hide their identities and ancestral stories,\" the administration officials, which make up the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, wrote.",
      "They warned that a failure to \"institute adequate changes immediately\" would lead to a loss of federal financial resources to Harvard and \"continue to affect\" the university's relationship with the federal government.",
      "Harvard said in response to the investigation's conclusion that it has made \"significant strides to combat bigotry, hate and bias\" and is committed to \"ensuring members of our Jewish and Israeli community are embraced, respected, and can thrive at Harvard.\"",
      "\"Antisemitism is a serious problem and no matter the context, it is unacceptable. Harvard has taken substantive, proactive steps to address the root causes of antisemitism in its community,\" the university said in a statement. \"In responding to the government's investigation, Harvard not only shared its comprehensive and retrospective Antisemitism and Anti-Israeli Bias Report but also outlined the ways that it has strengthened policies, disciplined those who violate them, encouraged civil discourse, and promoted open, respectful dialogue. Harvard is far from indifferent on this issue and strongly disagrees with the government's findings.\"",
      "The Trump administration has been engaged in an ongoing battle with Harvard and mounted efforts to punish the school on multiple fronts. Agencies have frozen billions of dollars in grants and contracts to the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based university and revoked its ability to enroll foreign students. Harvard has sued the administration over its efforts, and a federal judge temporarily blocked the moves related to international students. President Trump has also threatened to revoke\u00a0Harvard's tax-exempt status, and the university is facing numerous investigations from across the federal government.",
      "Many of the sanctions stem from what administration officials have said is the school's failure to condemn antisemitism and protect Jewish students on campus. But the Trump administration has also taken aim at Harvard's hiring and admissions practices, and in April, it made a series of 10 demands in a letter to university leadership. Among the changes government officials said Harvard needs to undertake are a discontinuation of its diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs and policies; implementation of merit-based admissions and hiring policies; and disclosure of all foreign funding sources.",
      "Harvard bucked the administration's demands, which its president, Alan Garber, said exceed the power of the federal government.",
      "In its latest letter to Garber related to the civil rights investigation, led by the Office for Civil Rights at the United States Department of Health and Human Services, federal officials accused Harvard of \"being among the most prominent and visible breeding ground for race discrimination.\" They cited the Supreme Court's June 2023 ruling that ended affirmative action programs in higher education, which arose from a challenge to Harvard's policies.",
      "\"Any institution that refuses to meet its duties under federal law may not receive a wide range of federal privileges,\" they said.",

    "summary": "President Trump previously said diplomatic talks could resume as early as this week, but Iran's foreign minister said he didn't think they would \"restart as quickly as that.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump recently indicated diplomatic talks with Iran could restart as soon as this week, although the White House noted no talks were officially scheduled. After U.S. airstrikes on some of Iran's nuclear facilities, followed days later by a\u00a0ceasefire to end what Mr. Trump called the\u00a012-day war between Iran and Israel, Iran's foreign minister seemed less certain about a speedy return to diplomacy.",
      "\"I don't think negotiations will restart as quickly as that,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CBS News through a translator.",
      "\"In order for us to decide to reengage, we will have to first ensure that America will not revert back to targeting us in a military attack during the negotiations,\" Araghchi said in his first interview with an American media outlet inside Iran since the bombings. \"And I think with all these considerations, we still need more time.\"",
      "However, Araghchi also insisted, \"The doors of diplomacy will never slam shut.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said during a televised address following the American strikes on June 21 that Iran's Fordo nuclear enrichment site and the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear facilities had been \"completely and totally obliterated.\" Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a news conference, \"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction.\"",
      "Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency\u00a0told CBS News the U.S. strikes caused \"severe damage, but it's not total damage.\" Grossi said Iran could likely start enriching uranium again within a few months.",
      "\"One cannot obliterate the technology and science for enrichment through bombings,\" Araghchi said. \"If there is this will on our part, and the will exists in order to once again make progress in this industry, we will be able to expeditiously repair the damages and make up for the lost time.\"",
      "When asked if Iran intends to continue enriching uranium, Araghchi said the country's \"peaceful nuclear program has turned into a matter of national pride and glory. We have also gone through 12 days of imposed war, therefore, people will not easily back down from enrichment.\"",
      "After 12 days of missile exchanges between Iran and Israel, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared victory, writing on social media, \"I offer my congratulations on the victory over the fallacious Zionist regime,\" and claiming Israel's government was \"practically knocked out and crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded on social media, calling Khamenei's declaration a lie, saying Iran had been \"decimated\" and claiming he prevented both the U.S. and Israeli militaries from assassinating the supreme leader.",
      "Mr. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet at the White House next Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump has also indicated he could order strikes on Iran again should it resume enriching uranium beyond a certain level. Araghchi questioned the legality of such action and said Iran was prepared for more attacks.",
      "\"We showed and proved during this 12-day imposed war that we have the ability to defend ourselves, and we will continue to do so should any aggression be launched against us,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed an executive order Monday afternoon terminating the United States' sanctions program on Syria, the White House announced.",
      "The executive order comes after Mr. Trump announced in May during a trip to the Middle East that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on the country. While in the Middle East, Mr. Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who announced a transitional government in March. The Assad regime\u00a0collapsed under the weight of an offensive by opposition forces. Sanctions will remain on Bashar al-Assad, Syria's former president.",
      "\"The order will remove sanctions on Syria while maintaining sanctions on the former president, Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, persons linked to chemical weapons activities, ISIS and their affiliates, and Iranian proxies,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday.",
      "Syria's transitional government has been pushing the Trump administration for sanctions relief for months, and some work has been underway to ease some sanctions since before the president's May announcement.",
      "Some sanctions would still need to be formally revoked by Congress. Syria has been under U.S. sanctions in some form since 1979, when the country was designated a state sponsor of terrorism.",
      "Last month, the Treasury Department issued formal guidance rolling back some sanctions on banks, airlines and al-Shaara. It also released guidelines for approved transactions in Syria, including infrastructure projects. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at the time that the measures were designed to encourage investment in Syria.",
      "\"As President Trump promised, the Treasury Department and the State Department are implementing authorizations to encourage new investment into Syria,\" Bessent said. \"Syria must also continue to work towards becoming a stable country that is at peace, and today's actions will hopefully put the country on a path to a bright, prosperous, and stable future.\"",
      "The new transitional government has blamed sanctions \u2014 which include penalties on third countries for doing business in Syria \u2014 for the country's inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct sizable chunks of war-ravaged cities and rebuild a health care system decimated by war.",
      "Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two U.S. allies in the region, have backed normalizing relations with Syria's new government. Both countries have provided aid to Syria, and Saudi Arabia has offered to pay off some of the country's debts, two activities that could run afoul of sanctions. The Saudis see an opportunity to win the new Syrian government over to their side, after decades of the country being allied with their top regional rival, Iran, while the Assad regime was in power.",

      "Some of the most punitive measures were imposed over the last two decades on the Assad regime for human rights abuses and support for groups designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations. The Assad government collapsed in December as rebel groups, including fighters led by Sharaa, swept into Damascus, ending a 13-year-long civil war.",
      "In 2003, then-President George W. Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act into law, which centered on Syria's support for U.S.-designated terror groups like Hezbollah, Syria's military presence in Lebanon, as well as alleged development of weapons of mass destruction, oil smuggling and backing of armed groups in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.",

      "A 92-year-old man on Monday was convicted of the rape and murder of a woman in southwestern England in what is thought to be the U.K.'s longest-running cold case ever to be solved.",
      "A jury at Bristol crown court found Ryland Headley, then aged 34, guilty of attacking 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in June 1967.",
      "\"Louisa Dunne died in a horrifying attack carried out in the place where she should have felt safest \u2014 her own home,\" prosecutor Charlotte Ream said. \"For 58 years, this appalling crime went unsolved and Ryland Headley, the man we now know is responsible, avoided justice.\"",
      "Dunne was found dead in her home by a neighbor on June 28, 1967. The night of her death, neighbors reported hearing a woman's \"frightening scream,\" the BBC reported.",
      "The cause of her death was found to be strangulation and asphyxiation. She had also been raped.",
      "It is \"one of the oldest cold cases to ever be solved in the U.K.,\"\u00a0said the Crown Prosecution Service\u00a0(CPS), which brings criminal prosecutions.",
      "Investigators retained Dunne's clothing, including a blue skirt, and other samples from her body for further examination. They also recovered a palm print from a window which Headley is believed to have used to gain entry to her home.",
      "Despite the efforts of police investigating Dunne's death 58 years ago, no key suspect was identified, the BBC reported. Police collected about 19,000 prints from men and boys at the time with no success.",
      "In 2023, the case was reexamined and the skirt was sent away for forensic testing in May last year. DNA recovered from the item of clothing linked Headley to the murder scene after his DNA was added to the national database in 2012 for an unrelated incident.",
      "Forensic scientists concluded that DNA from the skirt matched Headley's and the palm print was also his. Headley was arrested at his home in Suffolk in November.",
      "Headley was convicted of two counts of rape in the late 1970s, after he attacked women, aged 79 and 84, in Ipswich. He pleaded guilty to the charges in 1978 and was jailed for seven years.",
      "All but one of the trial witnesses in the case died, according to the CPS, so the prosecution had to rely on written accounts taken from witnesses at the time of the murder.",
      "Testimonies of the two women were read during Headley's 2025 trial.",
      "\"Hearing the voices of the victims of his 1977 offences, is just incredibly powerful and harrowing,\" said Detective Inspector Dave Marchant, senior investigating officer for the case. \"I think it gives us an insight into probably what happened within 58 Britannia Road (Dunne's home) to some degree.\"",
      "Because witnesses were not available to give evidence in court, and therefore could not be challenged on that evidence, their statements had to be treated as hearsay evidence instead, the CPS noted.",
      "Dunne's granddaughter Mary Dainton said she was stunned when she heard that Headley had been arrested. \"I accepted that some murders just never get solved and some people have to live with that emptiness and sadness,\" she said.",
      "Marchant said he is working with the National Crime Agency to determine whether Headley may be responsible for any other unsolved offenses over the years. \"Crimes of this magnitude should never go unpunished and we will remain relentless in ensuring we do everything we can to advance other unsolved murder cases in the Avon and Somerset area,\" he said.",
      "Headley will be sentenced on Tuesday.",

      "The taxpayer-funded BBC said in a statement Monday that it regrets not cutting short its live streaming signal after punk-rap duo Bob Vylan started leading a chant of \"Death, death to the IDF,\" during their Saturday performance, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "\"The BBC respects freedom of expression but stands firmly against incitement to violence,\" the statement\u00a0from the broadcaster said. \"The antisemitic sentiments expressed by Bob Vylan were utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves... The [BBC broadcasting] team were dealing with a live situation but with hindsight we should have pulled the stream during the performance. We regret this did not happen.\"",
      "The BBC, which is CBS News' partner network in the U.K., quickly acknowledged that the language used on Saturday was \"deeply offensive,\" but the network was criticized \u2014 including by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and members of his cabinet \u2014\u2014 for not reacting more quickly after the chant started.",
      "Glastonbury festival's organizers also condemned the chant in a statement, saying: \"Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\"",
      "The reaction from the Trump administration appeared to be significantly harsher, with Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau saying in a social media post on Monday that U.S. entry visas already issued to Bob Vylan's members had been revoked \"in light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants.\"",
      "The band's website shows more than a dozen scheduled tour dates in the U.S., from coast to coast, starting in late October.",
      "\"Foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,\" Landau said in the post.",
      "On Sunday, Bob Vylan posted a lengthy statement on their Instagram\u00a0page, with the caption: \"I said what I said.\"",
      "The duo, who use stage names and keep their identities anonymous, said their message was aimed at younger generations, whom they said should be shown how to fight for their own futures.",
      "\"Let us display to them loudly and visibly the right thing to do when we want and need change,\" the band said. \"Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organizing online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered.\"",
      "Local police have launched an investigation into the chants to determine whether any criminal offenses may have been committed.",
      "Glastonbury is a five-day music festival that takes place on a farm in the southwest of England. It is one of the largest music festivals anywhere in the world, drawing more than 200,000 ticketholders, and it generally takes place every other year as the organizers give the farm fields time to recover from the impact of so many revelers. The event is hosted and organized by the Eavis family, who still own the farm, and has been running for about 55 years.",
      "Bob Vylan's performance preceded that of Northern Irish rappers Kneecap, whose set the BBC did not air live due to previous instances at the group's concerts involving alleged comments supporting Hamas and Hezbollah and calling for the death of Conservative party lawmakers.",

    "story": [
      "Tehran \u2014 Seyed Rahim Bathaei has long been CBS News' eyes and ears in Iran. For 16 years, he's helped us introduce our audience to regular Iranians who've shared their hopes and fears.",
      "For all of those years, Iranian society has been divided between those who ardently support the Islamic Republic's theocratic rulers, and those who do not. Yet after 12 days of devastating war with Israel, CBS News has seen a level of national unity that wasn't there before.",
      "\"Iran is an ancient country with an ancient civilization, more than 5,000 years of history. They want to preserve it,\" Bathaei explains of his fellow Iranians. \"They say: 'We are the nation. We have a national identity. Don't smash \u2014 don't try even to smash \u2014 or don't insult our pride and this deep civilization.'\"",
      "For Bathaei, the military clash between the Middle East's archrivals had felt inevitable for some time.",
      "\"I was expecting this,\" he says. \"Iran has had this strong belief to support Palestinians and the Palestinian cause, and has not been shy to project it quite openly. So, it was obvious at some point \u2014   no one knew when \u2014 but this would come, that Iran and Israel would go on a direct war, direct confrontation instead of proxy wars. On Israel's side, doing assassination, covert operations, and on the Iranian side, fighting against Israel through what is called nowadays Iran's proxy groups. So, at some point, it was quite inevitable that both countries would have come to this boiling point.\"",
      "Israel, backed by its close ally the U.S., may well have the military capacity to bring down the government led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But Bathaei says such a move \u2014   which President Trump claims to have personally prevented during the 12 days of fighting \u2014   would have serious consequences beyond Iran's borders.",
      "\"That would be a disaster. We have already seen what happened in Libya, what happened to Syria. Iraq, actually, is a big example for us. That's a disaster for the region,\" he says. \"There will be a failed state that there might be terrorism coming out of.\"",
      "That threat may no longer feel imminent, and the ceasefire President Trump brokered between Iran and Israel has held for nearly a week, but Bathaei \u2014 relying entirely on gut feelings that come from more than 35 years as a journalist in Iran \u2014 still struggles to find optimism.",
      "\"I think we are going toward darker things,\" he says. \"I'm not a fortune teller, but my instinct tells me, yes, we are going toward darker things. But I strongly I hope I'm wrong.\"",
      "One thing did surprise Bathaei during the war with Israel: President Trump ordering U.S. warplanes to join in the bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "\"President Trump was full of surprises,\" he says. \"I was not thinking that he might have gone that far.\"",
      "\"I don't think the Iranian leadership were ready, or believed that the U.S. might attack Iran on that level,\" adds Bathaei.",
      "Now, he's worried that the U.S. could attack Iran again.",
      "The solution, Bathaei believes, is for both sides to sit down and talk it out.",
      "\"They're not talking to each other. If they sit down and start a conversation or even visit each other \u2014 I mean, Iranian politicians go and visit the U.S., U.S. politicians coming here and visit Iran \u2014 I believe a big portion of this misunderstanding can be eliminated. I'm not saying Iran and the U.S. will go be a friend, be allies, in the near, foreseeable future, but I think it's not something impossible.\"",

      "A notorious drug cartel enlisted a hacker who was able to infiltrate phone data and Mexico City's surveillance cameras to help track and kill FBI informants, the U.S. Justice Department has revealed.",
      "The 2018 operation was disclosed Thursday in a 47-page audit by the Justice Department Inspector General, outlining the FBI's \"efforts to mitigate the effects of ubiquitous technical surveillance.\"",
      "The partially redacted report cites a case involving Juaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman \u2014 the founder of the infamous Sinaloa cartel. \"El Chapo\" is now serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison in the U.S on multiple conspiracy counts for smuggling vast quantities of cocaine and other drugs into the U.S. for more than a quarter of a century.",
      "According to the newly released audit, an unnamed hacker was recruited by the cartel in 2018. The hacker \"observed people going in and out of the United States Embassy in Mexico City and identified 'people of interest' for the cartel, including an FBI assistant legal attach\u00e9,\" the report said.",

    "story": [
      "Iran's nuclear capabilities suffered \"severe damage\" in last week's U.S. airstrikes but not \"total damage,\" said the man in charge of the world's global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. \"One cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there.\"",
      "\"It is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage, first of all,\" IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And secondly, Iran has the capacities there; industrial and technological capacities. So if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again.\"",
      "The U.S. launched three strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities on June 21, following more than a week of Israeli attacks, which President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said had \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "But Grossi's comments appeared to support an early assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which suggested the strikes had only set back Iran's nuclear program by months. The Trump administration has slammed the DIA's assessment as \"low confidence,\" and Hegseth and other officials on Thursday went after the media for reporting on a \"leaked\" report.",
      "At a briefing Thursday, reporters questioned Hegseth repeatedly on whether Iran had moved its stocks of enriched uranium before the Israeli and U.S. strikes began. The defense secretary responded that he was \"not aware of any intelligence that I've reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be \u2014 moved or otherwise.\"",
      "Grossi on Sunday said Iran did not share that they had any plans to move the enriched uranium, but at the same time \"there was no physical time\" for Iran to share that information.",
      "The IAEA director general also conceded that it's \"logical to presume that when [Iran] announce[s] that they are going to be taking protective measures\" that moving the enriched uranium \"could be part of it.\" But he also emphasized that \"this is why it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to continue their indispensable work as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brennan pushed Grossi that since it's unclear if the uranium had been moved and all the centrifuges cannot be accounted for, there's an open question that Iran could still \"sprint towards a bomb\u2026if they wanted to.\" Grossi said he didn't want to be an \"alarmist,\" but \"we need to be in a position to ascertain, to confirm what is there, and where is it and what happened.\"",
      "\"Iran had a very vast ambitious program, and part of it may still be there, and if not, there is also the self-evident truth that the knowledge is there,\" Grossi said. \"The industrial capacity is there. Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. So you cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have. It's a huge country, isn't it? So I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military operations or not, you are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily.\"",
      "Grossi confirmed that his IAEA inspectors were never able to verify Iran's claims that its nuclear program was only for peaceful ends and that it was not trying to develop a weapon.",
      "\"We didn't see a program that was aiming in that direction, but at the same time, they were not answering very, very important questions that were pending,\" Grossi said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Saturday that there were calls in Iran for the arrest and execution of Grossi.",
      "When asked about alleged threats against nuclear inspectors, Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, said in a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation\" that Iran is not threatening nuclear inspectors, including Grossi.",
      "Nuclear inspectors \"are in Iran,\" Iravani said. He said they are in a \"safe condition,\" but \"they cannot have access to our site.\"",
      "Iravani also said that since Iran is a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), nuclear \"enrichment is our right, and an inalienable right, and we want to implement this right.\"",

It means that the right of one side will be the obligation of the other side. In the NPT, it has been defined that we have two very explicit right. The first is that we can have research on development, we can have the production of uranium, and we can have, to use, the peaceful energy. And the second right is that the legal protection by the IAEA for our activity and technical cooperation for our development program.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you do plan to restart enrichment, that sounds like?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: I think that enrichment will not- never stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when you mentioned NPT, just for our listeners, you're talking about some of the international agreements Iran has made with the UN on nonproliferation and safeguards. You mentioned the UN nuclear inspectors. Secretary of State Marco Rubio released a statement yesterday saying that there were calls in Iran, this, I believe, is from a newspaper that the Supreme Leader oversees, accusing our prior guest, Rafael Grossi, of being an Israeli spy and calling for his arrest and execution. To be clear, is Iran threatening UN inspectors?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: No, there is no any threat. It is a very clear law of the- our parliament that they have been suspended, our cooperation with IAEA, because the agency has not implemented their rights, their responsibility. Due to this it is a conditional law, and as long as this condition has not been set, so our cooperation with IAEA will be suspended. But whenever it set out as according to the law, so we can have- resume our cooperation. But there is no any threat against the general director of the IAEA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that was published in Israel- in Iran's \"Kayhan\" newspaper. Your foreign minister did also say that the IAEA and Grossi himself are malign in intent. Are the IAEA personnel, are the inspectors already inside Iran safe? And can they go back to their work of inspecting your sites?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: Exactly. They are in Iran. They are in the safe condition, but the activity has been suspended. They cannot have accesses to our site, but maybe some one, it is individual, opinion of the people that may criticize the IAEA or threat the general director. But we criticize IAEA. We- our assessment is that they have not done their jobs, so they failed and they prepared [inaudible] for such aggression against us.",

Mr. Ambassador, is Tehran planning to drop this demand of indirect communication with the United States, and will you begin speaking with the Trump administration?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: See you, we were in the negotiation, but because we know that any dispute between Iran and United States or other parts of the JCPOA cannot be resolved without the negotiation and using the peaceful means for- to resolve this dispute. So we are in the negotiation, and we are ready for the negotiation, but after this aggression, it is not proper condition for a new round of the negotiation, and there is no request for negotiation and meeting with the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the United States is wanting to meet with Iran to talk, and while the supreme leader issued a statement saying Iran had dealt the U.S. a slap in the face, after that, President Trump said he had actually stopped Israel from going further and had stopped Israel from an attempt to kill your supreme leader. Why not take the offer of a diplomatic lifeline? Because he seems to be offering one.",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: It is very gross violation of the international law that- threatening the Supreme Leader of Islamic Republic of Iran or any head of state, they have impunity from any attack. So we should understand that, what is the principle and condition for any negotiation? Negotiation is- has its- the principles, and it is a give and take process. So we should engage in the negotiation and discuss with each other, maybe we reach to a conclusion or not, but the unconditional surrender is not negotiation. It is dictating the policy toward us. If they are ready for negotiation, they will find us ready for that, but if they want to dictate us, it is impossible for any negotiation with them,",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, Pfizer board member and non-executive chairman of the board at Illumina, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 29, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look now at some of the changes to America's public health policies under the Trump administration, we're joined by former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who sits on the board at Pfizer and is now the Chairman of the Board at Illumina. Good morning. Good to see you.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Dr. Gottlieb, you worked in the first Trump administration. This second Trump administration seems very different in its approach to public health on a lot of fronts. One of them was really laid bare this week with this newly remade Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. Secretary Kennedy had dismissed about 17 members of the existing board and put in some members of his own choice. And in a video, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said federal immunization policy is, quote, 'no longer a credible process' and it's being politicized at the expense of children. That's a pretty stunning statement. Do you agree with the Academy of Pediatrics?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Look, you're right. I worked in the first Trump administration. I was fortunate to do that and proud to serve in that administration. I think we did a lot of important things on public health. We presided over the first cell and gene therapy approvals. The president tried to expand access to those treatments through the Right to Try legislation that he championed. He supported the FDA on an effort to try to keep tobacco products out of the hands of kids, record number of generic approvals, and a lot of other accomplishments. I think a lot of people on my side of the political aisle feel that a lot of these policies that Secretary Kennedy is championing are- are going to be contained to vaccines and not bleed into a broader public health doctrine. I think that's not right. I think there's a lot of people now who don't think these things are particularly political, or shouldn't be, and don't think these decisions should be politically decided, who are going to find when they go to the doctor's office that vaccines that they may want to protect their lives or the lives of their families aren't going to be available. This does look like a political process right now. The secretary is going after issues that have long been bugaboos of him and his anti-vax group, Children's Health Defense. I don't think that's mistakable at this point. I think that he would probably acknowledge that. That he's taking on issues that he's championed for the last 20 years to restrict access to certain vaccines. That's going to grow. The list is growing, and it's going to start to be very tangible for people and go well beyond just the COVID vaccine, which is, I think, what most people think about when they perceive this administration's, or the secretary's efforts, to try to restrict access to vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So one of the specific things from this meeting was advice to avoid flu vaccines containing an ingredient called thimerosal. Right around the same time as the meeting, the CDC removed information from its website that debunked claims that this ingredient was linked to autism. Secretary Kennedy says it's- it's journalists who are obscuring the truth. What do people need to know about the flu vaccine and this ingredient?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, so this is an old ingredient. It's a preservative used in multi-dose vials of flu vaccine, primarily. Only a very small percentage of flu vaccine vials still contain it. What it is is an ingredient that's added to multi-dose vials because those vials you're going to go in and out of with different needles as you administer the vaccine to different patients. So they're not single dose injections. They're multi-dose vials that primarily used in some busy clinics, almost exclusively in adults right now. Back in the early 2000s, I was at FDA when we reformulated the vaccine, so we compelled manufacturers to reformulate the vaccines to take this preservative out. Not because we thought it was unsafe, but because there was a lot of consternation among anti-vax groups that they thought that there was a link between this ingredient and autism. The ingredient does contain small amounts of ethylmercury, not methylmercury, ethylmercury, which is the same kind of mercury found in fish, in very small- very small amounts. And so we compelled the manufacturers to reformulate the vast majority of vaccines, still four percent of flu vaccines that get administered, mostly to adults, are from these multi-dose vials. This has long been a bugaboo of the secretary and his group, the Children's Health Defense Fund. In fact, the only presentation at the ACIP meeting was from the head of that group. And you're right that there was a countering analysis from the CDC officials asserting that there's no link between thimerosal and autism. That- that analysis was taken down from the website. The secretary put out a statement that said that it wasn't- it didn't go through proper review.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break, Dr. Gottlieb, and talk more with you on the other side of this. These are complicated issues I want to dig into with you. So we hope all of you will stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Dr. Gottlieb, just to pick back up, we were talking about the meeting that took place this past week with the newly reconstituted Advisory Committee on Immunization. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, you know him, he's a doctor. He has oversight and chairs the Health Committee. He called for the meeting to be canceled because he said there's no CDC director in place. And when it comes to these appointees, he said many of them 'do not have significant experience studying microbiology, epidemiology or immunology' and they may have 'preconceived bias' against mRNA vaccines. It's- I'm not a doctor, but it seems to me that experience in immunology would be important if you're advising on immunizations. His counsel was ignored here. Is there any check on Secretary Kennedy, at this point? Is there a need to get a CDC director in place quickly?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, well, the CDC director had a confirmation hearing this week, and hopefully she'll be in place soon. I think she's quite strong and a good pick for that job. The board, this ACIP board, isn't fully constituted. There's only seven members on the board. At its peak membership, it has about 15. And you're right, a lot of the people who have been appointed don't have deep experience, or any experience, quite frankly, in vaccine science. They are people who have been ideologically aligned with Secretary Kennedy in the past and worked with him, many of them, not all of them. And I think that that isn't something that even the secretary would probably dispute at this time, and it did lead to some awkward moments at that meeting. For example, you know, one member had to have explained to him the difference between an antibody prophylaxis and a vaccine. So there were evidence in that discussion where the CDC directors had to provide some, quite frankly, remedial assistance to help brief these members on the basis of vaccine science. So it did show, hopefully, once they fully constitute that board, you're going to get more balance on it. I think some people are skeptical. I remain hopeful that there will be some good members that get seated eventually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, one of the things about the American health system is that question of continued innovation. Earlier this month, the FDA approved a twice yearly injection of an HIV prevention drug called lenacapavir. How significant is an innovation like that, and given the environment you're talking about, will these new advisors get in the way of being able to get those kind of things to market?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, this shouldn't come before ACIP. So this is a therapeutic. It's a long acting antiviral that provides six months of protection against HIV and was extremely effective at preventing HIV infection in a population that was high risk of contracting HIV. So it's a change in the formulation of an antiviral that allows it to be administered just twice a year and provide sustained exposure to the benefits of that antiviral. We're seeing a lot of innovation like this. There was also news this week from a small biotech company that I don't have any involvement with, that they had developed a pill that could provide sustained protection against flu. So it's an antiviral, but it is formulated in a way where it- it could be administered once ahead of flu season, to provide protection across the entire season, and also look to be very effective. So we're seeing a lot of innovations like this. What I'm worried about is innovation in vaccine science. I work on the venture capital side, where we make investments in- in new companies, and there has been a pullback of biotech startups that have been looking to develop new vaccines, for example, vaccines for Epstein-Barr Virus, which we know is linked to certain B-cell lymphomas, and maybe is linked to multiple sclerosis. That- that's a new area of science, the potential to vaccinate children against that, much like we vaccinate kids against HPV right now and prevent cervical cancer and other types of cancers. Maybe in the future, we may be vaccinating for EBV, but there's been a lot of pullback to that kind of investment. So I think we're going to see less innovation in vaccine science as a result of the environment we're in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, Secretary Kennedy was asked this week about the declarations in some states to start removing fluoride from water. Oklahoma made some moves that direction. He said you're going to see 'probably slightly more cavities,' but 'there's a direct inverse correlation between the amount of fluoride in your water and your loss of IQ.' What should parents be thinking about when they hear things like that?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this has been a long standing issue, another issue that Secretary Kennedy has championed over his career, this perceived- perception that there's a link between fluoride and water and some neurotoxic effects of that. That's been studied thoroughly. It's been, I think, fully debunked. There's very small amounts of fluoride in water, and at the levels that it's put into the water supply, it's been demonstrated to be safe. CDC's- has data showing that there's a 25% reduction in dental caries as a result of fluoride that's added routinely to the water supply. It's not just a question of increased dental cavities, but also oral health more generally, which we know is correlated to systemic health.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Gottlieb, good to get your insight today. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Texas Republican Congressman Michael McCaul, good morning to you.",
      "REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL: Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your Republican colleagues in the Senate have been working hard on trying to get this bill together, and they're probably going to eek it past.",
      "REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's even with GOP lawmakers like Thom Tillis saying they can't stomach what this is going to do to Medicaid, an estimated $930 billion in cuts to it. That's more significant than what you all had voted to do in the House. Are you going to vote again for final passage if it looks like this?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: No, I'm going to vote for it for this reason. I think these numbers, it's all about waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid. What I'm voting for is a border security measure, $80 billion,\u00a0 $12 billion to reimburse states like mine. I'm voting for $150 billion that will go to our Department of Defense at a time when we saw with Iran, is desperately needed. The world is on fire, Eastern Europe, Indo-Pacific. And then the tax cuts. I mean, if we don't extend these tax cuts, it'll be the largest tax increase in American history for those three reasons. I'm a yes. I think everyone in the House, they know the peril they're in if they vote no on this thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean the peril they're in?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: I think, first of all, it's good for the nation. Secondly, they know that their-their jobs are at risk. Not just from the president, but from the voting- the American people. Our base back home will not reelect us to office if we vote no on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it about reelection, or is it about the policies, right?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: No-no. It's about- it's about- it's great for the country, and I've outlined the three top points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to help me understand then- you have such narrow margins in the house, and you look at these projections from like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, they say it violates the House instructions by $500 billion or more, what the Senate just put together here, and that deficits could rise more than $3 trillion. How do you get that through when you have fellow conservatives who are fiscal hawks and saying, I can't get with this, like Chip Roy?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Not to get into the weeds on the economics, but the dynamic scoring is not taken into account here by the Congressional Budget Office. That means that when you cut taxes, you actually get increased revenues to the Treasury. And that's something we saw under President Kennedy, under President Reagan, and under President Bush.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chip Roy and some of these other fiscal conservatives are going to come along for the ride?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Well, I think at the end of the day, I think they're going to vote for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do. Let's talk about some of the threats that you mentioned there, at home and abroad. You've been briefed on the actions against Iran. The IAEA director told us here that Iran has capabilities and could be up and running within a matter of months. Do you think it is an overstatement by the White House or a mistake to declare mission accomplished?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Well, first of all, I respect the IAEA. Their job is to inspect not to be an intelligence agency, so they don't really have the clear intelligence analysis that I would attribute to our intelligence community like the CIA. We met with Director Ratcliffe. It was not just his decision. These are career and intelligence officers that have been at the CIA for over 30 years that made this assessment that it was severely damaged and sets a program back a matter of years. In any event, the world and the Middle East is safer today than it was seven days ago, a week ago. That is highlighted by the fact that the proxies didn't light up. Russia didn't come to their- to their aid. China basically ran back for cover. Iran is on its own and psychologically, is very damaged. The deterrence is real. The damage is real. This is a masterful military operation, the likes of which I haven't seen since my father's war, World War Two.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on the homeland front, do you then dismiss these concerns about threats? You have the National Terrorism Advisory System that says there's a heightened threat environment in the US. After the strikes, there were federal agents that arrested 11 foreign nationals from Iran, including one who had ties to Hezbollah. Have you seen specific evidence of any kind of threat here in the United States, or is it, as you say, just done and over with?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: No, I have. We picked up 11 Iranians, one a sniper, one IRGC, another one, a known suspected terrorist, just within the last couple of days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Were they planning to do anything, or did they just happen to have those alliances from the past?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: You know, I don't know all the details, but I will tell you the FBI briefed me in a defensive briefing after Soleimani was killed. I was a part of that--",
      "REP. MCCAUL: -- back in 2020--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- that I was under indictment in Iran and that I was on that top target list. So, you know, look- is it imminent? I don't know. We have to take it seriously that there could be sleeper cells in the United States, that could go after people like Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, you know- you know- myself and others that were involved in that decision making and including the president of the United States. We know he's been targeted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to detention of migrants here in the United States, it's a high 59,000 detainees, according to ICE. 47% of them, though, lack a criminal record, fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes. Doesn't that show that the numbers- these aren't the worst of the worst.",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Yeah, I was a federal prosecutor for many years. Counterterrorism. You have to prioritize, right? I would prioritize the aggravated felons that my Mayorkas let in, in defiance of federal law. It was shall detain. He said, may detain and let them out into the streets. I would, I would prioritize that first.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you would prefer that Homeland Security prioritize them and not run up the numbers the way they are in this--",
      "REP. MCCAUL: I think they're running the numbers up because 15 to 20 million people came under the- under the Biden administration, and they're trying to get some sanity involved in the United States. And I think deterrence is the key here. And Margaret, it is working. You know, the apprehension rate at the border, and Texas is the biggest one, has gone down to almost zero. I mean, the border is just about secure, catch and release is over, and the threats are going away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike McCaul, Congressman, thank you very much for your insights today.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin today with Virginia Democrat Mark Warner. He is the Vice Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Good morning.",
      "SEN. MARK WARNER: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been, probably, sleep-deprived with all of what is happening, but I want to ask you about what's going on in Capitol Hill. Republicans are going to pass this along party lines. It's expected, right? But, it includes things in here that Democrats, including you, had supported, right? The no taxes on tips provision, more money for Border Patrol, expansion of the Child Care Tax Credit upwards of $2,000. Why vote against it, when there are popular provisions within it, and doesn't that just allow the President to say, oh, you want to raise taxes?",
      "SEN. WARNER: You can put as much lipstick on this pig as you want. This will- this will be a political albatross for the Republicans --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Why? --",
      "SEN. WARNER: \u00a0-- because it takes 16 million Americans off of health care coverage with cuts to Medicaid, and cuts to the Obamacare marketplace. That will move us, as a nation, back to the same percentage of uninsured we had before- before Obamacare. And, it's not like these people are not going to get sick. They're going to show up at the emergency room. Rural hospitals are going to shut down. That has been evidenced across the nation. It also goes after food assistance. So we are really in such a place that we're cutting, in my state, a couple hundred thousand people off of school lunches, school breakfasts. They even cut food banks. It's- it's cruel. They have also ended up, at the end of the day, cutting 20,000-plus clean energy jobs. And for what? This was to make sure that the highest, most wealthy Americans can get an extra tax-break. And, as you just saw on your chyron, there, it adds $4.5 trillion to the debt. I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this, and we'll see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their convictions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some of the Republicans are arguing, well, we have to deal with these entitlements and the work requirements and things that may lead to some of the lack of qualifications you talk about. They're not that burdensome. It's volunteer work or part-time work. So, are you overstating it?",
      "SEN. WARNER: No. It's 16 million Americans off of health care. You know, Medicaid cuts- these numbers, they're not my numbers. They're all independent sources. And what- the thing that I don't think people have realized is people say, well, Medicaid, I'm not poor. I, maybe, buy my health insurance through the marketplace. Your rates will go up $800 or $900 a month. And that will trickle through the whole rest of the healthcare market, because if you suddenly take people out of the system, they show up at the emergency room in uncompensated care. The only way those costs get passed on, is higher health insurance to all of us who have traditional coverage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, if this is so against their own interest, why haven't you been able to peel more Republicans away?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I think we'll see. Even as recently as just an hour ago, some of the special Medicaid provisions for certain states, I think, were disallowed because of the so-called Byrd Rule. It's not over until it's over. I will give you- I will grant that President Trump has been able to hold his party in line in an unprecedented manner. At the other end, this bill will come back and bite them. This is going to do so much damage in terms of, not only health care, food assistance, you know, the whole notion that we are moving towards cleaner energy jobs, all on the chopping block, adding $4 trillion to the debt.\u00a0Tell me, at the end of the day, how that is good for America? I don't think you can make the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Education is another front in this fight with the President. And I want to ask you about what's happening in Virginia. We saw the University of Virginia's President, James Ryan, resign on Friday. This was extraordinary. This was a pressure campaign from the Trump administration over diversity, or so-called DEI programs. In the letter, and I want to read this, Ryan wrote that if he had tried to fight back, hundreds of employees would lose jobs, researchers would lose funding, and hundreds of students could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld. But, he resigned to avoid this. Is that now the playbook for other university presidents: walk away, don't have the fight?",
      "SEN. WARNER: This is the most outrageous action, I think, this crowd has taken on education. We have great public universities in Virginia. We have a very strong governance system, where we have an independent board of visitors appointed by the Governor. Jim Ryan had done a very good job; just completed a major capital campaign. For him to be threatened, and, literally, there was indication that they received the letter that if he didn't resign on a day last week, by five o'clock, all these cuts would take place. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- It was that explicit? --",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- It was that explicit. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is- but that sounds personal. That doesn't sound specific to policy or changes. Like, how does the next university president get in line and get the money?",
      "SEN. WARNER: You're shocked it's coming- personal attacks are coming out of this administration? This is, you know- I thought the Republicans were about states' rights. I thought the Republicans were about, let's transfer more power in the States. This federal D.O.E. and Department of Justice should get their nose out of University of Virginia. They are doing damage to our flagship university. And if they can do it here, they'll do it elsewhere. At the end of the day, I understand that, with so many things at stake, that the idea, and I think Jim Ryan laid it out, that he was going to make his personal- personal job more important than these cuts. But, boy, that shouldn't have been the choice.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and we know that the universe that the administration is looking at more universities, and the assistant A.G., Harmeet Dhillon, indicated that publicly, and University of California is next to the crosshairs, so we're going to be watching that carefully --",
      "SEN. WARNER: They all want to make them like Harvard. They want to take on public universities, the way they have now taken on the Ivys. End of the day, this is going to hurt our\u00a0universities, chase away what world-class talent. And, frankly, if we don't have some level of academic freedom, then what kind of country are we?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your oversight role on intelligence. You were briefed on what's going on with Iran. You said you fear the American people are being given a false sense of comfort with these declarations of mission accomplished. Do you believe U.S. intelligence knows how much of a capability Iran maintains now?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I don't think we have final assessments. Let me- first of all, we don't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Secondly, the military performed an extraordinary mission, and I think they affected a great deal of damage to Iran's facilities. But, the idea that the President of the United States, with no data, two hours after the strike, is suddenly hitting the standard of saying total obliteration. That leads us to think that they are out of the game, and we don't know that yet. And, let's just be clear, you can actually set back the major program where they were trying to create, potentially, and there'd been no decision made by the Ayatollah to actually move towards weaponization, but where they could have a weaponized system with a dozen-plus missiles that are nuclear warned. But what they don't know is they didn't, and this was appropriate, I'm not criticizing the administration; they didn't go after the enriched uranium that was Isfahan, at that base, because it's buried so deeply --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- They just hit it with Tomahawks, not the bunker-busters --",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- So, the fact that they can have, still, enriched uranium, they may have some ability to still cascade that- means they could\u00a0still move forward on something, that might be not delivered by a missile, but a bomb in a trunk of a car. And all I don't want is the American people, or, for that matter, our allies in the region, to rely on a term that was set by the President before he had any facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Point taken there on the specifics of the rudimentary bomb. But, coming back to what you just said, there had been no decision by the Supreme Leader to make a weapon. Secretary of State Rubio, on this program, last Sunday, told me it was irrelevant, the answer to that question, because Iran had everything it needed to make and build a weapon. So, based on what you know, was there an emergency? Was there a reason the US had to act in the moment it did?",
      "SEN. WARNER:\u00a0 We were on the verge of what could have been a much greater war, in terms of Iran and Israel spreading to the whole region. Was there the imminent emergency that would trigger? Because lots of presidents have looked at taking this action, I think that's- that's very debatable. If, at the end of the day, we end up where this peace holds, and Iran doesn't strike back, Hallelujah. But, what we don't know, for example, is Iran going to try to hit us on cyber with this administration cutting, literally, half of our cyber-security personnel in this country? So, I just want to make sure that we- we do this in a measured way. The military did great. We have set them back. But let's not pretend that they don't have any capabilities. And the only way we can get resolution on that, Margaret, and Secretary Rubio acknowledged this in the brief, is if we have boots on the ground with inspectors. That means we've got to go to diplomacy. If America and Iran start negotiating this week, face-to-face, that would be good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we were- we will talk to the man who directs those boots on the grounds, potentially, the inspectors later on in the program from the IAEA. Thank you very much, Senator. We're going to have to leave it there. We'll be back in a moment.",

    "summary": "President Trump raised expectations last week when he told reporters in the Oval Office that there could be a ceasefire agreement within the next week.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Sunday pleaded for progress in ceasefire talks that would halt the fighting in the 20-month-long conflict in Gaza. The call for a deal came as the Israeli military ordered a new mass evacuation in northern Gaza amid its escalating attacks on the territory.",
      "\"MAKE THE DEAL IN GAZA. GET THE HOSTAGES BACK!!!\" Mr. Trump wrote early Sunday on his social media platform, Truth Social, in between posts about a Senate vote on his tax and spending cuts bill.",
      "Mr. Trump raised expectations on Friday when he told reporters in the Oval Office that there could be a ceasefire agreement within the next week.",
      "\"We're working on Gaza and trying to get it taken care of.\"",
      "A top adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Cabinet Minister Ron Dermer, was set to travel to Washington this week for talks on a ceasefire, an Israeli official said.",
      "The official said plans were also being made for Netanyahu to travel to Washington in the coming weeks, a sign there may be movement on a new deal. The official declined to discuss the focus of the visit and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not yet been finalized.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly called for Israel and Hamas to end the nearly two-year war in the Gaza Strip. Despite an eight-week ceasefire reached just as Mr. Trump took office in January, attempts to bring the sides toward a new agreement have failed, faltering over one major sticking point: whether the war should end as part of any ceasefire agreement.",
      "Mahmoud Merdawi, a Hamas official, accused Netanyahu of stalling progress on a deal, saying in remarks on the Telegram messaging app that the Israeli leader insists on a temporary agreement that would free just 10 of the hostages.",
      "Netanyahu spokesperson Omer Dostri said: \"Hamas was the only obstacle to ending the war,\" without addressing Merdawi's claim.",
      "Hamas says it is willing to free all the hostages in exchange for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops and an end to the war. Israel rejects that offer, saying it will agree to end the war if Hamas surrenders, disarms and goes into exile, something the group refuses.",
      "The\u00a0war in Gaza\u00a0began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas terrorists attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking roughly 250 hostage, about 50 of whom remain captive, with less than half believed to be alive.",
      "Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry on Sunday said an additional 88 people were killed by Israeli fire over the past 24 hours, raising the death toll to 56,500 in over 20 months of fighting. The ministry does not distinguish between militants and civilians in their count but says more than half of the dead are women and children.",
      "The Israeli military on Sunday ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians in large swaths of northern Gaza. Col. Avichay Adraee, a military spokesperson, posted the order on social media. It includes multiple neighborhoods in eastern and northern Gaza City, as well as the Jabaliya refugee camp.",
      "Trump slams Netanyahu corruption trial",
      "The Gaza message wasn't the only Middle East-related post by Mr. Trump this weekend. On Saturday evening, he doubled down on his criticism of the legal proceedings against Netanyahu, who is on trial for alleged corruption, calling it \"a POLITICAL WITCH HUNT, very similar to the Witch Hunt that I was forced to endure.\" \u00a0It comes just days after the president intervened to support Netanyahu's attack on Iran's nuclear program, using special U.S. bunker buster bombs.",
      "In the post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the trial interfered with talks on a Gaza ceasefire.",
      "\"(Netanyahu) is right now in the process of negotiating a Deal with Hamas, which will include getting the Hostages back. How is it possible that the Prime Minister of Israel can be forced to sit in a Courtroom all day long, over NOTHING,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The post echoed similar remarks Mr. Trump made last week when he called for the trial to be canceled. Legal experts say it is unusual for a close ally of one state to interfere so directly in the domestic affairs of another, especially when it concerns an ongoing court case.",
      "The trial has repeatedly been postponed at the request of Netanyahu, citing security and diplomatic developments. On Sunday, the court agreed to call off two more days of testimony by Netanyahu scheduled this week.",

      "Wedding location details were kept under wraps, but Italian newspapers and Venetian locals predicted it would take place at San Giorgio Maggiore, one of the Venetian islands, which is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore. Bezos and Sanchez invited some 200 guests, and many were seen boarding water taxis to the island for Friday's festivities.",
      "This is the second marriage for both Bezos, 61, and S\u00e1nchez, 55. Bezos was previously married to\u00a0philanthropist Mackenzie Scott, but the pair divorced in 2019. S\u00e1nchez's first marriage to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of the talent firm Endeavor, also ended in 2019.",
      "Ahead of the nuptials, movie stars, TV personalities and business titans were sighted around Venice. Some were seen arriving on Thursday at the Madonna dell'Orto church for the first of several planned events. Some of the more recognizable names seen in photos include Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, the Kardashians and Jenners, Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Tom Brady, Bill Gates, Diane von Furstenberg, Usher, Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.",
      "The influx of so much money and star power prompted protests from local Venetian residents, who launched the \"No Space for Bezos\" campaign. It comes amid a\u00a0broader pushback against an overload of tourists across Europe, with some blaming the crowds of visitors for increased costs and rent.",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 16:26:47 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers said their findings suggest husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage \u2013 suggesting a female dominance.",
    "story": [
      "An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a \"matriarchal society\" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published\u00a0in Science this week.",
      "Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a \"Mother Goddess\" cult and signs of a matriarchal society.",
      "A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building.",
      "During the early years in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said.",
      "Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males.",
      "\"We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line \u2014 a matrilineal system,\" study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and\u00a0found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the\u00a0journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said upon the release of their findings, \"It is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

They pointed out that the jury heard testimony, saw texts, viewed bank records and heard audio showing the rapper committing crime after crime for decades. According to the prosecution, the government showed that Diddy didn\u2019t take no for an answer.

      "However, the defense did find a way to show the jury a different explanation in an attempt to undermine the government's argument. \"Defense got an employee of one of the companies to say that Diddy was just buying the escorts' time and not any sexual performance, which the jury could use as a basis to acquit Diddy on the transportation charges,\" Faddis, a founding partner of Colorado-based Varner Faddis, said.",

That could lead to a hung jury on one or more of the charges. But the jurors spent the entire trial waiting to see how Diddy's lawyers rebutted the massive case against him, and they merely rested without putting on any witnesses. That leaves the jury picking through the government's case to see if this really rises to racketeering, and if not, they may hang or acquit on some of the charges \u2013 but it's unlikely.\"",

      "\"The prosecution can withstand an acquittal or a hung jury on some of the counts, but the prosecutors really need a conviction for racketeering to claim total victory,\" Day added. \"Again, that can be a difficult charge to convict on if the jurors don't buy the theory that this entire business empire was engaged in sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. But the defense needed to have convinced at least one juror that the case wasn't there, and that witnesses were lying to save their own necks.

      "\"Despite that, we are trying our best to contemplate and adjust for any possible additional information, but sometimes that is not possible.\"",
      "The study was limited to a region with hot and humid summers, specifically southern Minnesota and western Wisconsin, where golf courses may have applied pesticides with more frequency compared to other geographic regions.",

      "Open 24/7 and installable in under a week,\u00a0VenHub is designed for high-traffic environments, such as transit centers, airports, and city hubs, where speed, security, and efficiency are in high demand. Instead of relying on cashiers or attendants, VenHub uses two industrial robotic arms, named Barb and Peter, to handle all product selection and delivery. The process is simple yet futuristic.",
      "Customers place their orders through the VenHub app, pay digitally, and receive a QR code. Upon arrival at the store, the customer scans the code at a secure pickup window. One of the robotic arms then retrieves the items from storage and delivers them to the window within about 90 seconds. The entire transaction is seamless, contactless, and designed to eliminate the frustrations of traditional vending machines or checkout lines.",

      "AI HUMANOID ROBOT IS CHANGING THE WAY YOU BUY CARS AT DEALERSHIPS",
      "The technology powering VenHub",
      "VenHub's foundation is a sophisticated blend of robotics, artificial intelligence, and real-time analytics. The robotic arms are similar to those used in automotive manufacturing, engineered for speed, precision, and reliability. Rather than attempting to mimic human appearance, these arms are optimized for repetitive, high-accuracy tasks that are perfect for retail fulfillment.",
      "Artificial intelligence drives every aspect of store operations. AI algorithms manage inventory by tracking purchasing patterns, adjusting stock levels, and predicting demand based on time of day, location, and customer behavior. Machine vision allows the robots to accurately identify products and handle them with minimal errors or downtime. The entire system is connected through IoT sensors, providing real-time data on inventory, system health, and order status. This data-driven approach enables VenHub to operate efficiently, minimize waste, and ensure popular items are always available.",
      "From the customer's perspective, everything is managed through a mobile app. This app handles payment, order tracking, and pickup notifications, creating a frictionless and transparent shopping experience.

The rapid setup time enables these stores to quickly appear in busy locations, ranging from transportation hubs to college campuses and urban centers. Since the store operates around the clock without breaks, it maximizes both convenience for shoppers and revenue for operators. Eliminating on-site staff dramatically reduces overhead, allowing for competitive pricing and improved profitability.",
      "Security is a major focus for VenHub. The store uses bulletproof glass to protect inventory and customers. If one robot requires maintenance, the other can take over, ensuring reliable service with minimal downtime. VenHub's design is also environmentally conscious, featuring compact, energy-efficient layouts and optional solar power compatibility to reduce its carbon footprint. Each store can be customized to fit local demand, whether that means stocking snacks, electronics, or other essentials.",

      "The human factor: Are robots replacing jobs or creating new ones?",
      "A common concern with automation is the impact on jobs. VenHub's robots do replace some traditional retail roles, but the company emphasizes that new opportunities are emerging. Skilled workers are needed to maintain, restock, and support the automated systems, shifting the workforce toward higher-paying, tech-focused positions. This trend reflects a broader shift in the economy, where automation often transforms jobs rather than eliminating them.",

      "VenHub smart store pricing and ownership: What you need to know",
      "If you're considering bringing a VenHub Smart Store to your city, here's a quick breakdown of the costs and what's included. The price for a VenHub Smart Store ranges from $250,000 to $275,000, depending on your chosen configuration. To secure your spot in the production queue, you'll need a $2,500 pre-order deposit, which is fully refundable up until production begins. Financing is available through select financial institutions, with some buyers qualifying for up to 100% financing. However, all arrangements are handled directly between you and the lender; VenHub does not influence approval decisions.",
      "Once you own a VenHub Smart Store, it's yours outright; there are no leases or franchise agreements. You have complete control over pricing, inventory, and restocking, and you can manage replenishment yourself or use VenHub's preferred fulfillment partners. A monthly software-as-a-service fee of $2,500 covers software updates, AI analytics, remote monitoring, and cloud-based management tools. If you require additional support, an optional maintenance package is available for $1,300 per month, which includes servicing and preventive care.",
      "VenHub does not secure locations for you, but they do offer guidance on choosing high-traffic spots, such as shopping centers, universities, business districts, or commuter hubs, to help maximize your store's performance. With high demand and expanding production capacity, VenHub is working to deliver stores to new owners as quickly as possible across the country.",

Watching robots like Barb and Peter grab your order in just seconds is pretty impressive, but what's even more remarkable is that this technology is already making shopping quicker, safer, and a whole lot easier. As these smart stores start popping up in more places across the country, they might totally change not just how we shop. It's interesting to consider that this kind of smart, connected retail experience could soon become something we all use every day, without even thinking twice about it.",

The area's historic significance also means that any mistake could damage irreplaceable architecture, including the 1928 \"great hall\" that once housed a patriotic night school.",

      "Instead of using cranes or bulldozers, engineers put 432 small walking robots to work. These robots gently lift the building and slowly move it forward, inch by inch, covering about 33 feet each day. To achieve this incredible level of precision, the project relies on several advanced technologies. Special low-clearance drilling robots, which can be operated remotely, navigate tight corridors and doorways to create new foundations beneath the historic structure.",
      "Earth-moving robots equipped with folding mechanical arms, just under four feet wide, use artificial intelligence to tell the difference between clay and solid obstacles. Engineers also use building information modeling and point cloud scanning to create highly detailed 3D blueprints. These digital models help the team plan exact movement routes, avoid potential collisions and design curved paths for removing soil.",
      "To keep the construction site efficient and minimize disruption, soil is carried out using a conveyor belt system, much like an assembly line. The move is only temporary. Once the underground construction is finished, the Huayanli complex will be carefully returned to its original spot, fully restored and preserved, now sitting atop a modern underground facility.",

One term you might be familiar with is software as a service (SaaS), a model by which software is accessed online through a subscription rather than installed on individual machines.",

      "Several data breaches have been traced back to vulnerabilities at these third-party service providers.

The breach involved sensitive health information belonging to over 5 million people in the United States. The company first noticed suspicious system activity Feb. 6, 2025, but the actual compromise began ten days earlier.",

      "The healthcare industry has embraced cloud-based services to improve efficiency, scale operations and reduce overhead. Companies like Episource enable healthcare payers to manage coding and risk adjustment at a much larger scale. But this shift has also introduced new risks. When third-party vendors handle patient data, the security of that data becomes dependent on their infrastructure.",
      "Healthcare data is among the most valuable types of personal information for hackers. Unlike payment card data, which can be changed quickly, medical and identity records are long-term assets on the dark web. These breaches can lead to insurance fraud, identity theft and even blackmail.",
      "Episource is not alone in facing this kind of attack. In the past few years, several healthcare SaaS providers have faced breaches, including Accellion and Blackbaud. These incidents have affected millions of patients and have led to class-action lawsuits and stricter government scrutiny.",

      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.",
      "These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "What makes this breach especially alarming is that many of the affected patients may have never even heard of Episource. As a business-to-business vendor, Episource operates in the background, working with insurers and healthcare providers, not with patients directly. The people affected were customers of those companies, yet it's their most sensitive data now at risk because of a third party they never chose or trusted. This kind of indirect relationship muddies the waters when it comes to responsibility and makes it even harder to demand transparency or hold anyone accountable.",

      "Bypassing filters: Because these emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s servers (service@paypal.com), they pass all security checks and appear legitimate in your inbox.",
      "Lack of suspicion: Some versions contain no phishing links at all, just a scammer\u2019s phone number, making them even harder to detect.",

      "Phishing email sent from\u00a0service@paypal.com (Reddit)",
      "In a newer and more sophisticated twist, scammers are removing links altogether. Instead, they include a phone number and ask you to call. Once you do, you\u2019re connected with a fake PayPal representative who says they need to verify your identity. They then instruct you to download what appears to be a PayPal-branded support tool, but really it\u2019s a customized remote access app hosted on a different server.

      "How scammers are hijacking PayPal\u2019s system to send fake alerts",
      "This part is still a bit of a mystery. With typical PayPal invoice scams, content is tightly controlled, which means you normally can\u2019t change the email structure or messaging. However, these new emails suggest that scammers may be exploiting internal features, like business tools or API fields, to sneak custom content into PayPal-generated alerts. It\u2019s not just phishing, it\u2019s weaponizing a legitimate system to create trust and evade detection.",
      "Why this PayPal phishing attack is so dangerous",
      "This scam is especially effective and dangerous because the emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s official servers, making it difficult to distinguish them from legitimate messages. Since the sender address and branding are authentic, recipients are more likely to trust the communication without suspicion.",
      "The scammers also use urgent language that creates a sense of panic, such as warnings about unauthorized activity or large charges. This pressure encourages people to act quickly and often before fully considering whether the alert is genuine.",

      "4. Check your account manually: If you\u2019re ever in doubt, just log into your PayPal account directly. Review\u00a0recent activity and see if anything looks off. There is no need to rely on alerts alone.",
      "5. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward suspicious PayPal messages to phishing@paypal.com. You can also\u00a0report phishing attempts to the FTC.",
      "6.

      "The magic behind\u00a0Kara Pod is its ability to extract moisture from the air, even if you live in a dry climate or keep your home air conditioned. The process starts when the device pulls in ambient air. Inside, advanced materials capture the water vapor in the air. That moisture is then heated to kill any microbes, and it passes through a dual-stage UV sterilization system and a carbon filter to remove impurities, bacteria and particles.",
      "Once the water is purified, the Kara Pod adds essential minerals like calcium, magnesium and sodium. This turns into healthy, mineral-rich water that is ready to drink or brew with. The device can make up to 3.2 liters, which is about a gallon, of premium alkaline water every day. This water is stored in an internal tank that is always kept topped up so you never have to worry about running out or refilling it yourself.",

The company's CEO has explained that the device cannot be used without the mineralizer because prolonged consumption of distilled water may not be suitable for your health.

She made it clear that if New York wants to keep fossil fuels in check and meet its climate goals, nuclear energy has to be part of the mix. The new plant is expected to generate at least one gigawatt of electricity, which is enough to power about a million homes.

Victims may be told to stay on the phone while buying the cards or to scratch off the back and send a photo of the code right away. That sense of pressure is designed to override second thoughts. If anyone you do not know asks for payment in gift cards, it is a scam. No legitimate organization or contest will ever ask for them as payment or verification.",

Once they have your attention, they use that trust to steal money or personal information. Musk is one of the most frequently impersonated figures in scam campaigns.

      "1. Never send gift card codes to anyone you do not know: If someone asks for Apple, Amazon or Google Play cards as payment or verification, it is a scam. No real prize, agency or company will request gift cards.",
      "2. Be skeptical of prize claims from celebrity accounts: Musk is not messaging people on Facebook to give away Teslas or cash. If the profile is unverified or the offer feels random, trust your instincts and ignore it.",
      "3. Do not move conversations to private apps like WhatsApp or Telegram: Scammers often push for this because these platforms have fewer safeguards, no public comment threads and limited reporting tools. Once the chat moves off Facebook, it becomes much harder to verify or report what\u2019s happening. If someone you do not know insists on switching platforms, it\u2019s usually a sign they are hiding something.",
      "4. Consider using a data removal service: If a scammer has targeted you or impersonated you online, chances are your personal information is floating around on data broker websites. These sites collect and sell everything from your home address to your family members\u2019 names, making you a bigger target for future scams. Data removal services can help you scan the web and request the deletion of your info from these brokers. While you can do this manually, it\u2019s time-consuming. Services like\u00a0Incogni offer subscriptions that automate the process and monitor for new exposures. If you\u2019ve been scammed or suspect your information was leaked, using a data removal service adds another layer of protection and peace of mind.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Scammers often use emotional triggers to override your judgment. If something feels off or too convenient, it probably is.",
      "6. Install strong antivirus software on all devices: Some impersonation scams include links to phishing pages or malware. Antivirus tools can block these threats before they reach your inbox. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Security researchers emphasize that this isn't the result of a new, single breach. Instead, it's a massive collection of previously stolen credentials from various past leaks, phishing scams and third-party data exposures, some of which were forgotten, underreported or reshared.",

This makes the scope of the exposure particularly dangerous because attackers can use this central trove for targeted attacks, including credential stuffing.",

This technique involves using stolen login details across multiple sites, exploiting the fact that many users reuse the same credentials.

      "1. Use a password manager: Infostealer malware often targets passwords saved directly in web browsers, making them easy targets. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager that offers zero-knowledge architecture and military-grade encryption to keep your data safe. The best options work across all your devices and browsers, offer secure sharing, monitor for data breaches, and even generate health reports on your passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking, and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails, and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats, or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0 Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: The massive leak of 16 billion credentials shows just how far your personal information can spread and how easily it can resurface years later in aggregated hacker databases. Even if your passwords were part of an old breach, data like your name, email, phone number, or address may still be available through data broker sites. Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure by scrubbing this information from hundreds of these sites. While no service can guarantee total removal, they drastically reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to cross-reference leaked credentials with public data to impersonate or target you. These services monitor and automatically remove your personal info over time, which gives me peace of mind in today\u2019s threat landscape.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "How BeBot works: Tech specs and core features",
      "BeBot operates entirely on electric power, relying on batteries and, in some versions, solar panels. This approach ensures there are no emissions, so the robot does not contribute to greenhouse gases or other forms of pollution. Unlike traditional gas-powered beach-cleaning equipment such as tractors, BeBot is quiet and unobtrusive, which allows it to work at any time without disturbing wildlife or beach visitors. Its cleaning capacity is impressive. BeBot can cover up to 32,200 square feet of beach in a single hour, which is 20 to 30 times more effective than manual trash collection. The robot can remove up to 200 pounds of debris in one session, targeting items like plastic bottles, cigarette butts, food packaging, and cotton buds. BeBot's design allows it to dig up to about four inches into the sand, and its sifting grids, which measure roughly half an inch by half an inch, capture even the smallest pieces of plastic and trash that would be difficult for people to collect by hand.",
      "Remote operation is another standout feature. BeBot can be controlled from up to 950 feet away, giving operators the flexibility to clean large or crowded beaches safely. Its unique track system distributes pressure evenly across the sand, which helps prevent beach erosion and protects sensitive habitats such as turtle nesting sites. The robot's battery can last up to three hours on a full charge, and some models can run for as long as eight hours.",

      "Beyond trash: Versatility and attachments",
      "BeBot is not limited to trash collection. Its modular design supports a variety of attachments, allowing it to rake seaweed and algae, level sand, and carry heavy loads such as beach chairs, umbrellas, or even jet skis. With the sifter removed, BeBot can transport up to 900 pounds, making it a valuable tool for both public and private beaches, nature reserves, golf courses, and other sandy environments.",

      "Hackers are using Captchas to infect your PC with malware",
      "ClickFix, a social engineering tactic that has been targeting both Windows and Mac users since early 2024, continues to evolve.",
      "Just last month, I reported on how attackers were using fake CAPTCHA prompts to\u00a0trick Windows users into installing malware themselves.",
      "Now, that same trick is being turned against macOS. Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new campaign using ClickFix to deliver Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), a powerful information-stealing malware targeting Apple systems.",
      "SPOT FAKE ONLINE STORES, AVOID FACEBOOK SUBSCRIPTION SCAMS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ClickFix malware, and how does it work?",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0CloudSEK have identified a new threat targeting macOS users through imitation and deception. The campaign uses a technique known as ClickFix to lure victims through fake online verification prompts. This time, attackers are spoofing Spectrum, a major telecom provider in the United States. They use fraudulent domains that closely resemble Spectrum\u2019s real support portals. These include misleading addresses like panel spectrum net and spectrum ticket net.",
      "Visitors to these sites are shown a standard-looking CAPTCHA box, asking them to verify their identity. When they do, the site displays a fake error message that says the CAPTCHA failed. Users are encouraged to click a button labeled \"Alternative Verification.\" This triggers a command to be copied silently to their clipboard. What happens next depends on the user\u2019s operating system. On macOS, instructions guide the user to paste and run the command in Terminal. That command is actually a shell script designed to steal information and download malware.",
      "The script is particularly dangerous because it uses legitimate macOS system commands. It asks for the system password, harvests credentials and disables security protections. It then downloads AMOS. This is a known information stealer with a history of targeting Apple devices. The malware collects sensitive data like passwords, cryptocurrency wallet keys, browser autofill data and saved cookies.",
      "Researchers believe the campaign was created by Russian-speaking attackers. Clues include comments written in Russian found within the malware\u2019s code. Analysts also noted that the delivery infrastructure was poorly assembled. Mismatched instructions appeared across devices. For example, Linux users were shown Windows commands. Mac users were told to press keys that only exist on Windows machines.",

      "Fake Captcha on a Mac. (CloudSEK)",
      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Why ClickFix attacks are so effective",
      "ClickFix is a social engineering method that has rapidly gained popularity among cybercriminals. It relies on users trusting what they see and blindly following simple instructions. In this campaign, the attacker\u2019s goal is to make the victim execute the infection process themselves. Once the user follows through, the system is compromised without needing a traditional exploit.",
      "Researchers believe ClickFix has been active since at least March 2024. I first reported on it in June 2024, when\u00a0attackers used fake error messages from Google Chrome, Microsoft Word and OneDrive to push their payloads. Victims were shown prompts offering a \"fix,\" which copied a malicious PowerShell command to their clipboard. They were then instructed to paste and run it in PowerShell or through the Run dialog.",
      "By November 2024, the method had evolved further. A\u00a0new wave of attacks targeted Google Meet users, beginning with phishing emails that mimicked internal meeting invites. These emails contained links that redirected to fake Meet landing pages designed to look like they came from the victim\u2019s own organization.",

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of ClickFix malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures:",
      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks also start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser, and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email, or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets, or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Even experienced users can be tricked when malicious behavior is disguised as routine. The attack didn't just exploit a vulnerability in macOS, but also your familiarity with verification flows. As long as security instructions look like part of the usual experience, people will continue to run malicious code themselves. Mac users, like everyone else, need to treat every familiar-looking interface with a little more skepticism. Especially when it asks for your password.",

      "As lawmakers push forward with the sweeping One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the executive director and CEO of the oldest and largest organization of public safety communications professionals warns that its failure to include funding for Next Generation 911 (NG911) is a serious national security oversight with consequences for public safety.",

      "\"We know that cyberterrorists and threats are being directed against 911 today, and it\u2019s affecting us today,\" he said. \"Ransomware attacks have taken down 911 centers, police departments, fire departments, EMS agencies across the U.S. We need to stop that.\"",

      "\"Some states have invested in Next Generation 911 infrastructure and technologies. Others have done nothing,\" Maier said. \"That leaves us with haves and have-nots across the nation.

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in a post on X on May 6 that the opposition members, including Urruchurtu, had been rescued in \"a precise operation\" and brought to the U.S. A few weeks later, Rubio met with the released opposition members. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that Rubio had commended the Venezuelan opposition members for their \"bravery in the face of Maduro\u2019s relentless repression and tyranny.\"",
      "Neuer also expressed gratitude for the Trump administration and Rubio\u2019s actions, which led to Urruchurtu\u2019s release.",
      "\"Thank you to the Trump administration and the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, for their critical role in securing Pedro\u2019s release and the release of his comrades. Once again, proving that strong, principled diplomacy saves lives and advances the cause of freedom for the world,\" Neuer told Fox News Digital.",

    "summary": "The Republican-controlled Senate began voting on amendments to President Donald Trump's massive tax cut and spending bill, with the goal of passing it later in the day.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Entering the final stretch of an arduous process, the Republican-controlled Senate began voting Monday on amendments to President Donald Trump's massive tax cut and spending bill, with the goal of passing it later in the day.",
      "The 940-page legislation, which the Senate advanced on a 51-49 vote late Saturday, was still taking shape even as the \"vote-a-rama\" began \u2014 a process in which senators can offer an unlimited number of amendments \u2014 with GOP leaders hoping to use it to satisfy concerns from wavering factions.",
      "Republicans need to hold 50 of their 53 senators to pass the bill. They have lost Rand Paul, of Kentucky, who complained that it would add too much to the national debt, and Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, who blasted the Medicaid cuts as damaging to his home state.",
      "\u201cSo what do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off Medicaid?\u201d Tillis said in a fiery floor speech Sunday evening.",
      "Tillis said \u201camateurs\" are advising Trump and conflating long-standing health care policy with \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse.\u201d Hours earlier, he announced that he won't run for re-election in 2026 after having clashed with Trump over his opposition.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, voted to advance the bill Saturday but told NBC News on Monday she was still leaning against it on final passage. She expressed concerns with the Medicaid cuts and said she prefers raising taxes on high earners, calling those \u201ctwo of the most important things\u201d she wants addressed.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be a gazillion more amendments tonight,\u201d Collins said midafternoon.",
      "And Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who also voted to keep the process moving over the weekend after discussions with Republican leaders, voiced concerns Monday about the cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), health care and energy tax credits.",
      "\u201cI still have concerns about SNAP and Medicaid,\u201d Murkowski told reporters. \u201cThere are still pieces in the bill that are continuing to be reviewed. And so it has not yet been fully firmed in terms of some of the provisions. And so I want to know where they\u2019re going to end up.\u201d",
      "While Republicans voted down a number of Democratic-led amendments designed to take the bill off the floor and send it to committee, Collins and Murkowski notably voted for some of them, including one by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., to revise provisions on rural hospitals.",
      "In addition, a group of conservatives \u2014 Ron Johnson, R-Wis., Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Mike Lee, R-Utah \u2014\u00a0are insisting on revising the bill to reduce the deficit impact.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that the Senate bill would increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion over the next 10 years \u2014 it found that revenues would fall by about $4.5 trillion and spending would be cut by $1.2 trillion. The bill is also projected to lead to 11.8 million people\u2019s losing their health insurance by 2034 if it becomes law, the CBO said.",
      "The GOP is using a budget trick known as \u201ccurrent policy baseline\u201d to hide the cost of extending the tax cuts Trump signed into law in 2017, effectively lowering the sticker price by $3.8 trillion. That tactic hasn\u2019t been used in the budget process before, and it sets a precedent to weaken the Senate\u2019s 60-vote rule.",
      "The Senate voted 53-47 to greenlight the new baseline Monday, with all Republicans voting in favor.",
      "\u201cThis is the nuclear option,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., warning that it will \u201ccut both ways\u201d when the majority flips.",
      "The legislation would also slash taxes on tips and overtime pay. It includes a $150 billion boost to military spending this year, along with a surge in federal money to carry out Trump\u2019s mass deportation and immigration enforcement agenda. It would partly pay for that with cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and clean energy funding.",
      "And it includes a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling ahead of an August deadline to avert a default on the country\u2019s obligations.",
      "\"The permanent tax relief included in our bill means Americans keeping more of their hard-earned money and American businesses growing and investing in our country and our workers,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.",
      "The Senate version of the bill includes steeper Medicaid cuts than the House version, along with changes to the clean energy funding rollbacks. It would shorten the timeline for an expanded $40,000 state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to five years before cutting it back to $10,000. And it includes a series of provisions for priorities in Alaska, including a tax break for whaling captains, in an apparent attempt to win over Murkowski.",
      "The Monday vote-a-rama comes after a rare weekend work session for the Senate.",
      "On Saturday night, after hours of delays and uncertainty, the package for Trump's agenda cleared its first major hurdle, with Tillis and Paul joining all Democrats in opposition.",
      "The narrow but successful vote occurred after a small band of GOP holdouts \u2014 including Johnson, Scott and Lee \u2014 struck a deal with Thune over amendments. But those amendments still have to get majority votes to be adopted. Vice President JD Vance, a former senator, attended meetings in Thune's office and helped sway their votes, while Trump golfed and held his own meetings with key senators.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., forced a full reading of the bill, which delayed the process by about 16 hours. Democrats don't have the votes to sink the bill, as Republicans are using the filibuster-proof \"budget reconciliation\" process to get around the 60-vote threshold.",
      "\u201cThe Republicans are still in disarray. They\u2019re hiding from us all kinds of things,\u201d Schumer told reporters Monday. \u201cThey\u2019re doing all kinds of deals with other members \u2014 backroom deals, side deals \u2014 we have to see them. And they can\u2019t keep them secret from us, or the American people.\u201d",
      "If the bill passes the Senate, it would head to the House, which passed its own version May 22 by a single vote.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and his leadership team have told rank-and-file members over the weekend to be prepared to return to Washington as early as Tuesday, with a possible final vote on the Senate bill Wednesday.",
      "GOP leaders aim to send the bill to Trump's desk for his signature by his self-imposed July Fourth deadline, which is Friday.",
      "As in the Senate, Republican leaders in the House can afford only three GOP defections. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., has opposed the legislation from the start, arguing it would add to the debt. And a handful of moderate Republicans are sounding the alarm over Medicaid cuts to their district and the Senate's changes to the SALT deduction."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's sweeping domestic policy package that's moving through the Senate would affect virtually every American, overhauling tax, health care and energy policy.",
      "It renews the tax cuts Trump signed into law in his first term and pays for them in part with steep cuts to Medicaid, food aid programs and clean energy funding.",
      "But the sprawling package \u2014 which is likely to face substantial changes before a final vote in the Senate \u2014 also touches on a range of other policy issues, from artificial intelligence and space exploration to immigration.",
      "According to the latest projection from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, over the next 10 years, the legislation would cause revenues to decrease by about $4.5 trillion while cutting spending by $1.2 trillion, increasing the national debt by $3.3 trillion.",
      "Here's what's in the current version of the bill. All cost and savings estimates are from the new CBO analysis and cover a 10-year period.",
      "Tax cuts",
      "What it would do: Republicans are seeking to permanently extend the tax rates Trump signed into law in 2017, which are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Projected cost: $4 trillion.",
      "State and local tax deduction (SALT)",
      "What it would do: This provision, demanded by House Republicans who hail from high-tax blue states, would allow people to deduct up to $40,000 per year for five years from their federal taxes. The SALT deduction would phase out once an individual's annual income hits $500,000. As part of the compromise with Senate Republicans, the cap would go back to $10,000 per year after five years.",
      "Projected cost: $142 billion, according to Senate Budget Committee staff members.",
      "No tax on tips, overtime and car loans",
      "What it would do: The bill would exempt tips and overtime pay from federal income taxes, fulfilling two of Trump's campaign promises. It would also allow taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of auto loan interest for U.S.-made vehicles.",
      "The bill also features a temporary tax break of $6,000 for seniors that phases down as income increases.",
      "Projected cost: $150 billion.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "What it would do: Senate Republicans want to permanently increase the annual child tax credit to $2,200. House Republicans have proposed bumping it to $2,500 but scaling back to $2,000 after 2028.",
      "Projected cost: Estimates vary, but it would most likely cost hundreds of billions of dollars.",
      "Immigration enforcement",
      "What it would do: The package would provide Customs and Border Patrol with $46.5 billion to build the border wall and associated infrastructure, like access roads, cameras, lights and sensors. The package also includes $2 billion for the Department of Homeland Security and $29.9 billion for Immigration and Custom Enforcement.",
      "Projected cost: Around $150 billion.",
      "Military funding increase",
      "What it would do: The bill includes $25 billion for a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system, $29 billion for shipbuilding and $15 billion for nuclear deterrence, among other provisions.",
      "Projected cost: $153 billion.",
      "Medicaid cuts",
      "What it would do: Republicans targeted the Medicaid program, which 72 million people rely on for health coverage, by instituting work requirements of 80 hours per month for able-bodied adults under age 65, with exceptions including for parents of children under 14.",
      "The Senate goes further than the House did in restricting state-levied fees on health care providers that are primarily used to fund Medicaid, especially in underserved communities. Under the new change, the federal government would not be on the hook to reimburse states, and it would require many states to lower their existing rates. That would also affect the 41 states that voted to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "Projected savings: $930 billion.",
      "Medicare and Affordable Care Act cuts",
      "What it would do: The \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d Republicans say they targeted in Medicaid affected other health care safety net programs like Medicare and the Affordable Care Act.",
      "Projected savings: $170 billion.",
      "SNAP benefit cuts",
      "What it would do: Republicans would institute more work requirements for people who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps. Able-bodied adults under age 65 would be required to work 80 hours per month with exceptions for those with children under 10.",
      "Projected savings: $285 billion.",
      "Rollback of clean energy tax credits",
      "What it would do: The bill would roll back tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act that President Joe Biden signed into law, including for clean vehicles and electricity. That includes a last-minute total repeal of federal subsidies to wind and solar industries unless the projects were placed in service before the end of 2027. An additional tax would be phased in depending upon how much of the products are manufactured in China.",
      "The Senate's bill went even further than the version the House passed, despite complaints from some Republicans. They also added a tax incentive for coal production.",
      "Projected savings: $488 billion.",
      "Artificial intelligence",
      "What it would do: The bill would effectively bar states from making their own rules for artificial intelligence for five years as a condition for receiving federal broadband expansion funds.",
      "Republicans were split over this provision, and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, of Tennessee, negotiated with Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas, to bring the \u201ctemporary pause\u201d down from the 10 years.",
      "It also includes a carveout for laws related to unfair or deceptive acts or practices, child online safety, child sexual abuse material, rights of publicity and protection of a person\u2019s name, image, voice or likeness.",
      "Projected cost: The provision adds $25 million to an existing $500 million bucket for AI deployment.",
      "Space program funding",
      "What it would do: The bill includes a grab bag of funds for space programs, including $10 billion for Mars mission priorities, $325 million to held de-orbit the International Space Station and $85 million to take the space shuttle from the National Air and Space Museum in the Virginia suburbs of Washington and transport it to Texas.",
      "Projected cost: $10 billion for Mars, $325 million for space station de-orbiting and $85 million for the space shuttle move.",
      "Private college endowment tax",
      "What it would do: The legislation would establish a new excise tax on investment income from endowments for colleges with more than 3,000 students: 8% for the wealthiest colleges and 4% and 1.4% for colleges with smaller endowments.",
      "Projected savings: $761 million.",
      "Defunding Planned Parenthood",
      "What it would do: The legislation would cut off Medicaid funding for entities that provide abortions (except in rare cases like rape and incest), seeking to fulfill a long-standing conservative goal of defunding Planned Parenthood.",
      "Projected cost: $52 million.",
      "Debt ceiling hike",
      "The package includes a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling, which is more than the $4 trillion in the House-passed package."

      "A Los Angeles man who was in a law enforcement-like vehicle and detained said he\u2019s being used as a \u201cscapegoat\u201d amid fears over immigration enforcement.",
      "On Friday afternoon, the mayor and police chief of Huntington Park said police who came across a gray Dodge Durango on Tuesday night initially believed it may have been a federal law enforcement vehicle because inside were red-and-blue police-style visor lights and multiple handheld radios of the type used by law enforcement.",
      "The officers took a closer look and discovered the vehicle had a magazine for a gun in plain sight, Police Chief Cosme Lozano said at a news conference Friday afternoon. Fernando Diaz, 23, was initially arrested based on a bench warrant for an allegation of drunk driving from May 11, but he was ultimately booked that night and accused of carrying and concealing a firearm in his vehicle, according to court records.",
      "In a statement Saturday, the city said what appeared to be federal immigration documents, as well as personal records of unknown people, were also in the vehicle.",
      "\u201cThis evidence is in addition to statements made by Mr. Diaz himself, claiming to be a former employee of Customs and Border Protection,\u201d it said.",
      "Diaz has not been charged with impersonating a federal agent, but the city said in a statement that the police department sent a case to the district attorney for possible charges. In an interview, he said he has never claimed to be a federal agent and is instead being punished for the bad actions of others.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want to go to Washington and talk to the president directly about the issues that are going on over here,\u201d Diaz said, referring to \u201cpoliticians.\u201d \u201cThey want to use me as their scapegoat so they can get the attention of Washington or whoever they want to get the attention to.\u201d",
      "Diaz was arrested amid the backdrop of mass immigration raids that have struck fear among communities across the country.",
      "Hours of social media videos of raids, verified by NBC News, show agents who lack name tags, badges and badge numbers issuing orders to people at restaurants, Home Depot locations and car washes.",
      "The agents, usually working under the Department of Homeland Security and its Immigration and Customs Enforcement arm, often use face coverings and unmarked vehicles.",
      "Agents also often refuse to give their names or badge numbers, raising the ire of civil libertarians and immigrant rights\u2019 groups who argue that without clear identities the agents may lack authority and invite resistance.",
      "In March, California Attorney General Rob Bonta warned that criminals posing as federal agents were trying to capitalize \u201con the fear and uncertainty\u201d of the immigration crackdown promised by President Donald Trump.",
      "In mid-June, state Sens. Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin, both Democrats, introduced the No Secret Police Act, which would ban law enforcement officers from covering their faces and operating without clear name tags or badge information.",
      "Other officials, from Gov. Gavin Newsom to local mayors like Huntington Park\u2019s Arturo Flores, have also clashed with the Trump administration over the deployment of troops and cloaked federal agents for mass deportations in the state.",
      "\u201cWho are these people?\u201d Flores said, quoting a resident concerned about federal agents. \u201cAre they bounty hunters? Are they vigilantes? These questions reflect the breakdown of trust. When ICE and other federal agencies choose to operate in secret, with no transparency, they don\u2019t just enforce the law; they incite fear.\u201d",
      "Diaz\u2019s arrest inspired the Huntington Park City Council to pass a resolution directing its police department to \u201cverify\u201d anyone claiming to be a federal immigration agent. The city of roughly 52,000 is nearly 97% Latino.",
      "The city said Friday night it was postponing certain summer events for 30 days as a result of ICE raids in the region and \u201cwidespread anxiety\u201d caused by authorities using unmarked vehicles and masking their identities.",
      "Flores on Friday invited Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to meet and discuss why he believes her agents need to identify themselves.",
      "The agency did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Homeland Security spokespeople have said agents need to hide their identities because their information, including their home addresses, will otherwise be \u201cdoxxed,\u201d or made public, by criminals.",
      "The tension between local officials and federal immigration authorities, Diaz said, has made him feel like a \u201cguinea pig.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m their scapegoat because they need somebody to blame,\u201d he said.",
      "Court records show Diaz was released without bail on the gun allegations and told to perform community service as part of a diversion program that would erase the case if he stays out of trouble. The drunk driving case was not heard; a hearing is scheduled for Aug. 11.",
      "Diaz indicated there was no mention of or concern about claims of impersonating an officer when he was in court on the gun charges."

      "The otherworldly dessert (first offered from June 23 until June 28) is inspired by a lyric from his April single \u201cMystical Magical\u201d and will again be at all Crumbl locations from Monday, June 30 until Saturday, July 5.",
      "\u201cMoonbeam ice cream, taking off your blue jeans,\u201d he sings on the Billboard Hot 100 hit off his sophomore album, \u201cAmerican Heart\u201d which dropped June 20. (In case you\u2019re wondering about the lyric\u2019s meaning \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have one.)",
      "Crumbl says Boone\u2019s chilled chocolate cookie channels the same \u201cmood and magic as its musical muse\u201d and features cookies and cream pieces, a psychedelically colored lemon, berry and marshmallow topping, a drizzle of white icing, and cookies and cream sprinkle.",
      "\u201cTurns out one week just wasn\u2019t enough for the cookie that had fans seeing stars,\u201d Crumbl writes in a press release, and Crumbl CEO and co-founder Jason McGowan adds that fans asked for the cookie to come back, so the company decided to be \u201chere for it \u2014 with backflips!\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve never done an encore before, but when a cookie creates this kind of buzz, we knew we had to bring it back,\u201d McGowan says.",
      "Fans on social media are indeed excited for the cookie\u2019s return, with one writing, \u201cSo happy moonbeam ice cream cookie is back.\u201d",
      "Sawyer Hemsley, Crumbl\u2019s chief brand officer, co-founder and noted backflipper himself, says Boone was very hands-on in crafting the cookie flavor, noting his \u201ccreativity, passion, and musical energy\u201d made for a fun collaboration.",
      "\u201cWe took the way his song makes you feel and turned it into something you can taste,\u201d said Hemsley in a press release.",
      "Boone has crafted a reputation for his falsetto voice, jumpsuits with deep V-necks, backflips and what some find to be annoying behavior.",
      "And that\u2019s not an insult \u2014 just a fact \u2014 as there are think pieces and Reddit threads exploring why he seems to push people\u2019s buttons. The singer is fully aware of this facet of his career, noting in a TikTok earlier this year that if people are going to \u201chate me or my music at least have a good reason for it.\u201d",
      "He even poked fun at the haters in his most recent music video for the track \u201cMr. Electric Blue.\u201d In it, he repeatedly backflips on a trampoline, wears a T-shirt that reads \u201cone hit wonder,\u201d sells discount jumpsuits and says being the \u201cmost overplayed artist in the world\u201d is \u201call (he\u2019s) ever wanted.\u201d",
      "A little girl also tells him his \u201cmusic is terrible\u201d as he serves her ice cream, so you have to at least give him points for self-deprecation."

      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian spent more than two hours walking the jurors through the five criminal counts at the heart of the case, detailing the charges and instructing the panel on the finer points of federal law.

    "story": [
      "More than 14 million people could die over the next five years because of the Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to an analysis published Monday in the medical journal The Lancet.",
      "Researchers calculated the lifesaving benefits of USAID funding over a 21-year period, then used the data to determine how many lives would be lost without USAID funding in the future.",
      "The analysis found that, from 2001 through 2021, USAID-funded programs prevented nearly 92 million deaths across 133 countries, including more than 25 million deaths from HIV/AIDS, around 11 million from diarrheal diseases, 8 million from malaria and nearly 5 million from tuberculosis.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in March that he was canceling 83% of USAID\u2019s programs, which he said did not serve \u201cthe core national interests of the United States,\u201d and added that the State Department would absorb the roughly 1,000 remaining programs.",
      "The action brought many overseas humanitarian efforts to a grinding halt, leading to the closings of food kitchens and health clinics in underserved countries and in some cases delaying or stopping the distribution of lifesaving medications, bed nets to ward off malaria, nutritional packets for starving children and chlorine tablets to disinfect dirty water.",
      "The analysis, done by a team of international researchers from Spain, Brazil, Mozambique and the United States, estimated the impact of the 83% funding cuts, assuming they remain through 2030. Of the more than 14 million deaths forecast, around 4.5 million would be among children under 5, the authors found.",
      "\u201cThe numbers are striking, but we are not the only group that did this kind of analysis,\u201d said Davide Rasella, a research professor at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, who coordinated the study. Other research groups, he said, \u201ccame up with similar magnitudes \u2014 millions and millions of deaths that will be caused by the defunding of USAID.\u201d",
      "A model from a Boston University researcher estimated that funding cuts for U.S. aid and support organizations are leading to 88 deaths per hour.",
      "Before it was gutted, USAID was a key partner in overseas efforts to alleviate poverty and disease. It also supported the economic growth of low- and middle-income countries with the capacity to trade with the United States. The agency managed more than $35 billion last year, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Rubio said in March that the agency\u2019s \u201cgains were too few and the costs were too high,\u201d though he promised to keep \u201cessential lifesaving programs.\u201d A lawsuit filed in February on behalf of government workers and foreign service employees is challenging the funding cuts in court, but the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "A New York Times investigation found that, as of May 7, more than half of the remaining USAID programs were dedicated to crisis relief \u2014 assistance for people affected by disasters and conflicts. Some malaria, tuberculosis and HIV programs remain, as well.",
      "Amira Albert Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University, said the way the funding was terminated is partly responsible for the high number of predicted deaths.",
      "\u201cFor better or for worse, some of the USAID-funded clinics in some areas, they were the main source of care,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you wanted to reduce USAID funding, it could have been done in a more gradual manner, instead of this sudden \u2014 and really, in a lot of places, overnight \u2014 shuttering of clinics.\u201d",
      "The abrupt closings of HIV clinics, for instance, meant some people could not refill their medications, which can be life-threatening.",
      "\u201cIf you miss a dose or multiple doses, as was the case with lots of individuals, that\u2019s creating a situation where the individual can start to deteriorate fairly rapidly,\u201d Roess said.",
      "Rasella said the funding cuts are also having a ripple effect in European countries, which have similarly slashed their humanitarian aid budgets. \u201cWe are in a crisis now,\u201d he said.",
      "The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said this month that it is seeing \u201cthe deepest funding cuts ever to hit the international humanitarian sector.\u201d"

      "The 940-page legislation, which the Senate advanced on a 51-49 vote late Saturday, was still taking shape even as the \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d began \u2014 a process in which senators can offer an unlimited number of amendments \u2014 with GOP leaders hoping to use it to satisfy concerns from wavering factions.",
      "The math: Republicans need to hold 50 of their 53 senators to pass the bill. They have lost Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who complained that it adds too much to the national debt, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who blasted the Medicaid cuts as damaging to his home state. (More on Tillis below.)",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, voted to advance the bill on Saturday but told NBC News she was still leaning against it on final passage. She expressed worries about the Medicaid cuts and said she prefers raising taxes on high earners, calling those \u201ctwo of the most important things\u201d she wants addressed.",
      "And Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who also voted to keep the process moving over the weekend after discussions with Republican leaders, has voiced Medicaid concerns.",

      "The cost: The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that the Senate bill would increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion over the next 10 years \u2014 it found that revenues would fall by about $4.5 trillion and spending would be cut by $1.2 trillion. The bill is also projected to lead to 11.8 million people losing their health insurance by 2034 if it becomes law, the CBO said.",
      "The GOP is using a budget trick known as \u201ccurrent policy baseline\u201c to hide the cost of extending the tax cuts Trump signed into law in 2017, effectively lowering the sticker price by $3.8 trillion. That tactic has not been used in the budget process before and would set a precedent to weaken the Senate\u2019s 60-vote rule.

Millions tuned in to Netflix on Christmas Day for a livestream of NFL games, as well as a halftime show concert headlined by Beyonc\u00e9. Even though it was plagued by reports of problems with the video quality, a boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul streamed on Netflix in November was viewed in 60 million households.

      "NASA+, which launched in 2023 as a way for the public to get easier access to space content, is already free on NASA\u2019s app and NASA.gov. But the space agency is hoping that it can tap in some of Netflix's 700 million+ subscribers and generate even more interest in space exploration.",

    "summary": "The lawsuit accused Selzer of fraud after she conducted a 2024 poll before that showed Kamala Harris leading Trump in Iowa. He ended up winning the state.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Monday dropped his federal lawsuit against Iowa pollster Ann Selzer and The Des Moines Register over a poll that found Democratic nominee Kamala Harris leading in Iowa shortly before Election Day in November.",
      "Hours later, Trump\u2019s attorneys refiled the lawsuit in state court.",
      "Trump's lawyers provided no explanation in the federal filing in Polk County. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A federal judge denied Trump's request to move the case to a state venue this month.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit civil liberties group that is representing Selzer, said in a statement that Trump's effort to dismiss the federal case after having lost his earlier attempt to remand it to state court \"is a transparent attempt to avoid federal court review of the president\u2019s transparently frivolous claims.\"",
      "\"Whatever court ultimately reviews this matter, FIRE will defend J. Ann Selzer\u2019s First Amendment rights, and we remain confident the courts will see through this sham lawsuit,\" Corn-Revere said.",
      "Lark-Marie Anton, a spokesperson for the Register, said in a statement that Trump's move to drop the case in U.S. district court was \"clearly intended to avoid the inevitable outcome of the Des Moines Register\u2019s motion to dismiss President Trump\u2019s amended complaint currently pending in federal court.\"",
      "\u201cAfter losing his first attempt to send his case back to Iowa state court, and apparently recognizing that his appeal will be unsuccessful, President Trump is attempting to unilaterally dismiss his lawsuit from federal court and re-file it in Iowa state court,\" Anton said before Trump refiled his lawsuit. \"The Des Moines Register will continue to resist President Trump\u2019s litigation gamesmanship and believes that regardless of the forum it will be successful in defending its rights under the First Amendment.\u201d",
      "The newspaper previously said Trump's federal lawsuit was \u201cwithout merit\u201d and acknowledged that the Selzer/Des Moines Register pre-election poll \u201cdid not reflect the ultimate margin of President Trump\u2019s Election Day victory in Iowa.\u201d",
      "Trump in December sued Selzer; her polling firm, Selzer & Co.; The Des Moines Register; and the newspaper\u2019s parent company, Gannett, alleging consumer fraud over the poll, which found Harris up by 3 percentage points in the state. Trump defeated her in Iowa 55.7% to 42.5% last year.",
      "Trump has carried the state in the past three presidential contests, beating Hillary Clinton 51.7% to 42.2% in 2016 and besting Joe Biden 53.1% to 44.9% in 2020.",
      "Trump's lawsuit against Selzer and the Register was one of many he filed over 2024 campaign coverage.",
      "He filed a similar suit against Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, in which he accused \u201c60 Minutes\u201d of selectively editing an interview segment with Harris ahead of the election.",
      "In a filing Monday, attorneys for Trump and Paramount asked the court for a pause in the proceedings for the $20 billion lawsuit, saying the parties \u201care engaged in good faith, advanced, settlement negotiations.\u201d"

      "People living and working in Haiti are questioning the Trump administration\u2019s reasoning that it is safe enough for Haitians temporarily living in the U.S. to return to their embattled country of origin.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security announced Friday that it will end Temporary Protective Status (TPS) for Haitian people living in the United States legally.",
      "\u201cHow can DHS send 500,000 Haitians back to a country that is the most dangerous country in the world?\u201d Len Gengel, who runs a nonprofit organization in Haiti that helps orphaned children, told NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s a war zone.\u201d",
      "DHS Secretary Kristi Noem\u2019s announcement was the latest effort by President Donald Trump and his administration to accelerate deportations for Haitian immigrants living in the country. The TPS program was created in 1990 to provide people in disaster-stricken countries to find legal, short-term refuge in the United States. Its abrupt end means deportation for immigrants of 17 other countries, too, including Sudan, Lebanon and Afghanistan. Haitians are expecte to leave by September 2",
      "More than 1,800 people were kidnapped and 8,200 killed in Haiti since gang violence escalated in March of last year; a record 1.3 million people are currently homeless, according to the United Nations.",
      "Armed gangs seized control over much of the capital, Port-au-Prince, after the assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse on July 7, 2021.. Since Mo\u00efse\u2019s assasination, the country has been in relentless turmoil, with no discernable government, as it endures extreme violence, hunger and homelessness.",
      "According to a recent report from the International Organization for Migration, there has been a 24% increase in displaced people in the last six months, with 11% of Haiti\u2019s nearly 12 million residents chased out of their homes by gunmen.",
      "In fact, the State Department\u2019s 2024 advisory for Haiti remains in effect, warning Americans not to travel to the country due to \u201ckidnapping, crime, civil unrest and limited health care.\u201d",
      "Still, the Trump administration expects Haitians to return to their home country in about two months.",
      "\u201cThe environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home,\u201d a DHS spokesperson said in a statement last week. There was no mention of how conditions have improved. NBC News\u2019 request for additional comment went unanswered.",
      "In a news conference Monday,North Miami councilwoman Mary Estim\u00e9-Irvin called the decision was \u201coutright unjust.\u201d. She pointed out that the announcement came days after the U.S. Embassy in Haiti warned Americans to vacate the country immediately due to violence and instability.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, Haiti is in a crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cGang-ruled streets once filled with hope. Schools are shattered, hospitals overwhelmed, families displaced. To say Haiti is safe to return defies facts, reason and morality.\u201d",
      "As someone coming in and out of Haiti for 15 years, Gengel said conditions have not improved. \u201cSeeing this country fall apart is so devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are dying of starvation after years of this gang war.\u201d",
      "Gengel and his nonprofit, Be Like Brit Foundation, began his work in Haiti assisting orphans to honor the wishes of his daughter, Britney, who died there at age 19 while providing aid during the devastating earthquake of 2010. The troubles on the island have only gotten worse, leading 500,000 Haitians to seek asylum status in the U.S. in the last 15 years.",
      "Gengel began working in the country soon after his daughter\u2019s death, after closing his business in Massachusetts to fulfill Britney\u2019s wish.",
      "To keep the children in his orphanage safe, Gengel said he had to learn how to shoot a firearm and has purchased guns to support the hired security at the Port-au-Prince facility.",
      "\u201cI never shot a gun until I was 60 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to learn to shoot and get a gun license. It\u2019s like we are in prison.\u201d",
      "One of the children Gengel helped in Haiti came to the U.S. under President Biden\u2019s administration and obtained temporary protected status. He now works as a bookkeeper but \u201cthey won\u2019t renew his work permit,\u201d Gengel said. \u201cHe may have to return to Haiti this summer.\u201d",
      "Some have compared Trump\u2019s cancellation of the TPS program as a \u201cdeath sentence.\u201d",
      "\u201cDeporting people back to these conditions is a death sentence for many, stripping them of their fundamental right to safety and dignity,\u201d said Tessa Pettit, a Haitian American who is executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, to The Associated Press.",
      "For three years, Frantz Desir, 36, has been an asylee in the U.S. Now he fears he could be next sent back, he told the AP.",
      "\u201cYou see your friends who used to go to work every day, and suddenly \u2014 without being sick or fired \u2014 they just can\u2019t go anymore,\u201d he said, referring to the extreme current conditions in Haiti. \u201cIt hits you. Even if it hasn\u2019t happened to you yet, you start to worry, \u2018What if it\u2019s me next?\u2019\u201d",
      "TPS, designed to protect people from troubled countries who fear for their safety, is not a free pass to America, Abigail Desravines told NBC News this year. She came to the U.S. after the earthquake. \u201cYou have to keep renewing, pay fees and live with the fear that it could end at any time,\u201d Desravines said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy path.\u201d"

    "summary": "Broadway actress Jennie Harney-Fleming was singing an encore when her daughter screamed, \"I want to go home.\" The video of what happened next went viral.",
    "story": [
      "Broadway actress Jennie Harney-Fleming had just starting singing the encore at her solo concert in the New York City area when she heard a little voice yell: \"I want to go home!\"",
      "The heckler was none other than Harney-Fleming's 3-year-old daughter Olivia, who was up past her bedtime.",
      "Without missing a beat, Harney-Fleming said, \"Come here, baby. Come here, Olivia. Come to Mommy. It's too loud, I know.\"",
      "Wearing a fitted sequin dress and heels, Harney-Fleming picked Olivia up, returned to the mic and restarted the classic song \"Feeling Good.\" The video of Fleming singing the entire song while holding her daughter with one arm has garnered more than 2.7 million views on Instagram in 10 days ... plus the attention of celebrities.",
      "But in the moment, Olivia only wanted attention from one person: her mom.",
      "\"When I came back and started singing the second song, my daughter was like, 'Girl, we got to wrap this up!'\" Harney-Fleming tells TODAY.com.",
      "The concert began at 8pm and it was only an hour long, but that was way past bedtime for Olivia and her 5-year-old sister Ella. \"They did very well sitting through that show,\" Harney-Flemming shares. \"But I think my little one just reached her breaking point.\"",
      "The actress has grown used to changing plans on a dime. After all, before she played Angelica Schuyler in the Broadway company of \"Hamilton,\" she became the \"universal swing\" for the Schuyler sisters on tour in 2017. That meant that if any one of the actresses playing Angelica, Eliza or Peggy were sick in any production across the country, she would grab her suitcase of costumes, hop on a plane and perform on stage that evening.",
      "So when she heard Olivia complaining, Harney-Fleming says she  \"didn't give it a second thought. I think if we tried to deal with it any other way, she might have had a meltdown and caused a scene. I just knew what needed to be done and told her she was safe to come stay with me while I finish up the show.\"",
      "Another familiar face was on stage that evening: Olivia's father, DeWitt Fleming Jr., who was playing the drums.",
      "The actors first met \u2014 where else? \u2014 while starring in an off-Broadway show. And in late 2024, the couple enjoyed a musical dream: performing in principal roles in Broadway's \"A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical.\" Ella and Olivia spent every Saturday hanging out with their mom and dad backstage at the theater.",
      "\"It was important for them to see Mommy and Daddy on stage,\" Harney-Fleming says. \"We feel that it's very important to keep our children in the loop of what it means when we say we're going to work.\"",
      "Theater is in the girls' blood: Harney-Fleming's father received the Tony Award for his role as Curtis Taylor, Jr. in the original production of \"Dreamgirls.\"",
      "\"He went on to have a really wonderful career, but ultimately made the decision to leave the industry, both for ministry as well as for his family,\" says Harney-Flemming. \"That really left an indelible mark on me in terms of how I move through the industry now, and how we prioritize our time and our relationships in these professional spaces.\"",
      "Many notable performers expressed support for Harney-Fleming's viral video.",
      "The original Angelica Schuyler (and fellow Broadway mom) Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry wrote, \"Thank you for the master class!\"",
      "Natasha Bedingfield commented, \"I love this so much. \u2764\ufe0f Incredible mom and incredible singing.\"",
      "Holly Robinson Peete added, \"I needed this today,\" and Amy Schumer reposted the video.",
      "Questlove commented, \"I did this to my dad at MSG once in 1973 \u2026 Did not end like this lol.\"",
      "Harney-Fleming says she feels incredibly grateful for the support, and to answer the question everyone seemed to be asking: she's not sure how she sang a song with such incredible breath control while holding her daughter in one arm.",
      "\"Sometimes as a mom, you look back on your day and you're like, 'How the heck did I get all those things done?'\" she says. \"You rise to the occasion, and you don't give the workload a second thought. You just do it because it needs to be done.\""

    "story": [
      "The final episodes of Netflix\u2019s \"Squid Game\" Season 3 push the dystopian series into darker moral territory, with one of its most emotional arcs centered on Player 222, a pregnant woman forced to fight for her life and that of her unborn child.",
      "Player 222, Kim Jun-hee (played by Jo Yu-ri), is introduced as a quiet but resilient contestant.",
      "Viewers soon learn she was lured into the game after being conned by her ex-boyfriend, Player 333, Lee Myung-gi (Im Si-wan), who tricked her into investing in a cryptocurrency scam that leaves her in debt.",
      "Here's what to know about her fate, and her child's.",
      "What happens to Player 222 in the games?",
      "In a pivotal hide-and-seek challenge, Jun-hee breaks her ankle and goes into labor.",
      "With help from Player 149, Jang Geum-ja (Kang Ae-shim), a former nurse, and Player 120, Cho Hyun-ju (Park Sung-hoon), the show\u2019s first transgender character, she gives birth while hiding from guards and other competitors.",

      "Lee Jung-Jae clarified to Variety that a robotic doll was used.",
      "\u201cThe robot had actual facial expressions. It would wiggle like a newborn baby, and the weight was quite realistic. So that helped me a lot with my performance,\u201d Lee said."

    "summary": "Katie Sturino opens up about writing her first novel and her role in the body positivity space.",
    "story": [
      "Katie Sturino opens her first novel with a scene that many of her readers will likely find uncomfortably familiar: Trying on a bathing suit in a well-lit dressing room and not liking what you see in the mirror.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a universal thing,\u201d Sturino tells TODAY.com. \u201cWho has not been able to find something in a store, and then left feeling like you triggered an eating disorder?\u201d",
      "The book's protagonist, Sunny, grapples with the feeling of being big in a world that wants her to be smaller. Sturino herself can relate.",
      "Her debut novel fits into the mission she\u2019s carved as a truth-teller speaking up around expectations of women\u2019s bodies as a multi-hyphenate entrepreneur, blogger and voice in the body positivity space.",
      "The book character Sunny shares obvious similarities with Sturino too. Sunny runs a PR company; Sturino ran a PR company for years. Sunny is getting over a divorce from an influencer; Sturino divorced Josh Ostrovsky, known as The Fat Jewish online, in 2017. Sunny loves her rescue dogs; Sturino\u2019s dogs had their own viral accounts. Sunny starts a business (swimsuits); Sturino started a business (personal care brand Megababe).",
      "\u201cThere are certainly a lot of things that are taken from my life,\u201d Sturino says, noting that the book's individuals are fictional \u2014 for the most part. She did base one of Sunny\u2019s suitors directly on her now-husband, John Forkin. \u201cI learned what good, healthy love looks like from him and I wanted to show that to people,\u201d she says.",
      "The character overlap is entirely on purpose: This is the book Sturino says she wanted after her divorce in 2017. \u201cThis book offers an alternative narrative to the typical breakup story, which is like, girl gets dumped, then, like gets a glow up and finds she\u2019s worthy of love,\u201d she says.",
      "The book defies typical narratives. Instead of a \u201crevenge body,\u201d for example, Sunny gains weight, just like Sturino did after her divorce. Sturino avoided the revenge-body trope on purpose. \u201cIt reinforces the idea that there is only one way to find to be worthy of love, and that is to be at your smallest, most fit body,\u201d she says.",
      "Sunny gets the guy and her happily ever after without trying to change who she is or how she looks. Still, Sunny's relationship with her body impacts every part of the plot. It\u2019s the inspiration for Sunny\u2019s swimsuit brand. It comes up when she\u2019s dating. It\u2019s in the haunting remarks of her ex. And yet she expresses frustration about it \u2014 she\u2019s tired of having to talk about her body.",
      "The press tour for \u201cSunny Side Up\u201d has often pointed to Sturino\u2019s own body and journey. Amid the interviews, Sturino opened up about using a type of weight-loss medication called a GLP-1 agonist to lower her A1C (a measure of blood sugar levels) after trying other interventions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that so often women are not allowed to just talk about their work without including the body narrative,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd by body, I really mean weight. I just don\u2019t think that we talk about men that way in the media, and it\u2019s pretty consistent that we talk about women like that.\u201d",
      "Sturino says she starting taking a GLP-1 agonist for her health and now is approached by people asking if they have to get on it, too. \u201cI\u2019m like, 'No, you don\u2019t have to get on this.' That\u2019s the downside of having the conversation everywhere \u2014 there is a pressure,\u201d she says.",
      "Ultimately, she's happy to be transparent. \u201cI hope that sharing my story helps someone too. And based on the comments I\u2019ve gotten recently, I think it has,\u201d she says.",
      "Sunny, by the end of the book, comes to a conclusion that her body wasn\u2019t the problem. If there\u2019s anything Sturino wants her followers to know from her work, it\u2019s just that.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the main messaging on my channel. You can lose weight, gain weight, have a baby, aging, all these different ways our body changes over our life. You have to do the work in your brain to accept your body, because your body will change throughout your life. If you don\u2019t do that work, then every single change is a jump scare,\u201d she says.",
      "She calls her book an \u201canchor\u201d in a new landscape where skinny seems to be en vogue again, no thanks recent social media trends and speculation about which celebrities are taking Ozempic and why.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really hard time. But it doesn\u2019t mean that we just throw the last 10 years down the drain and just say, well, we\u2019re back here. I think if you want to keep the fight up, you can, and you should.\u201d",
      "There are days it seems the body positivity movement \u2014 which promoted accepting bodies of all sizes \u2014 is, well, over. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be,\u201d she says. \u201cWe choose what\u2019s important.\"",
      "Because, Sturino says, this isn\u2019t a \u201cone size issue\u201d \u2014 \u201call women, for the most part, have poor body image, because we\u2019ve been trained to,\u201d she says.",
      "Sunny\u2019s story is inspired by Sturino\u2019s life and inevitably, body image plays into both. But in Sturino\u2019s ideal world, maybe there wouldn\u2019t be a need for these conversations.",
      "\u201cIf we could just get women focusing on their power and not their size, I think that we could really talk about what\u2019s important and ways to harness our power \u2014 versus how do we all get as collectively small as possible?\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a scam,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all falling for it.\u201d"

While films depicting queer love were not formally banned, the Hays Code, also known as the Motion Picture Production Code, had Hollywood studios self-enforce a set of guidelines from around 1934 to 1968 to prevent government interference. Centered around \"moral standards\" and social values, the guidelines purported to ensure movies presented viewers with \"correct standards of life\" by banning profanity, obscenity and graphic violence. It also prevented overt or positive portrayals of LGBTQ+ relationships, according to a library guide from Ithaca College.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until the 1960s that the Hays Code was effectively challenged. The organization now known as the Motion Picture Association (MPA) established a film content rating system in 1968 which served as the code\u2019s replacement.",
      "Though it\u2019s been over 50 years since the Hays Code, and much progress has been made for LGBTQ+ representation in cinema, there still remain ongoing challenges for accurate and authentic narratives. The queer community continues to navigate a fickle film industry that periodically offers room for diverse storytelling, but can miss the mark with film tropes like the \u201cgay best friend,\u201d the \u201ccloseted bully\" or \"bury your gays,\" referring to a pattern of queer characters being killed off in shows and movies.",
      "Carlos King, CEO of Kingdom Reign Entertainment and a TV industry creative, tells TODAY.com that it\u2019s important to have authentic queer stories on screen so viewers can move past stereotypes and caricatures.",
      "\u201cI want to see (movies) starring queer people, not as being the sidekick to the main cast member or being the glam squad that we just see on television,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are leading. We have leading roles in our personal lives. We are executives. We\u2019re a vice president, presidents, CEOs of multiple companies.\u201d",
      "King says he strives to bring the representation \u2014 including that of love in the LGBTQ+ community \u2014\u00a0that he didn't have growing up to the screen.",
      "\u201cBeing a young gay Black boy from Detroit, Michigan, one of 10 siblings, I know all about desiring to look at a television screen and wanting to see someone like you reflected back,\" he says.",
      "Filmmaker Elegance Bratton, whose 2022 autobiographical breakout military drama, \u201cThe Inspection,\u201d received rave reviews from critics, tells TODAY.com that showing queer romance on screen helps to combat the negativity often felt in society.",
      "\u201cShowing love is always a good thing. We live in a world where hatred of queer people is reaching a fever point,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe need to see queer people loving on each other because it\u2019s real. We do love and that spirit is indomitable.\u201d",
      "Andrea Ambam, director of programming at Level Forward, a public benefit entertainment company, agrees, telling TODAY.com that seeing these stories on the big screen can help members of the LGBTQ+ community feel seen.",
      "\u201cI know and believe that queer films are important because of the way they\u2019re able to reach us through the screen,\u201d she says. \u201cThe way they\u2019re able to find, often, young people who may or may not be questioning their belonging in their homes, in their schools, in their communities, and they reach across the screen and say, \u2018You belong. You are here. There are more people like you.\u2019\u201d"

      "What began as a regulation exercise from her therapist has turned Balka into a viral sensation in late 20223, with the likes of John Mayer, Jennifer Aniston and Mel Robbins sharing her work. And now, with the release of her first book, \"I Hope You Remember,\" Balka can add New York Times bestselling author to her list of accolades. (Her second book, \"Loves of Our Lives,\" will be out January 2026.)",

But usually with poems, it\u2019s pretty positive. Anybody who\u2019s being mean on the internet, I would never admire those people, so I find that I can\u2019t be scared of them either.",
      "I had one go super viral at the end of 2023, the public pool one. And that was kind of the first one that I was like, \u201cWoah, what just happened?\u201d I think as kind of unfortunate as it is, one of the main ways that I want to push forward is when people are encouraging me to do so, and sometimes it does take a little bit of enforcement. And being encouraged by celebrities that I\u2019ve looked up to for a long time, I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. This could be something.\u201d",
      "I believe that I had just gone shopping or was looking at bathing",

      "Josie balka",
      "suits online and I was just thinking about how crappy of an experience that always is for me. And I just have never, ever put any significance into why I love somebody based on their body. I kind of was like, \u201cWhy are you so worried that everyone's looking at you when you\u2019ve never looked at anybody else and remembered them?\u201d",
      "It kind of spiraled into all these other reasons that describe why people care about who you are and not how you look, and different scenarios in your life. I feel like it\u2019s a really important thing to remember.",
      "I lost over 100 pounds, and I have lots of trauma from it. I\u2019ve had a few surgeries for loose skin and that kind of stuff. After my first plastic surgery for my lower body, I got sepsis and almost died. It's crazy that I did this for how I looked, and then I almost died. And it didn\u2019t make me any happier. It just made me feel smaller, and I kind of thought that was the only thing I needed or wanted.",
      "And then there was kind of a big realization when I got to my goal. I still had all these things to work through and my happiness was never really dependent on the way that I looked in the way that I thought. I think there\u2019s a lot of people who sit around saying, \u201cWell, if I just lost 10 pounds \u2026 if I didn\u2019t have this loose skin, my life would be so much better.\u201d But there\u2019s no end goal, you just find something else. The way you look will never be the only thing. And I feel like I\u2019ve learned that firsthand a lot over the last few years.",
      "Some of the most resonating things I find are the things that I\u2019m sitting here thinking I\u2019m the only one who feels that way, because I truly don\u2019t think there are many unique experiences. Often if you just say the one thing that you carry the most shame over out loud, you\u2019ll find 100 other people that feel that way too. That\u2019s kind of why I leaned into it.",
      "It goes both ways.  Every time somebody goes, \"Oh, I really related to this thing, it made me feel less alone,\" I get to be like, \"Oh, because you related to this, now I know that I\u2019m not alone in that thought.\" I hope that other people scrolling through the comment section of a video they resonate with are seeing 100 other people that are like, \"Me too, me too, me too.\" And we can make everyone feel less alone together.",
      "I would have to have more of a routine with it. I usually just write down ideas as they come to me. I'll think of a line while I\u2019m driving or at work and I\u2019ll just type it into my phone. Eventually I\u2019ll scroll through all the one-liners on my notes app and expand on one of them. And if I feel like it\u2019s good enough, I\u2019ll go downstairs in my studio and record and post it. I\u2019d say 99% of the time, I write, record and post all in the same night.",
      "He was not wanting to do vows in front of people. He is very loving and very sweet and he\u2019s not shy to tell me how he feels but he is definitely shy to speak in front of a crowd. Originally he was like, \u201cCan we please just do private vows?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNope, I want to do them in front of everybody.\u201d So we are going to do them.",
      "I honestly don\u2019t think they will be that crazy or that amazing. They\u2019ll be pretty personalized, it\u2019ll probably be the way I would talk to him on a normal day.",
      "I think that\u2019s kind of the scary thing about success: It never feels like enough. Like everything after, if it\u2019s not quite up to par, you always feel like you didn\u2019t do as good a job, you know? Obviously in my head, I hope for success moving forward. But I also just hope to keep enjoying it. I love doing it, it\u2019s my total passion. It\u2019s my journal entries come to life. It\u2019s what my therapist told me to do to get regulated. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful that it\u2019s turned into something like this, and I just hope that I continue to love that and I continue to be able to connect with people.",
      "I remember saying to my therapist once at the beginning, \"What if I can\u2019t continue it? What if I can\u2019t maintain it?\" And she was like, \"Nobody can ever take away what\u2019s already happened.\" So I think that I get to move forward knowing that what\u2019s already happened is mine. Obviously I hope for more of it, but even if all I got was what I have, I would be so happy to have it."

      "Charlie or Pepe? Where Hannah\u2019s Heart Lies",
      "The end of Hannah\u2019s journey on \u201cLove Island USA\u201d was a choice made by her fellow islanders. During Sunday\u2019s episode, the islanders were informed that America had been voting on their favorite guys and girls, as individuals. When the bottom three guys and bottom the girls were revealed, the rest of the villa had to choose two people \u2014 a guy and a girl \u2014 to dump. The girls eliminated Hannah, and the guys nixed Jeremiah.",
      "To many viewers, the islanders\u2019 selections were shocking moves. Jeremiah had been coming out of his shell after finding resolution in his hectic breakup with Huda. As for Hannah, she had just witnessed her first connection, Charlie, exit the villa in the same way and was finding a bit of happiness with a new guy, Pepe.",
      "Following her elimination, a pressing question remained: Does Hannah\u2019s heart lie with Pepe ... or with Charlie?",
      "\u201cMy heart is waiting for Pepe to get out of that villa,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cI\u2019ve just been waiting and waiting to see if that\u2019s going to go anywhere. We had a really good talk before I left, and I\u2019ve just really been missing him.",

      "For now, she\u2019s acknowledges that the \u201creal world\u201d is much different than the villa, where around-the-clock proximity plays a big role.",
      "She adds, \u201cI think it\u2019s a waiting game to see where everything lies out and what really aligns for us, and see if we really work outside of the villa.\u201d",
      "Did Hannah Hope Pepe Would Leave With Her?",
      "Feelings are always heightened immediately following dumpings, and Hannah\u2019s was no exception. Was there any part of Hannah that thought Pepe might feel strongly enough to leave with her?",
      "\u201cHe had kind of mentioned it, but I just don\u2019t really think that it was an option,\u201d Hannah says. \u201cEven when Charlie left, I had thought about leaving. I think I had told Iris, \u2018I think I\u2019m going to go,\u2019 but I just don\u2019t think it was an actual option to leave. I don\u2019t really know exactly. Maybe it is.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think our sisterhood is really, really strong,\u201d Hanna tells TODAY.com. \u201cI think obviously there were moments where we\u2019d have little, you know, back-and-forth arguments \u2014 but honestly not really. There were only a couple notable ones and we really bounced back super fast from that.\u201d",
      "She mentions Huda, who had pursued Pepe briefly without being upfront with Hannah about it.",
      "\u201cI did have that falling out with Huda and we never really resolved that,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that would need to be resolved post-villa, but I\u2019m not closing myself off to any of them.\u201d",

    "summary": "After unprecedented attacks on Iran, the U.S. and Israel have shifted toward an ambitious diplomatic push in the Middle East.",
    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 As the dust settles on Iran after unprecedented Israeli and American attacks, the U.S. and Israel have shifted their focus toward an ambitious diplomatic push they hope will translate into the kind of enduring political stability that has evaded the region for decades.",
      "Despite apparent Iranian unwillingness, President Donald Trump is pushing for more talks with Tehran about its nuclear program. But Israel appears more interested in formalizing diplomatic relations with some of its long-standing adversaries, as well as ending the 18-month conflict in Gaza \u2014 which Trump has repeatedly pleaded for.",
      "\u201cThis victory presents an opportunity for a dramatic widening of peace agreements,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe are working on this with enthusiasm.\u201d",
      "The previous Trump administration brokered what it called the Abraham Accords, in which Israel established diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain and later normalized its relations with Morocco in 2024 and Sudan, though that deal has yet to be ratified.",
      "Having devastated the powerful, Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, its northern neighbor, and seen a Tehran-friendly regime toppled in Syria to the east, Israel is now interested in establishing formal diplomatic relations with both countries, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday",
      "The shift represents a broader change in Israeli policy toward its neighbors. Until around two weeks ago, Israel\u2019s modus operandi was to assert military dominance as a political strategy, according to Michael Oren, who served as the country\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. from 2009 to 2013.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s the first time that I\u2019ve seen in history when we have the opportunity to make the strategy the strategy. It\u2019s not a tactic,\u201d Oren, a former member of Israel\u2019s Knesset, or parliament, who served as deputy minister in the prime minister\u2019s office, told NBC News in a phone call on Friday.",
      "Before the Hamas-led terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel relied on a method known in Hebrew as \u201cmowing the grass.\u201d The term was used by strategists to describe the country\u2019s periodic attacks against Palestinian militants and their supply of weapons in Gaza, attacks that faced widespread criticism from rights groups often because of the disproportionate number of deaths caused by Israeli forces.",
      "The phrase could also apply to Israel's behavior toward Iran and its proxies in taking out military commanders, nuclear scientists and senior advisers to the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while attacking nuclear and military sites. In Lebanon, it has wiped out large swaths of Hezbollah\u2019s leadership.",
      "Today, Netanyahu\u2019s most formidable challenge will be finding a resolution to end the conflict in Gaza, where, despite nearly 20 months of war, Hamas remains nominally in control.",
      "Under pressure from Trump, who on Truth Social on Sunday again called for a \u201cdeal in Gaza\u201d and to \u201cget the hostages back,\u201d the negotiations are also still captive to the same disagreements that have long delayed a deal.",
      "Hamas has refused to release its remaining hostages and surrender \u2014 key demands of far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s government, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, his national security minister, both of whom have threatened to quit and bring down the fragile coalition if he does otherwise. Along with other lawmakers they have also called for the complete destruction of Hamas.",
      "Hamas, meanwhile, has demanded a permanent truce, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and guarantees about humanitarian aid.",
      "The decline of power in Iran, Hamas' primary patron, will likely sap the group\u2019s confidence and influence, according to Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, an independent research center.",
      "\u201cFrom an Israeli standpoint, this is a dramatic shift in the acceptance for the Jewish state in the region,\u201d added Plesner, a former member of the Israeli parliament.",
      "But he cautioned that as long as Hamas is the governing body in Gaza, a deal to end the war there \u201cwill be something that is possible but it will be very difficult for the Israeli government to swallow.\u201d",
      "For now, Israel is in the ascendancy: Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been badly damaged, its 46-year-old Islamic regime is weakened and its proxy groups and allies throughout the region have been extensively damaged.",
      "Perhaps most important is that while the Israeli and U.S. attacks on Iran were publicly criticized, they were also quietly welcomed by its Arab neighbors, many of whom were quicker to condemn Iran\u2019s reprisal attack on the U.S. military base in Qatar than the American attack on Iran.",
      "For decades Iran has fostered allied regimes and proxy militia throughout the Middle East in order to fight Israel, its major ally in the region, the United States, and Shiite-majority Iran\u2019s adversaries among the Sunni-led Gulf kingdoms.",
      "Israel will now need those states to blaze a path toward an enduring peace, analysts said, or risk inflaming regional conflict even more.",
      "\u201cI think we see imperial Iran is in retreat,\u201d Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an associate professor of political science at the United Arab Emirates University in Al Ain, said in a phone interview last week. \u201cIt probably means a more stable Middle East, a more stable region.\u201d",
      "Israel and the United States would do better to cultivate what Abdullah described as an \u201cAxis of Moderation\u201d of monied Gulf Arab kingdoms, many of whom have normalized relations with Israel \u2014 a play on the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d used to describe Iran and its regional proxy groups that Israel has largely defeated.",
      "Israel has nonetheless made clear its intention to continue attacking Iran\u2019s nuclear program should a perceived need arise. And in Gaza and Lebanon, it has continued to launch regular strikes against what it says are militant targets long after ceasefires were put in place.",
      "But Trump, whose angry outburst appeared to rein in an Israeli strike on Iran after he declared a ceasefire in the region, has shown he is capable of halting Israel\u2019s responses. Oren said this could help pave the way toward lasting stability by restraining Israel\u2019s more militant instincts.",
      "\u201cThe difference between tactics and strategy is in the hands of Donald Trump,\u201d Oren said. \u201cTo the greatest extent in Israel\u2019s history, our fate is in the hands of one person, and it\u2019s not the prime minister.\u201d"

Three Palestinians were killed after the military intervened. Israeli security forces arrested five settlers.",
      "Far-right Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has often defended Israelis accused of similar crimes, offered a rare condemnation of Sunday's violence. \"Attacking security forces, security facilities, and IDF soldiers who are our brothers, our protectors, is a red line, and must be dealt with in full severity.

      "At least 71 people were killed in Israel\u2019s attack on Tehran\u2019s Evin prison, a notorious facility where many political prisoners and dissidents have been held, Iran\u2019s judiciary said on Sunday.",
      "Judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir posted on the office\u2019s official Mizan news agency website that those killed on Monday included staff, soldiers, prisoners and members of visiting families. It was not possible to independently verify the claim.",
      "The June 23 attack, the day before the ceasefire between Israel and Iran took hold, hit several prison buildings and prompted concerns from rights groups about the safety of the inmates.",
      "It remains unclear why Israel targeted the prison, but it came on a day when the Defense Ministry said it was attacking \u201cregime targets and government repression bodies in the heart of Tehran.\u201d",
      "The news of the prison attack was quickly overshadowed by an Iranian attack on a U.S. base in Qatar later that same day, which caused no casualties, and the announcement of the ceasefire.",
      "Jahangir did not break down the casualty figures but said the attack had hit the prison\u2019s infirmary, engineering building, judicial affairs and visitation hall, where visiting family members were killed and injured.",
      "On the day of the attack, New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran criticized Israel for striking the prison, seen as a symbol of the Iranian regime\u2019s repression of any opposition, saying it violated the principle of distinction between civilian and military targets.",
      "At the same time, the group said Iran was legally obligated to protect the prisoners held in Evin, and slammed authorities in Tehran for their \u201cfailure to evacuate, provide medical assistance or inform families\u201d following the attack.",

More than 1,000 people were killed, including at least 417 civilians, according to the Washington-based Human Rights Activists group.",
      "In retaliation, Iran fired more than 550 ballistic missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted, but those that got through caused damage in many areas and killed 28 people.",
      "While both sides have been adhering to the truce, Iranian officials raised suspicions Sunday about whether Israel would continue to keep its word.",

      "Sitting off the Horn of Africa, the Yemeni island of Socotra was largely left to its own devices for centuries, its few guests arriving to trade for aromatic frankincense, the healing plant aloe and the crimson sap of the dragon\u2019s blood tree, used for dyes.",
      "Roughly the size of New York\u2019s Long Island, Socotra is about 140 miles off the coast of Somalia, a remote location that has allowed a unique ecosystem to flourish. It has a rich array of bird and animal life, and the coral reefs off its shores teem with colorful marine life. One-third of its 825 plant species cannot be found anywhere else on Earth, according to UNESCO.",
      "Some, including conservationist Kay Van Damme, have called it the Gal\u00e1pagos of the Indian Ocean and along with other experts, he is warning that millions of years of evolution on Socotra could be under \u201cserious threat.\u201d",
      "\u201cClimate change is by far the biggest threat to the island\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d Van Damme, who has worked on Socotra for more than two decades, told NBC News in a call last month. \u201cIt is a relatively small island with a predominantly arid climate. Even small additional impacts from climate change can have an outsized effect, putting further pressure on fragile ecosystems.\u201d",
      "Prolonged droughts brought on by climate change are compounding damage from devastating cyclones in 2015 and 2018 that destroyed reefs, eroded soil and uprooted rare plants.",
      "The island\u2019s lifeblood, endemic species of frankincense trees, are also under threat. Four of the 11 recognized species on the island were classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in March.",
      "Five were recognized as endangered.\u201cTheir decline reflects the wider degradation of terrestrial habitats across the island and the ecosystems they support,\u201d said Van Damme, adding that overgrazing \u2014 predominantly from goats \u2014 is another significant challenge, leading to habitat degradation and \u201cleaving behind overmature trees with fewer younger trees to replace them.\u201d",
      "Tourism\u2019s growing footprint",
      "Attracted by Socotra\u2019s pristine beaches, turquoise waters and surreal flora, tourists are also placing mounting pressure on the island\u2019s fragile ecosystem.",
      "While there is only a handful of hotels, mostly in the capital Hadibo, a growing number of tour operators offer luxury camping and 4x4 tours around the island, some of which are packaged as ecotourism.",
      "Authorities have agreed to limit the number of tourists to around 4,500 per year, Ali Yahya, a local conservationist and tour operator, said in an interview last month, adding that when it came to \u201cvery sensitive areas in terms of ecosystems, biodiversity and cultural heritage, it\u2019s strictly not allowed to build any big buildings or large-scale hotels.\u201d",
      "But despite Socotra\u2019s UNESCO World Heritage designation \u2014 requiring preservation under international agreements \u2014 violations occur frequently, another local guide, Abdulraoof al-Gamhi, said in a series of voice and written messages last month.",
      "\u201cSome tourists build fires under dragon blood trees, carve inscriptions into rare trees, leave trash behind them and scare birds with their drones,\u201d he said. But he added that many of the island\u2019s residents benefit from tourism and that it is \u201cvery important\u201d for \u201ctour companies, car owners, drivers, restaurants, hotels and sellers of handcrafts.\u201d",
      "Echoing his concerns, Van Damme also said endangered species were \u201cbeing killed just for a selfie,\u201d with rare species like chameleons being captured so tourists can take pictures with them.",
      "Al-Gamhi also said he expected the number of tourists to rise as more people discover the unique locale, and \u201cthat will put a lot of pressure on our environment.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will be a big challenge,\u201d he added.",
      "A cautionary tale",
      "Although the Gal\u00e1pagos comparison is often used to celebrate Socotra\u2019s biodiversity, it can also serve as a warning, according to Van Damme, who co-authored a 2011 study on human impacts on the island.",
      "Since the 19th century, the Gal\u00e1pagos, remote islands some 600 miles off the coast of mainland Ecuador known for their unique flora and fauna, have lost numerous endemic species to habitat disruption, overtourism and invasive species.",
      "\u201cPerhaps Socotran ecosystems,\u201d Van Damme wrote at the time, \u201ccould now be considered as having at least, a similar state of health of those in the Gal\u00e1pagos at the time of [the Ecuadorian islands\u2019] nomination as world heritage site 30 years ago.\u201d He added that Socotra risked a similar fate without \u201ctimely conservation efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we consider the present-day condition in the Gal\u00e1pagos, we might catch a glimpse of Socotra\u2019s future, or better, what could happen if trends and threats continue in parallel,\u201d the paper added.",

      "Humanoid robots waddled, stumbled and occasionally face-planted their way through a 3-on-3 soccer tournament in Beijing on Saturday that looked more like the first day of little league than the rise of a robotic Lionel Messi.",
      "Pileups were frequent as players toppled over each other in slow-motion collisions, goals were left open, and defending appeared optional. Some robots hogged the ball, others struggled to stay upright, and two or three had to be loaded onto a stretcher and carried off the field.",
      "While the play was absurd, the tech powering it was anything but.",
      "Each team operated fully autonomously, driven by AI, with no human intervention or supervision \u2014 an impressive breakthrough somewhat masked by the slapstick spectacle playing out on the field.",
      "Equipped with advanced visual sensors, the child-sized robots were able to identify the ball and navigate the field with some halting agility. They were also designed to stand up on their own after falling, though some did require the help of biological humans, including one who was dragged off the field after tipping over near the goal.",
      "And beneath the bloopers is a country investing tens of billions of dollars and racing to extend its lead in the field of next-gen robotics.",
      "China\u2019s robotics market is projected to grow at an annual rate of 23% and reach $108 billion by 2028 \u2014 up from the $47 billion it currently invests, according to research published by Morgan Stanley. By 2050, China is expected to have 302.3 million humanoid robots in use, far ahead of the U.S. projection of 77.7 million, the report added, noting these would likely be used for \u201crepetitive, simple, and structured work,\u201d like in factories.",
      "\u201cIt is becoming apparent that national support for \u2018embodied AI\u2019 may be far greater in China than in any other nation, driving continued innovation,\u201d said Sheng Zhong, Morgan Stanley\u2019s head of industrials research. \u201cIn our opinion, China\u2019s lead in AI-robotics may need to widen before rivals, including the U.S., pay closer attention.\u201d",
      "Sports is becoming a key part of China\u2019s push.",
      "In April, 21 humanoid robots recently competed alongside humans in a half-marathon in Beijing, though only six managed to finish. Saturday\u2019s soccer match also served as a preview for the upcoming 2025 World Humanoid Robot Games, which China will host in Beijing Aug. 15\u201317. The event will feature 11 robot sports, including gymnastics, track and field, and soccer.",
      "Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics \u2014 the company that supplied the robot players at Saturday\u2019s soccer tournament \u2014 said sports competitions are a testing ground for humanoid robots. Their successes and stumbles on the field help accelerate the development of both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.",
      "He also explained that safety is a core concern about humanoid robots.",
      "\u201cIn the future, we may arrange for robots to play soccer with humans. That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe,\u201d Cheng said, referring to a perceived risk that a heavy robot could fall on and injure a human athlete, for example.",
      "\u201cA robot and a human could play a match where winning doesn\u2019t matter, but real offensive and defensive interactions take place. That would help audiences build trust and understand that robots are safe,\u201d he said.",
      "Ironically, China\u2019s humanoids may be more entertaining than their human counterparts.",
      "With the men\u2019s national team languishing at 94th in the FIFA rankings and likely to miss out on the next World Cup, the robots at least know how to put on a show \u2014 and score.",
      "In the final, Tsinghua University\u2019s THU Robotics defeated China Agricultural University\u2019s Mountain Sea team 5\u20133 to take the championship. No shortage of goals, and no complaints from the cheering crowd."

    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "If Iran opts to pursue a clandestine nuclear weapons project, the regime would have to shore up its heavily compromised security, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Iran\u2019s top nuclear scientist was driving to his country house with his wife on an autumn day four years ago. As he slowed down for a speed bump, a remote-controlled machine gun mounted on a nearby pick-up truck fired a volley of bullets, killing him instantly, Iranian authorities said.",
      "The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the architect of a dormant nuclear weapons project known as Project Amad, illustrated in brutal fashion how deeply Israel had penetrated Iran. That vulnerability has only been exposed further in recent weeks, with Israeli air strikes killing several other scientists believed to be involved in Iran\u2019s nuclear work.",
      "Iran\u2019s political leaders now face a dilemma. After the heavy U.S. bombing of their nuclear sites and air defenses, they can strike a painful compromise with Washington and abandon their uranium enrichment program, or revive the secret weapons project masterminded by Fakhrizadeh.",
      "Unlike other countries that were able to develop nuclear weapons in secret, Iran cannot assume it will be able to keep its work hidden. Israel has demonstrated repeatedly it can evade Iran\u2019s security, uncover its clandestine nuclear activities and hunt down senior figures in the military, former intelligence officials and experts said.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s principal challenge in pursuing a covert pathway is going to be keeping it hidden from U.S. and Israeli detection,\u201d said Eric Brewer, a former intelligence official now with the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a nonprofit focusing on global security.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the key challenge, because both countries, particularly Israel, have demonstrated an ability to penetrate Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd Israel has demonstrated an ability to use kinetic force to take it out.\u201d",
      "The Israeli air force has effectively wiped out Iran\u2019s air defenses. For the moment, Iran cannot protect any target on its territory -- especially suspected nuclear sites -- from a U.S. or Israeli bombing raid, former intelligence officials said.",
      "\u201cThe Israelis have complete intelligence dominance over Iran,\u201d said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former career CIA officer and now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.",
      "\u201cIf they see something emanating as a threat, they will take it out. . .That could mean military strikes. It could be covert action.\u201d",
      "Iran has already tried once to build an atomic bomb under the veil of secrecy. It had a covert nuclear weapons project more than two decades ago, according to Western intelligence agencies.",
      "But its cover was blown in December 2002, when satellite photos emerged showing an enrichment site in the city of Natanz and a heavy water plant about 200 miles away in Arak.",
      "Iran has denied it ever had a weapons program. Archival documents stolen in 2018 by Israel\u2019s Mossad spy agency, which the U.S. says are authentic, showed detailed plans to build five nuclear weapons.",
      "According to U.S. intelligence agencies, Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons project in 2003. At that point, the secrecy around the project had been breached and Iran had reason to be anxious in the wake of a U.S. invasion in neighboring Iraq.",
      "Since then, Iran maintained what it said was a civilian nuclear program. Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment and other nuclear work gave Tehran the potential option to pursue an eventual weapon if it chose to go that route \u2013 what arms control experts call a \u201cthreshold\u201d nuclear capability.",
      "Stolen blueprints",
      "If the regime chooses to race towards a bomb, it will be calculating that nuclear weapons will discourage any adversary from trying to stage an attack or topple its leadership. And it would be following a familiar path taken by other countries that successfully pursued secret bomb projects, including North Korea, Pakistan, India and Israel.",
      "The Israeli government kept the Americans in the dark about their nuclear weapons project for years.",
      "In the 1950s, French engineers helped Israel build a nuclear reactor and a secret reprocessing plant to separate plutonium from spent reactor fuel. Israel\u2019s government to this day does not officially confirm or deny its nuclear arsenal, saying it will not be the first to \"introduce\" nuclear weapons in the Middle East.",
      "India\u2019s nuclear program also began in the 1950s, with the United States and Canada providing nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel for purely peaceful purposes. India agreed to safeguards designed to prevent the reactors and fuel from being used for weapons.",
      "But India secretly reprocessed spent fuel into plutonium in the 1960s, building up fissile material for a nuclear weapon. By 1974, India carried out its first nuclear test, code-named Smiling Buddha.",
      "Pakistan built its bomb with the help of nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, a metallurgist who stole blueprints and other information on advanced centrifuges while working at a nuclear engineering firm in Amsterdam. Khan later was linked with distributing nuclear weapons technology to Iran and North Korea among others.",
      "Khan\u2019s assistance in the 1990s proved crucial for North Korea\u2019s program. The Pyongyang regime also bought technology and hardware abroad through front companies or on the black market, according to U.N. monitors.",
      "It was America that helped Iran launch its nuclear program, before the 1979 revolution that toppled the monarchy. During the Shah\u2019s rule, through the U.S. \u201cAtoms for Peace Program,\u201d the United States provided nuclear technology, fuel, training and equipment to Iran in the 1960s, including a research reactor.",
      "Now Iran likely has no need to turn to outside partners for technical know-how, experts say. Still, the regime will have a daunting task reconstituting whatever is left of its nuclear program.",
      "Every known nuclear site in Iran was targeted in Israel\u2019s air campaign earlier this month. And then last week the U.S. launched an attack on three enrichment sites using 14 \u201cbunker buster\u201d 30,000-pound bombs and more than a dozen Tomahawk missiles. The CIA says key facilities were destroyed and the nuclear program was \u201cseverely damaged\u201d in the strikes.",
      "Despite the unprecedented damage, which is still being assessed, it\u2019s possible Iran may have the technical means to relaunch a weapons program \u2013 including enriched uranium, centrifuges and access to tunnels or other underground sites, some arms control experts say.",
      "Iran\u2019s entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium has yet to be accounted for, and it has an unknown number of centrifuges in storage that were not located at the sites bombed by Israel, NBC News has reported.",
      "Iran\u2019s most significant technical obstacle, however, could be producing uranium metal. Iran only had one known site where it could convert uranium into a solid metal state, and Israeli air strikes destroyed it in Isfahan.",
      "Iran would not be able to produce a nuclear weapon without such a facility, and it\u2019s unclear if the regime has a secret uranium metal product plant elsewhere.",
      "Technical hurdles aside, the decision whether to build a nuclear bomb ultimately will be shaped by political considerations rather than technology or logistics, according to Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.",
      "\u201cIt really is a political decision not a technical one,\" Lewis said. \"They still have a lot of capability left.\"",
      "After coming under a withering aerial assault that demonstrated Israel\u2019s air superiority, Iran may view nuclear weapons as the only way to defend itself and preserve the regime\u2019s survival, according to Marvin Weinbaum, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank and a professor at the University of Illinois.",
      "\u201cIran has every reason now, based on what\u2019s just happened, to say we\u2019ve got to have a bomb, [and] we\u2019ll be treated differently if we do,\u201d Weinbaum said.",
      "Officials in Iran\u2019s regime have long debated whether to develop nuclear weapons, and its policy over the past two decades appeared to strike a compromise, giving Tehran the option to go nuclear if circumstances required. The question for Iranian officials is whether nuclear weapons will help ensure the regime\u2019s survival or endanger its grip on power, regional analysts said.",
      "Looming over Iran\u2019s decision is the threat of Israeli espionage and air power, potentially catching Tehran in the act of rushing to produce a bomb.",
      "\u201cIt will be interesting to see whether the regime buckles down and gets serious about it, or whether their operational security remains as terrible as ever,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThey have been so careless.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff is due to hold talks on a possible agreement with Iran in coming days to try to halt its uranium enrichment in return for sanctions relief.",
      "Meanwhile, American and Israeli spy agencies \u201cwill be laser focused on trying to see what Iran is doing behind the scenes,\u201d Polymeropoulos said."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Google's much-hyped new U.K. headquarters in London's King's Cross neighborhood hasn't opened yet, but it's already drawn some unexpected attention from locals.",
      "Local foxes, that is.",
      "The building, which is under construction, has been nicknamed the \"landscraper\" because it spans 1,082 feet wide and 11 floors tall.",
      "Created by British designer Thomas Heatherwick, it will reportedly be completed later this year and cost the tech giant upwards of \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion). Construction began in 2017. It is anticipated to eventually house up to 7,000 Google employees.",
      "For now, however, some of the more frequent visitors might be the foxes that have been digging burrows in the manicured grounds and leaving their droppings behind on the building's nearly 1,000-foot-long rooftop garden.",
      "\u201cFox sightings at construction sites are pretty common, and our King\u2019s Cross development is no exception,\u201d a Google spokesperson told NBC News. But, the person added, \u201cWhile foxes have been occasionally spotted at the site, their appearances have been brief and have had minimal impact on the ongoing construction.\u201d",
      "NBC News spoke to nearly two dozen construction workers at the construction site, where a cacophony of noise from the drilling and hammering filled the streets as dust dispersed into the air. But when asked whether they had seen any foxes, most refused to comment, citing nondisclosure agreements.",
      "One worker, who requested anonymity due to the NDA, told NBC News, \u201cPersonally, I haven\u2019t seen one, but there are so many open entrances to the building I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it had gotten inside.\u201d",
      "Still, Kareen Mascerenhas, 25, who works at a store directly across from the construction site, said she had spotted a fox last winter. \u201cI was shutting the store when I saw one just run past that side and in there,\u201d she said, pointing to Google\u2019s construction.",
      "But any sightings of the bushy-tailed vulpines feel neither rare nor unique in a city where the number of foxes soars between 10,000 and 15,000, accounting for nearly 16 foxes per square mile.",
      "Around the country, their population ebbs and flows depending on the season, from 150,000 in the winter to around 400,000 during cub season, according to Terry Woods, who founded the fox removal company Fox-a-Gon, which advocates for the humane treatment of the animals.",
      "For decades, foxes have also captured the British imagination, appearing as the sly character Mr. Tod in Beatrix Potter's novels, and in Roald Dahl's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\" And most recently, one even served as a memorable symbol for the \u201chot priest\u201d in the hit television show \"Fleabag\" by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.",
      "Though they are often seen boldly trotting along sidewalks and rummaging through residential bins, foxes have also roused strong reactions from onlookers, ranging from adoration to outright resentment.",
      "\u201cThey may appear cuddly and romantic, but foxes are also a pest and a menace, particularly in our cities,\u201d former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told BBC News in 2013, then as the mayor of London, when a fox horrified the British public after biting off a baby\u2019s finger.",
      "For years, foxes perfectly concealed their identity as the main culprits behind hundreds of cat mutilations in the south London suburb of Croydon, where the grisly carcasses strewn across streets and backyards led distressed residents to suspect that a deranged cat killer was on the loose until police realized what was happening in 2018.",
      "While some residents cherish their presence, hoping to charm the typically contact-averse creatures by trying to feed them, a series of British wildlife laws also gives foxes the protection and freedom to roam the United Kingdom\u2019s cities endlessly.",
      "\u201cFoxes are quite popular around this area; they are just virtually everywhere,\u201d said 31-year-old Ode Tomitoba, who works at the King\u2019s Cross Visitors Center.",
      "For Hanei Mokenen, 23, who manages a restaurant in King\u2019s Cross, news of the latest fox incursion came by way of a TikTok video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s King\u2019s Cross, anything can happen here,\u201d he said about the bustling commercial neighborhood in Central London, adding that he had occasionally seen a fox running around the area.",
      "But their stealth around the giant Google edifice had nonetheless taken Mokenen by surprise. \u201cHow the hell did they get inside? Security is strong in this area; it\u2019s not a place where you can just walk around,\u201d he said.",
      "The foxes\u2019 newfound home at Google\u2019s offices isn\u2019t the first time the animals have made themselves comfortable in London\u2019s skyscrapers. In 2011, a fox called Romeo was discovered living in The Shard, surviving on the food scraps left by construction workers.",
      "\u201cIt is a fairly common occurrence with the creatures being so adaptable,\u201d said Woods from Fox-a-Gon, who helped remove Romeo from the site by capturing him safely and releasing him back into the urban jungle.",
      "\u201cThey are such an adaptable animal that they can survive almost anywhere and overcome great hardships,\u201d he added."

Their case against Patterson included that she disposed of a food dehydrator after the fatal meal and reset her phone multiple times.",
      "The prosecution said she lied about having a dire medical diagnosis to ensure her guests attended the lunch, cooked individual pastries to avoid poisoning herself, and faked symptoms to make it look as though she fell ill, too.",
      "But Patterson's lawyers said the poisoning was a terrible accident caused by a pantry mix-up of store-bought and wild mushrooms, which she didn't know were death caps. The defense case was that Patterson wasn't as ill as the other diners because she induced vomiting after the meal due to an eating disorder.",
      "The accused lied to the police that she had never foraged mushrooms or owned a dehydrator out of panic, her lawyers said. Patterson denied telling her lunch guests she had a confirmed diagnosis of cancer.",
      "Prosecutors offered no motive",
      "Justice Christopher Beale spent four days summarizing the case to jurors before their deliberations began, urging them not to be swayed by bias or prejudice, or by sympathy for the families of those who died. Patterson's lies, some of which she admitted during her evidence, could be used to assess her credibility but didn't mean she was guilty of murder, Justice Beale said.",
      "Prosecutors didn't offer a motive for the alleged killings and weren't required to. But they suggested a deteriorating relationship between the accused and her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, as well as her exasperation with her former in-laws, which she expressed to friends on social media months before the deaths.",
      "The defense said Erin Patterson had a positive and loving relationship with her lunch guests, who included her children's only living grandparents, and that she had no reason to kill them. Justice Beale highlighted in his summary of the case the fleeting and minor nature of the past disputes.",
      "Simon Patterson was invited to the fatal lunch but didn't go.",
      "Jurors will remain sequestered",
      "A 14-member jury heard the case, but 12 were selected by ballot Monday to decide the verdict. The jury will remain sequestered, meaning they will stay together in court-appointed accommodation until they reach a unanimous decision.",
      "Late Monday afternoon, court staff told reporters that jurors had finished deliberations for the day and would return to consider the case Tuesday. The jury is not permitted to return a verdict outside of the court's sitting hours and members are barred from discussing the case outside the jury room \u2014 even with each other.",
      "Sequestration is rare in Australia and reflects public and media fervor about the case, with several news outlets publishing live blogs that covered every moment of the trial for its more than two-month run. The lengthy fixture in the town of Morwell, Victoria, drew lines of people eager to watch proceedings each day."

      "HOVELTE, Denmark \u2014 Peering across a dense stretch of woodland outside of Denmark's capital with camouflage paint smeared across her face, 20-year-old Katrine scans the horizon for approaching threats.",
      "After nearly four months of military training, the young soldier and the rest of her unit spent early June completing their final exercises near the Danish army's barracks in Hovelte, 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "Katrine and other female soldiers, all of whom spoke to The Associated Press on June 11 on the condition that only their first names be used because of operational security, volunteered for military service earlier this year. Until now, that was the only way for women to be part of the armed forces.",
      "The Scandinavian country is seeking to increase the number of young people in the military by extending compulsory enlistment to women for the first time. Men and women can both still volunteer, and the remaining places will be filled by a gender-neutral draft lottery.",
      "\"In the situation the world is in now, it's needed,\" Katrine said. \"I think it's only fair and right that women participate equally with men.\"",
      "Under new rules passed by Denmark's parliament earlier in June, Danish women who turn 18 after Tuesday will be entered into the lottery system, on equal footing with their male compatriots. The change comes against a backdrop of Russian aggression and growing military investment across NATO countries.",
      "Russia's looming threat",
      "Even from the relative safety of Denmark, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine casts its shadow. Lessons from the Ukrainian battlefields have even filtered down into their training.",
      "\"That makes it very real,\" Katrine said.",
      "Denmark's gender-parity reforms were originally outlined in 2024 as part of a major defense agreement. The program was originally expected to be implemented by early 2027, but has been brought forward to summer 2025.",
      "Col. Kenneth Str\u00f8m, head of the conscription program, told AP the move is based on \"the current security situation.\"",
      "\"They could take part in NATO collective deterrence,\" Str\u00f8m added. \"Raising the number of conscripts, that would simply lead to more combat power.\"",
      "Denmark, a nation of 6 million people, has about 9,000 professional troops. The new arrangement is expected to bring up to 6,500 annual conscripts by 2033, up from 4,700 last year.",
      "Under Danish law, all physically fit men over age 18 are called up for military service. But because there are usually enough volunteers, there's a lottery system so not all young men serve. Women, by contrast, could only volunteer previously, making up roughly a quarter of 2024's cohort.",
      "\"Some will probably be very disappointed being chosen to go into the military,\" Anne Sofie, part of Katrine's cohort of volunteers, said of the new female conscripts. \"Some will probably be surprised and like it a lot more than they think they would.\"",
      "The duration of service is also being extended from four to 11 months. Conscripts will first spend five months in basic training, followed by six months of operational service, plus additional lessons.",
      "Military buildup",
      "The move is part of a broader military buildup by the Nordic nation.",
      "In February, Denmark's government announced plans to bolster its military by setting up a $7 billion fund that it said would raise the country's defense spending to more than 3% of gross domestic product this year. Parts of the conscript program are being financed by the so-called Acceleration Fund.",
      "\"We see a sharpened security situation in Europe. We have the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. We have focus on the Baltic countries, where Denmark is contributing a lot of soldiers. So, I think it's a general effort to strengthen the Danish defense,\" said researcher Rikke Haugegaard from the Royal Danish Defense College.",
      "But Haugegaard notes there are many challenges, from ill-fitting equipment and a lack of additional barracks, to potential cases of sexual harassment.",
      "\"For the next year or two, we will be building a lot of new buildings to accommodate all these people. So, it will be a gradual process,\" she added.",
      "In 2017, neighboring Sweden instituted a military draft for both men and women after its government spoke of a deteriorating security environment in Europe. Norway introduced its own law applying military conscription to both sexes in 2013."
