      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Jennette McCurdy\u2019s widely acclaimed memoir \u201cI\u2019m Glad My Mom Died\" will be adapted into a series on Apple TV+, with Jennifer Aniston to star in a role modeled after McCurdy's mother.",
      "The 10-episode dramedy was written by McCurdy and film producer Ari Katcher. The pair will serve as co-showrunners and will executive produce the series alongside Aniston, Apple announced Tuesday.",
      "McCurdy started acting at age 8 and rose to fame as a co-star on Nickelodeon show \u201ciCarly\u201d with Miranda Cosgrove, later reprising her role as Sam in the spinoff \u201cSam & Cat \u201dopposite Ariana Grande. Her memoir recounts being \u201cemotionally, mentally and physically abused\u201d by her mother throughout her childhood.",
      "The show will center around the \u201ccodependent relationship\" between a young female actor in a popular kid's show and her \"narcissistic mother,\u201d according to the statement. No casting has been announced for the child star, who is described by Apple as being 18.",
      "McCurdy's bestselling book released in August 2022, following years of therapy the actor said was vital in allowing her to fully deal with her mother's death due to cancer complications in 2013.",
      "The title is attention-grabbing and, she said, entirely true.",
      "\u201cWith my mother\u2019s death, I\u2019d go from being so, so deeply angry to then feeling just so sorry for her. And so I could feel compassion and sympathy and then just anger and rage,\u201d McCurdy told The Associated Press in 2022. \u201cI\u2019d cry because I missed her and I\u2019d be angry that I was crying that I missed her and feel she doesn\u2019t deserve these tears. I think abusive love is so complicated ... It\u2019s going to be mixed and messy.\u201d",
      "McCurdy's book detailed the difficulties in handling her fame while simultaneously navigating her mother's illness.",
      "\u201cAs agonizing as it is to be in the ambulance with my mother while she\u2019s convulsing in the middle of a seizure, to look up and see my face (on a billboard) felt like my life was mocking me,\" McCurdy told the AP.",
      "Aniston's casting follows her collaboration with Apple TV+ on \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d which she also stars in and executive produces. The show's fourth season is set to premiere Sept. 17.",

Starting in July, all seven of us will begin working closely together on new music,\u201d the band said in a statement. \u201cSince it will be a group album, it will reflect each member\u2019s thoughts and ideas. We\u2019re approaching the album with the same mindset we had when we first started.\u201d",

Six of the group\u2019s seven members served in the army, while Suga, the last to return, fulfilled his duty as a social service agent, an alternative to military service.",
      "Jin, the oldest BTS member, was discharged in June 2024. J-Hope was discharged in October.",

K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges. However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",

      "Since then, the festival\u2019s security and organization have grown increasingly professional, sparking regret from some fans who feel it has lost its alternative spirit.",
      "The 2016 festival coincided with the U.K.\u2019s referendum on European Union membership, and the decision to leave the bloc \u2014 which most young people opposed \u2014 overshadowed the event. Many performers mentioned Brexit and the dispirited mood, including headliner Adele, who urged people to \u201clook after each other.\u201d",
      "Performers have often vented their opposition to politicians from the stage. In 2019, rapper Stormzy led the crowd in \u201cF___ Boris\u201d chants aimed at then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. This year, Irish rappers Kneecap directed the same expletive at Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "In contrast, then-Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was warmly received at the festival in 2017 after doing better than expected against the Conservatives in a general election.",
      "Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza has provoked heightened emotions that spilled over onto Glastonbury\u2019s stages.",
      "Before the event, some politicians called for Glastonbury to cancel a performance by Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap, whose pro-Palestinian comments, critics say, have crossed a line into support for violence.",
      "Kneecap member Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh has been charged under the Terrorism Act with supporting a proscribed organization for allegedly waving a Hezbollah flag at a concert in London in November. He denies the charge, and Kneecap has accused critics of trying to silence the band because of its support for the Palestinian cause.",
      "Kneecap\u2019s energetic set included plenty of pro-Palestinian comments and criticism of the government. But it was the act that preceded them, Bob Vylan, that caused a furor when a member of the duo led chants of \u201cdeath to the IDF,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "The Avon and Somerset Police force said officers would review video evidence \u201cto determine whether any offenses may have been committed that would require a criminal investigation.",
      "Michael and Emily Eavis said Bob Vylan had \u201cvery much crossed a line.\u201d They said \u201cthere is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s publicly funded national broadcaster is under fire for showing Bob Vylan\u2019s set, one of dozens of Glastonbury performances it streamed live online.",
      "The BBC said Monday that it should have cut off the broadcast after the \u201cantisemitic\u201d and \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d comments, and has removed the performance from its website. But the government is demanding to know what \u201cdue diligence\u201d it did on Bob Vylan before the broadcast.",
      "Some media experts say the broadcaster is in a difficult position. Steven Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster, said Britain\u2019s influential right-wing press,\u201d including newspapers such as the Daily Mail and The Sun, frequently attack the BBC, \u201cfor both commercial and ideological reasons.\u201d",
      "Right-leaning newspapers featured the Bob Vylan story prominently, and Barnett said that attention \u201cputs any political leader under enormous pressure\u201d to express an opinion.",

      "Refugee children in Kenya's Kakuma camp are turning to dance to cope with harsh conditions",
      "KALOBEYEI, Kenya -- Beads of sweat drip from the faces of young girls and boys as they dance to the rhythm of traditional drums and open calabashes, while their peers watch them in awe.",
      "These are refugee children, some who were born in one of Africa\u2019s largest camps \u2014 Kakuma, located in northern Kenya, where more than 300,000 refugees\u2019 livelihoods have been affected by funding cuts that have halved monthly food rations.",
      "The children use the Acholi traditional dance as a distraction from hunger and have perfected a survival skill to skip lunches as they stretch their monthly food rations that are currently at 30% of the U.N nutritional recommendation per person.",
      "The Acholi people, mostly from Uganda and South Sudan, are among refugees who live in Kakuma camp, which was established in 1992 as a safe haven for people fleeing conflict from dozens of east African countries.",
      "For a moment, the melodious sound of one of the refugee mothers stops the playground buzz of activity as dozens of children sit down to enjoy the traditional dance performance.",
      "The colorful swings doting the community center at Kakuma\u2019s Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement were donated by a Swiss organization, Terre des hommes, which still manages the playground aptly named \u201cFuraha\u201d \u2014 Swahili for Happiness.",
      "But the happiness of these children isn't guaranteed now as funding cuts have affected operations here. Fewer resources and staff are available to engage the children and ensure their safety.",
      "One of the dancers, Gladis Amwony, has lived in Kakuma for 8 years now. In recent years, she has started taking part in the Acholi traditional dances to keep her Ugandan roots alive.",
      "The now 20-year-old doesn't imagine ever going back to Uganda and has no recollection of life in her home village.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happiest when I dance, I feel connected to my ancestors,\u201d the soft-spoken Amwony says after her dance session.",
      "While Amwony and her friends are looking for a cultural connection, just about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from their village in neighboring Kalobeyei Village 3, some boys are in touch with modernity.",
      "The five boys have been practicing a one-of-a-kind dance where they mimic robots, complete with face masks that hide their human faces.",

      "The boys will be part of performances that will be showcased during this year\u2019s World Refugee Day, as an example of the talent and resilience that exists among the refugee community.",
      "This younger generation of dancers make precision moves in a small hall with play and learning items stored in a cabinet that is branded with an American flag, an indication that it was donated by the U.S government.",
      "Such donations are now scarce, with the United States having cut down on funding in March.",
      "These cuts have affected operations here, with the future stardom hopes for these children dimming by the day.",

      "\u201cWe are now reducing some of the activities because we are few. The staff are few and even per day we only have one staff remaining in the center and it is really hard for him/her to conduct 500 children,\u201d said John Papa, a community officer for Terre des hommes in Kalobeyei Village 3.",
      "These programs do more than entertain the children \u2014 they keep them away from issues such as child labor, abuse and crime which as a major concern for humanitarian organizations in Kakuma.",
      "And as the children dance and play beneath the sweltering sun, the only hope is that these child friendly spaces remain operational for years.",

      "VENICE, Italy -- The Italian city of Venice was making waves Friday with the most anticipated wedding of 2025 \u2014 that of billionaire Jeff Bezos and his fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez. The sky itself is no limit for this couple who have traveled into space, and expectations are about as high.",
      "One of the world\u2019s most enchanting cities as backdrop? Check.",
      "Star-studded guestlist and tabloid buzz? Of course.",
      "Local flavor? You bet.",
      "Beyond that, the team of the world\u2019s fourth-richest man has kept details under wraps. Still, whispers point to events spread across the lagoon city, adding complexity to what would have been a massive logistical undertaking even on dry land.",
      "On Thursday, dozens of private jets touched down at Venice\u2019s airport as yachts pulled into the city\u2019s famed waterways. Aboard were athletes, celebrities, influencers and business leaders, converging to revel in extravagance that is as much a testament to the couple\u2019s love as to their extraordinary wealth.",
      "The heady hoopla recalled the 2014 wedding in Venice of actor George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, when adoring crowds lined the canals and hundreds of well-wishers gathered outside City Hall.",
      "Not so for these nuptials, which have become a lightning rod for protests.",
      "Still, any desire to dampen the prevailing fever pitch has yet to materialize. Instead, the glitterati were set to party, and the paparazzi jostling for glimpses of the gilded gala.",
      "Whatever happens, it will be a wedding for the ages.",
      "Venice is famed for its network of canals, where gondoliers croon for lovestruck couples and even ambulances are aquatic. But water transport of everything from bouquets to guests makes Venice among the world's most challenging cities for a party, according to Jack Ezon, CEO of luxury travel advisory and event planner Embark Beyond.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very tight-knit community; everyone there knows everyone, and you need to work with the right people,\u201d said Ezon, whose company has put on a dozen high-end events in Venice. \"There\u2019s very tight control, especially on movement there with boats.\u201d",
      "It at least triples the cost versus staging the same soiree in Rome or Florence, he said.",
      "Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia was first to give an estimated tally for the Bezos/S\u00e1nchez bash: He told reporters this week the most recent total he saw was between 40 million and 48 million euros (up to $56 million).",
      "It\u2019s an eye-popping, jaw-dropping figure that's over 1,000 times the $36,000 average cost of American couples' weddings in 2025, according to wedding planning website Zola\u2019s annual report.",
      "Bezos\u2019 team has been tight-lipped about where these millions are going. When the youngest son of Asia\u2019s richest man married last July, performances by pop stars Rihanna and Justin Bieber pushed up the price tag.",
      "\u201cHow do you spend $40 million on a three- or four-day event?\u201d Ezon said. \u201dYou could bring headliners, A-list performers, great DJs from anywhere in the world. You could spend $2 million on an incredible glass tent that\u2019s only there for 10 hours, but it takes a month to build,\" or expand the celebration to local landmarks.",
      "There's no sign S\u00e1nchez and Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, intend to take over any of Venice\u2019s tourist-thronged hotspots. Still, intense hand-wringing about the prospect prompted their wedding coordinator, Lanza & Baucina, to issue a rare statement calling those rumors false.",
      "On Thursday, a string of water taxis cut through the lagoon to bring Bezos, S\u00e1nchez and guests to the Madonna dell\u2019Orto cloister as some onlookers cheered. Paparazzi followed in their own boats, trying to capture guests on camera \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom \u2014 as police on jet skis patrolled.",
      "Local media have reported the couple will hold a ceremony Friday on San Giorgio island, across the lagoon basin from St. Mark\u2019s Square. Associated Press journalists circling the island Thursday saw workers assembling tents and private security personnel stationed at every pier, including a newly built one.",
      "Media have also reported a reception Saturday in the Arsenale, a former navy base best known as a primary venue for the Venice Biennale.",
      "There are some who say these two should not be wed in this city.",
      "They characterize the wedding as a decadent display of wealth in a world with growing inequality, and argue it's a shining example of tourism taking precedence over residents\u2019 needs, particularly affordable housing and essential services. Venice is also one of the cities most vulnerable to rising sea levels from climate change.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 are protesting under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words referring to his space exploration company Blue Origin and the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "Greenpeace unfurled a banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square denouncing Bezos for paying insufficient taxes. Activists floated a bald-headed Bezos-inspired mannequin down a Venice canal atop an Amazon delivery box, its hands clenching fake cash.",
      "Authorities \u2014 from Venice's mayor to the nation\u2019s tourism minister \u2014 have dismissed the outcry, saying it ignores the visibility and economic boost the wedding brings.",
      "\u201cThere will be photos everywhere, social media will go wild over the bride\u2019s dress, over the ceremony,\u201d Italy\u2019s tourism minister, Daniela Santanch\u00e8, told the AP.",
      "\u201cAll of this translates into a massive free publicity campaign. In fact, because they will spend a lot of money, they will enrich Venice \u2014 our shopkeepers, artisans, restauranteurs, hotels. So it\u2019s a great opportunity both for spending and for promoting Italy in the world.\u201d",
      "As Amazon\u2019s CEO, Bezos usually avoided the limelight, frequently delegating announcements and business updates to his executives. Today he has a net worth of $231 billion, according to Forbes.",
      "In 2019, he announced he was divorcing his first wife, MacKenzie Scott, just before the National Enquirer published a story about an affair with S\u00e1nchez, a former TV news anchor. S\u00e1nchez filed for divorce the day after Bezos\u2019 divorce was finalized.",
      "He stepped down as CEO in 2021, saying he wished to spend more time on side projects, including Blue Origin, The Washington Post, which he owns, and his philanthropic initiatives.",
      "Sitting beside S\u00e1nchez during an interview with CNN in 2022, he announced plans to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime.",
      "Last week, a Venetian environmental research association issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d CORILA, which seeks protection of the Venetian lagoon system, said contact began in April, well before any protests.",

      "Lalo Schifrin, the composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, died Thursday. He was 93.",
      "Schifrin\u2019s sons William and Ryan confirmed his death to trade outlets. The Associated Press\u2019 messages to Schifrin\u2019s publicist and representatives for either brother were not immediately returned.",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \u201cCool Hand Luke,\u201d \u201cThe Fox,\u201d \u201cVoyage of the Damned,\u201d \u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d and \u201cThe Sting II.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe movie dictates what the music will be.\u201d",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan. But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \u201conly the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\u201d by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\u201cThe producer called me and told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it\u2019s going to start with a fuse,\u2019\u201d Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \u201cSo I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that\u2019s why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\u201d",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin\u2019s music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin\u2019s music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\u201cI remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\u201d Giacchino told NPR. \u201cAnd I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, \u2018Just have fun with it.\u2019 And I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cMission: Impossible\u201d won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996\u2019s first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand\u2019s Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band. Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie\u2019s quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \u201cGillespiana.\u201d",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965\u2019s \u201cJazz Suite on the Mass Texts\u201d while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV\u2019s \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \u201cTango,\u201d \u201cRush Hour\u201d and its two sequels, \u201cBringing Down The House,\u201d \u201cThe Bridge of San Luis Rey,\u201d \u201cAfter the Sunset\u201d and the horror film \u201cAbominable.\u201d",
      "Writing the arrangements for \u201cDirty Harry,\u201d Schifrin decided that the main character wasn\u2019t in fact Clint Eastwood\u2019s hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\u201cYou would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cI wrote a theme for Scorpio.\u201d",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\u201cReceiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\u201d Schifrin said at the time. \u201cIt is mission accomplished.\u201d",
      "Among Schifrin\u2019s conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California\u2019s Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \u201cChristmas in Vienna\u201d in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \u201cLetters from Argentina,\u201d nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event\u2019s 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \u201cSongs of the Aztecs.\u201d The work premiered at Mexico\u2019s Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site\u2019s Aztec temple.",
      "\u201cI found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \u201cBut the real answer is that there\u2019s something magic about it. ... There\u2019s something magic in the art of music anyway.\u201d",
      "In addition to his sons, he\u2019s survived by his daughter, Frances, and wife, Donna.",

    "story": [
      "Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, has died at 91",
      "NEW YORK -- Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91.",
      "Moyer died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. He did not cite Moyers' cause of death.",
      "Moyer\u2019s career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson\u2019s press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \u201cThe CBS Evening News\u201d and chief correspondent for \u201cCBS Reports.\u201d",
      "But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV\u2019s most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.",
      "In 1988, Moyers produced \u201cThe Secret Government\u201d about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \u201cJoseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\u201d a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.",
      "His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men\u2019s Movement, and his 1993 series \u201cHealing and the Mind\u201d had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.",
      "In a medium that supposedly abhors \u201ctalking heads\u201d \u2014 shots of subject and interviewer talking \u2014 Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \u201cThe question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\u201d",
      "Demonstrating what someone called \u201ca soft, probing style\u201d in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.",
      "From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn\u2019t necessarily deny.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people\u2019s ideas,\u201d he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d operating independently, outside the establishment.",
      "Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \u201cthe conversation of democracy open to all comers,\u201d he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\u201d he said another time, \u201cbut they\u2019ve chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.",

      "Bruce Springsteen isn't the only musician to complete or launch anticipated album projects, then to see it never see the light of day",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea that Bruce Springsteen wrote, recorded and ultimately shelved entire albums of music may seem odd to the casual listener. Why put yourself through all that work for nothing?",
      "Yet \u201clost albums\u201d are embedded in music industry lore. Some were literally lost. Some remained unfinished or unreleased because of tragedy, shortsighted executives or creators who were perfectionist \u2014 or had short attention spans.",
      "Often, the music is eventually made public, like Springsteen is doing now, although out of context from the times in which it was originally made.",
      "So in honor of Springsteen's 83-song \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums\u201d box set being released Friday, The Associated Press has collected 10 examples of albums that were meant to be but weren't.",
      "Back in the news with the death of Brian Wilson, this album \u201cinvented the category of the lost masterpiece in popular music,\u201d says Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. Some of the material that surfaced suggested Wilson, the Beach Boys' chief writer, was well on his way: the majestic single \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d the centerpiece \u201cHeroes and Villains\u201d and the reflective \u201cSurf's Up.\u201d Wilson succumbed to internal competitive pressure worsened by mental illness and drug abuse while making it in 1966 and 1967, eventually aborting the project. He later finished it as a solo album backed by the Wondermints in 2004. The better-known songs were joined with some psychedelic-era curios that displayed Wilson's melodic sense and matchless ability as a vocal arranger, along with lyrics that some fellow Beach Boys worried were too \u201cout there.\u201d",
      "The mercurial Prince pulled back this disc, set for release in December 1987, at the last minute. Some promo copies had already slipped out, and it was so widely bootlegged that when Warner Bros. officially put it out in limited release in 1994, the company billed it as \u201cThe Legendary Black Album.\u201d Encased in an all-black sleeve, the project was said to be Prince's nod to Black fans who may have felt they had lost him to a pop audience. It's almost nonstop funk, including a lascivious Cindy Crawford tribute and the workout \u201cSuperfunkycalifragisexy.\u201d The maestro's instincts were well-placed, though. Coming after \u201cSign O' the Times\u201d \u2014 arguably his peak \u2014 this would have felt like a minor project.",
      "Written and recorded in 2003, Green Day's \u201cCigarettes and Valentines\u201d was actually lost; someone apparently stole the master tapes. Feeling on a creative roll, the rock trio decided against recreating what they'd done and pressed on with new material. Smart move. The result was \u201cAmerican Idiot,\u201d the band's best work. Perhaps the robbery was \u201cjust a sign that we made a crappy record and we should make a better one,\u201d songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong told MTV. The title cut later surfaced on a 2010 live album. The rest was lost to time.",
      "To say anticipation was high for Dr. Dre\u2019s third album when he started recording in 2002 puts it mildly. The theme disc about a hitman, which Dre described as a \u201chip-hop musical,\u201d had an all-star squad of contributors including Eminem, 50 Cent, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes and Kendrick Lamar. \u201cI\u2019d describe it as the most advanced rap album musically and lyrically we\u2019ll probably ever have a chance to listen to,\u201d co-producer Scott Storch told MTV. But we never have. When he announced a different third album in 2015, Dre explained on his radio show what happened to \u201cDetox\u201d: \u201cI didn\u2019t like it. It wasn\u2019t good. ... I worked my ass off on it, and I don\u2019t think I did a good enough job.\u201d",
      "A series of unfinished demos, \u201cBlack Gold\u201d was a taste of where guitar god Jimi Hendrix might have gone creatively if he hadn't died at 27 in 1970. He was composing a song suite about an animated Black superhero, says Tom Maxwell, whose podcast \u201cShelved\u201d unearths stories behind lost music. Hendrix sent a tape of his work to longtime drummer Mitch Mitchell for advice on fleshing it out. That music was set aside at Mitchell's home and forgotten for two decades after Hendrix died. To date, Hendrix's estate has made only one of these recordings public, a song called \u201cSuddenly November Morning.\u201d Hendrix, after clearing his throat, slips in and out of falsetto while accompanying himself on an acoustic guitar.",
      "Written while Yoko Ono was separated from John Lennon during his infamous \u201clost weekend\u201d in 1973-74, \u201cA Story\u201d had the potential of changing the musical narrative around her. It was a strong album \u2014 without the avant-garde stylings that made Ono a challenge for mainstream listeners \u2014 recorded with musicians who worked on Lennon's \u201cWalls & Bridges.\u201d Maxwell calls it \u201can emancipation manifesto\u201d that was set aside when Ono reconciled with Lennon. She's never publicly explained why, Maxwell says, although one song seems clearly about an affair she had while Lennon was away. Some of the material from \u201cA Story\u201d was included as part of the \u201cOnobox\u201d project that came out in 1992, and the album was released separately in 1997. Ono also re-recorded some of its songs in 1980, and Lennon was holding a tape of her composition \u201cIt Happened\u201d when he was shot and killed. In it, she sings about an unspecified, seemingly traumatic event: \u201cIt happened at a time of my life when I least expected.\u201d That wasn't even the most chilling premonition. Her song \u201cO'Oh\u201d ended with firecrackers that sound like gunshots. It was left off the 1997 release.",
      "Guns N' Roses was at the top of the hard rock world when they began recording a new album in 1994. It didn't go well. Inconclusive sessions slogged on for years, and all but singer Axl Rose left the group. Recording costs exceeded a staggering $13 million, by some accounts the most expensive rock album ever. One witness told The New York Times in 2005: \u201cWhat Axl wanted to do was to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. You could go on indefinitely, which is what they've done.\u201d When \u201cChinese Democracy\u201d was finally released in 2008, the world yawned.",
      "Not even a decade after the triumph of \u201cWhat's Going On,\u201d Marvin Gaye was floundering. His \u201cHere, My Dear\u201d divorce album flopped, he struggled with drugs and searched for relevance in the disco era. The single \u201cEgo Tripping Out,\u201d meant to herald a new album, laid bare the problems: Over a melody cribbed from Donna Summer's \u201cHot Stuff,\u201d the famously cool \u201cLove Man\u201d boasted like an insecure rapper. He scrapped the album, repurposing some its material for the 1981 disc \u201cIn Our Lifetime,\u201d a process so fraught he bitterly left his longtime label Motown. Gaye went to CBS, made a huge comeback with \u201cSexual Healing,\u201d then was shot dead by his father in 1984.",
      "Neil Young rivals Prince in the volume of material left in his vault, and he's been systematically releasing much of it. The mostly acoustic \u201cHomegrown\u201d was recorded as 1974 bled into 1975, during Young's breakup with actor Carrie Snodgress. Instead of releasing it in 1975, he put out another heartbreak album, the well-regarded \u201cTonight's the Night,\u201d about losing friends to drug abuse. When Young finally dropped \u201cHomegrown\u201d in 2020, he wrote in his blog, \u201cSometimes life hurts. This is the one that got away.\u201d",
      "Of the discs included in Springsteen's \u201cTracks II\u201d set, this was reportedly the closest to being released, in the spring of 1995. After the success of the Oscar-winning song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia,\u201d Springsteen recorded an album in the same vein, with a synthesizer and West Coast rap-inspired drum loops setting the musical motif. Strikingly contemporary for its time, Springsteen ultimately felt it was too similar to previous releases dominated by dark stories about relationships. \u201cI always put them away,\u201d he said of his lost albums. \u201cBut I don't throw them away.\u201d",

      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years",
      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years. The next entry, and first since Daniel Craig's dramatic exit, may test that \u2014 but things are speeding up.",
      "On Wednesday, Amazon MGM Studio announced that Denis Villeneuve will direct the 26th Bond movie, putting the franchise in the hands of one of the most respected big-budget filmmakers. Here's what to know about that decision, and where things stand for 007.",
      "Villeneuve, the 57-year-old French Canadian director, edged out other filmmakers who were reportedly eyed for the gig, including Edward Berger (\u201cConclave\u201d) and Paul King (\u201cPaddington 2\u201d). Since emerging with 2010's \u201cIncendies,\" Villeneuve has established himself as a steward of cinematic IP (\"Blade Runner 2049,\" \u201cDune\u201d) and a specialist in dark, doom-laden spectacle (\"Sicaro,\" \u201cArrival\u201d).",
      "\u201cJames Bond is in the hands of one of today\u2019s greatest filmmakers,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.",
      "The culmination for Villeneuve has been the \u201cDune\u201d films. His first two entries have surpassed $1 billion in box office and gathered a combined 15 Academy Award nominations, winning seven. Villeneuve is expected to begin shooting the third \u201cDune\u201d film this summer, with a cast including Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Zendaya and Javier Bardem.",
      "\"I\u2019m a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he\u2019s sacred territory,\u201d said Villeneuve. \u201cI intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.\u201d",
      "Amazon, which bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $8.5 billion, hasn't set a release date yet or announced a screenwriter. Producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman are shepherding the movie for the first time. In February, Amazon MGM Studios secured creative control of the franchise from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, whose family has presided over Bond since the first film, 1962's \u201cDr. No.\u201d",
      "The most likely timing would be production starting in 2026 and the film being released sometime in 2027.",
      "No new 007 has been named, but that hasn't stopped rumors and conjecture from running rampant.",
      "It's pure speculation buts oddsmakers have a few expected contenders for the martini-sipping role. Those include Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Theo James, Aaron Pierre, Henry Cavill, James Norton and Jack Lowden. Expectations are that the new Bond will remain male and British, but producers have said nothing publicly to tip their hand.",
      "Whoever it is will have big shoes to fill. In his five-film, 15-year stretch in the tuxedo, Daniel Craig was widely seen as one of the best Bonds, including the high point of \u201cSkyfall\u201d (2012) and the swan song of \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d (2021).",
      "Since Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli obtained the movie rights to Ian Fleming's books, James Bond has been a family business. That didn't change after Amazon bought MGM, but it did earlier this year when Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli agreed to let the studio take creative control.",
      "That handoff stoked concern from many Bond fans that 007 would be picked apart for spinoffs, series and the kind of intellectual property strip mining Hollywood has been known for in other franchises like \u201cStar Wars.\u201d So far, though, Amazon MGM has made no announcement about any spinoffs, and is prioritizing the 26th Bond movie.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u201ccommitted crime after crime\u201d but thought his \u201cfame, wealth and power\u201d put him above the law, a prosecutor told jurors Thursday as the hip-hop mogul\u2019s sex trafficking trial shifted to closing arguments.",
      "\u201cThat ends now,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to find the defendant guilty.\u201d",
      "Combs, 55, sat with his head down as Slavik highlighted testimony and evidence from the seven-week trial that she said proved sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and other charges. Wearing a sweater and khakis, he sometimes scribbled notes to his lawyers and shook his head as Slavik played one of his audio messages for the jury.",
      "\u201cOver the last several weeks, you\u2019ve learned a lot about Sean Combs,\u201d Slavik said, launching into a nearly five-hour presentation. \u201cHe\u2019s the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\u201d",
      "Among the proof, Slavik argued, was evidence that Combs kidnapped an employee, was involved in setting rapper Kid Cudi\u2019s convertible ablaze, bribed a hotel guard and carried out \u201cbrutal crimes at the heart of this case.\u201d",
      "Combs \u201cagain and again forced, threatened and manipulated\u201d his ex-girlfriends Cassie and Jane into \u201chaving sex with escorts for his own entertainment,\u201d Slavik said, her lectern directly in front of jurors.",
      "The prosecutor said Combs forced or coerced Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, and Jane, who testified under a pseudonym, to engage in dayslong sex marathons known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights\u201d with drugs, violence, or by threatening financial harm or the release of video recordings of some of the hundreds of encounters.",
      "\u201cUp until today, the defendant was able to get away with these crimes,\u201d Slavik said.",
      "Bookending the trial\u2019s start, jurors again saw now-infamous security footage of Combs hitting, kicking and dragging Cassie at the Intercontinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016 after she tried to leave a freak-off with a male sex worker.",
      "\u201cHe knew exactly what he was doing. That is sex trafficking,\u201d Slavik told the jury, adding that Combs was \u201cknowingly using force and coercion to get Cassie back to that room where the escort was waiting.\u201d",
      "Slavik said Combs \u201ccounted on silence and shame\u201d to enable and prolong his abuse. He used a \u201csmall army\u201d of employees, including personal assistants and bodyguards, to harm women and cover it up, she said.",
      "The theory of racketeering law is that \u201cwhen someone commits crime as part of a group, they\u2019re more powerful and dangerous,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant was a powerful man, but he became more powerful and dangerous because of his inner circle, his businesses \u2014 the enterprise.\u201d",
      "Combs and his inner circle \u201ccommitted hundreds of racketeering acts,\u201d she said.",
      "Members of Combs\u2019 family, including several of his children, watched from wooden benches in the packed courtroom. At one point, he gave them a thumbs-up.",
      "Since his arrest at a Manhattan hotel last September, Combs and his lawyers have insisted he is innocent, though they conceded at trial that domestic violence occurred.",
      "Combs \u201cwas abusive: physical, emotional, psychological, sexual abuse,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant doesn\u2019t deny the abuse. They just want to call it \u2018domestic violence\u2019 and claim it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the crimes charged.\u201d",
      "The defense will give its closing argument on Friday, followed by a prosecution rebuttal argument. Then, Judge Arun Subramanian said, he will instruct jurors on the law before deliberations begin.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers built their case for acquittal through lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Some testified only in response to subpoenas and insisted they didn't want to be there.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers contend there was no racketeering conspiracy because no employees agreed to join any conspiracy.",
      "In her closing, Slavik said employees repeatedly agreed to commit crimes for Combs, including delivering him drugs; accompanying him to kidnap his personal assistant; and locking Cassie in a hotel room after he stomped on her face.",
      "As Slavik returned repeatedly to the topic of Combs\u2019 sex marathons, jurors saw a slide that said \u201cThe Freak Offs\u201d next to a photo of him laying on a bed bathed in red light.",
      "Slavik reminded jurors of text messages and testimony that showed that the women didn't want to participate, including one in which Jane told Combs that she felt he gave her no choice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s dark, sleazy and makes me feel disgusted with myself. I feel it\u2019s the only reason you have me around and why you pay for the house,\u201d Jane wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head.\u201d",

      "Issey Miyake\u2019s menswear line has returned to Paris Fashion Week with a dazzling show at the Cartier Foundation",
      "PARIS -- As Paris wilted under the ruthless June sun, Issey Miyake sent out a battalion of intergalactic fashion soldiers at the Cartier Foundation Thursday, shimmering between art and menswear apparel in a spectacle where even the light was a player. The late-morning sun bounced sharply off the art museum's monumental steel pillars, forcing some guests to slide their seats to escape the dazzling reflections \u2014 an impromptu game of musical chairs set to a pulsing, kinetic soundtrack.",
      "This Paris Fashion Week season finds the Miyake house in the midst of transition. In January, Paris bid adieu to Homme Pliss\u00e9 \u2014 Miyake\u2019s pleated cult favorite that had anchored the city\u2019s menswear calendar since 2019 \u2014 as the brand shifted its focus to nomadic shows, most recently appearing under the Tuscan sun. The torch in Paris has now been passed to IM Men, the last line personally conceived by Issey Miyake before his death in 2022. Thursday\u2019s show marked IM Men\u2019s return to the Paris stage, under the direction of designers Sen Kawahara, Yuki Itakura, and Nobutaka Kobayashi.",
      "The theme, \u201cDancing Texture,\u201d nodded to the ceramic artistry of Shoji Kamoda, but also to the surreal choreography on display. Models appeared to roll, tilt, and swing through the light, their movements somewhere between ballet and a slow-motion video game. Occasionally, a guest would squint, unsure if they were watching a runway show or a heat-induced hallucination.",
      "The crowd \u2014 equal parts Parisian cool, visiting editors, and those for whom a pleated culotte is a spiritual calling \u2014 dodged the sun's glare and fanned themselves in the heat, shifting for both comfort and the best sightline. The first model glided out in a mad, angular hat, setting the tone for a parade of tin man-meets-space ninja silhouettes designed for dance floors or distant planets.",
      "The clothes themselves looked as if they had been engineered for a new climate \u2014 or perhaps a new species. Surfaces peeled, rippled, and shimmered, metallic foils flashed against the sun, and jacquard weaves evoked the carved waves of Kamoda\u2019s ceramics. Vermilion and white motifs burst forth alongside a near-neon green, courtesy of upcycled fishing nets. A coat unzipped into a dramatic collar while some blousons and pants, when laid flat, formed perfect circles \u2014 a wink at Kamoda\u2019s wheel-thrown plates.",
      "Miyake, who died in 2022, loomed large over the collection, his vision unmistakable in every engineered pleat and playful transformation. IM Men is the last line he conceived \u2014 a living laboratory for innovation, risk, and occasional absurdity, now energetically interpreted by a younger team. Even in his absence, his legacy is alive in every joke, fold, and jolt of surprise on the runway.",
      "Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake rose from postwar Japan to become a global force, transforming fashion in the 1980s and \u201990s with his radical, sculptural vision. He pioneered heat-set pleating and created lines like Pleats Please and A-POC that blurred the boundaries between art, science, and daily life. Miyake\u2019s designs liberated fabric, allowing it to move with the body and imagination alike.",
      "Of course, the fashion house\u2019s embrace of the avant-garde still courts danger. Thursday's spectacle occasionally veered into excess, with kinetic art and sci-fi headgear that threatened to upstage the clothes themselves \u2014 a familiar Miyake risk. But the best moments, like a pared-back tangerine overcoat that floated past, proved restraint can sometimes steal the show.",

      "Channel 156 has been SiriusXM Fight Nation, which has carried pro wrestling, MMA and boxing shows.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited,\u201d said Dave LaGreca, the longtime host of \u201cBusted Open,\u201d which started as a one-hour weekly show in 2009. \u201cI really owe it to our fans. They've really been dedicated and asked for this for years. It's a dream come true to actually see it form. And now, it's about to happen.\u201d",
      "\u201cBusted Open\u201d expanded to five days a week in 2018 before going to six days one year later. It will have a live episode seven days a week from 9 a.m.-noon EDT on the new channel featuring LaGreca with wrestling stars Bully Ray, Mark Henry and Tommy Dreamer.",
      "The show has appealed to fans of both WWE and AEW with video clips of interviews getting plenty of engagement on social media.",

      "Five nights a week there will be a \u201cBusted Open After Dark\u201d program, where fans can call in and react after WWE and AEW shows.",
      "\u201cThe great thing is we're not associated with WWE or AEW, so we can give our honest opinion about both products,\u201d said LaGreca, who signed a multi-year extension with SiriusXM. \u201cThe fact that there is a little bit of tension between those two companies and even the fans, it makes it even better for what we\u2019re doing on air. The fact that there are more companies that are succeeding at record-breaking levels is even better for our brand, and the big reason why we\u2019re going 24/7.\u201d",
      "Pro wrestling also can claim \u2014 at least on satellite radio \u2014 for being on an level playing field with professional sports leagues and major college conferences in having a dedicated channel.",
      "\u201cThe appetite for wrestling content continues to increase, and we\u2019re able to uniquely meet the demand of those fans by delivering a new 24/7 channel just for them,\u201d said Jared Fox, SiriusXM's Senior Vice President for Sports Programming, Content Marketing & Partnerships, and Artist Relations. \u201cWe have a long track record of building dedicated sports channels that fans love.\"",
      "LaGreca said he is hoping to add more analysts as well as continue to seek input from fans on possible additions or lineup changes.",

    "story": [
      "Eva Victor's \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is one of the more thrilling filmmaking debuts in recent years, writes Associated Press Film Writer Jake Coyle in his review",
      "The first thing to love about writer-director-star Eva Victor\u2019s extraordinary debut \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is how she, as the young professor Agnes, tries, and fails, to hide a tryst with her neighbor.",
      "Agnes lives in a quaint New England home where her best friend and fellow former grad student Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is visiting. We are just getting to know each of these characters when a knock comes on the door. Gavin (Lucas Hedges) stands outside confused when Lydie answers. Agnes rushes over to act as though he\u2019s mistaken her house for his, and not for the first time.",
      "\u201cGod bless your lost soul,\u201d she says, shooing him away.",
      "The plot of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d centers around a traumatic experience for Agnes that unfolds in a chapter titled \u201cThe Year With the Bad Thing.\u201d But it would be wrong to define \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d \u2014 or its singular protagonist \u2014 by that \u201cbad thing.\u201d In this remarkably fully formed debut, the moments that matter are the funny and tender ones that persist amid crueler experiences.",
      "Before her script to \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d attracted Barry Jenkins as a producer, Victor did improv and made comic social media videos. And the degree to which she\u2019s effectively channeled her sly sense of humor and full-bodied resistance to cliche makes \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d the immediately apparent revelation of a disarmingly offbeat new voice.",
      "The film unfolds in five chapters from across five years of Agnes\u2019 life, told out of chronology. That, in itself, is a way to place the \u201cbad thing\u201d of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d in a reshuffled context. Stasis, healing and friendship are more the guiding framework of Victor\u2019s film.",
      "The opening tenor of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is, in a way, the prevailing one. Agnes and Lydie (a terrific Ackie) are best pals whose jokey chemistry is as natural as their protectiveness of each other. At a dinner with their former literature grad students, Lydie clasps Agnes\u2019 hand under the table at the mention of their former thesis adviser.",
      "In the second chapter, the \u201cbad thing\u201d one, we find out why. In an unnamed New England liberal arts school, their professor, Preston Decker (Louis Cancelmi), is charming and perceptive. He recognizes Agnes\u2019 intelligence and seems to respect her \u2014 which makes his betrayal all the more shattering. When the location of one of their meetings shifts last-minute to his home, Victor\u2019s camera waits outside while day turns to night. Only when Agnes exits, ashen and horrified, do we pick back up with her as she gets in the car and drives.",
      "In the aftermath, the trauma of the rape spills out of Agnes in unpredictable ways and at unexpected moments. With Lydie. Visiting a doctor. At jury duty. With a stray cat. These encounters \u2014 some heartwarming, some insensitive \u2014 are both Agnes\u2019 way of awkwardly processing what she went through and the movie\u2019s way of accentuating how people around you, friend or stranger, have a choice of empathy. Most movingly, in the chapter \u201cThe Year With the Good Sandwich,\u201d John Carroll Lynch plays a man who finds her having a panic attack, and sweetly sits down with her in a parking lot.",
      "Agnes doesn\u2019t process her experience the way a movie character might be expected to \u2014 with, say, revenge or sudden catharsis. Hers is a sporadic, often absurd healing that includes turning up at her neighbor\u2019s house to borrow some lighter fluid. Lydie is key. This is in many ways a portrait of a friendship, and a particularly lived-in one at that. What it\u2019s not so much is a story about sexual assault. Just as Agnes is sarcastically and self-deprecatingly resistant to convention, Victor\u2019s film sidesteps the definitions that usually accompany such a story. Originality becomes a kind of survival.",
      "\"Sorry, Baby,\u201d an A24 release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for sexual content and language. Running time: 104 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "The sequel to the horror-comedy hit \u201cM3GAN\u201d takes a bold turn into action territory",
      "If you want to know how big an upgrade the \u201cM3GAN\u201d sequel has on the original, look no further than the very first scene. \u201cM3GAN\u201d was mostly set in a Seattle house, but \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d starts at the Turkish-Iranian border \u2014 with a murderous rampage in a secret military installation and the presence of Saudi intelligence, with U.S. Defense Department officials covertly watching.",
      "Two hours later, it's not clear if this is really an upgrade.",
      "Most of the same team that gave us the refreshing horror-comedy original two years ago have not only gone super-big, but also changed the franchise's genre, turning \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d into an action movie with two AI robots, two villains, FBI units, wingsuits, neural implants, a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d-style vault heist, exosuits, a 250-mph street chase in a supercar, a power grid disaster, a countdown clock, the United Nations and the fate of the planet at stake.",
      "If the evil doll M3gan in the first movie was responsible for the deaths of four humans and one dog, this time the screen is littered with the corpses of shootings, decapitations, severed limbs and laser slayings. There are double-crosses, impalings, blood splatter, cattle prods, tactical military soldiers, self-destruct sequences and insane close-combat martial arts. You can be forgiven for expecting a Tom Cruise appearance.",
      "What you won't get is much of the vibe of the original, which fused horror, cultural commentary and humor. This time, that's muted in favor of an overly ambitious, horribly convoluted plot that sometimes feels like the moviemakers just threw money at the sequel and tried to ape other franchises by going massive. The first had a bedroom feel; the new one starts, like we said, on an international border. The original's $12 million budget has been tripled.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d owes a lot to \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day,\u201d in which the robot killer in the first movie becomes the robot hero of the second. M3gan, it will come as no surprise, wasn't killed at the end of the original. She's just been laying low, waiting for her time to seize the day \u2014 and dance. Now she is reborn to fight another, better AI robot, played with sinister lethality by Ivanna Sakhno.",
      "\u201cM3GAN\u201d arrived in 2023 just as AI technology like ChatGPT was beginning to go mainstream. Director and screenwriter Gerard Johnstone turns Allison Williams \u2014 who plays M3gan's creator, Gemma \u2014 into a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of artificial intelligence as the sequel opens. One of the more intriguing questions the movie explores is if parents are gradually outsourcing their responsibilities to technology.",
      "Her niece Cady \u2014 the fabulous Violet McGraw \u2014 is now a budding computer programmer and rebellious. She has learned aikido and has a strong affinity for Steven Seagal, a running gag. Her protection is still the single focus of M3gan, who has apparently been in cloud networks between movies.",
      "Facing a global existential threat, Gemma is convinced to build a body for M3gan to go toe-to-toe with the military-grade AI killing machine known as Amelia. \u201cEveryone deserves a second chance,\u201d Cady tells her aunt. But whose side is M3gan really on? And what does Amelia really want?",
      "Some of the movie's best parts are when M3gan and Amelia face off. \u201cYou're not family to them,\u201d the new AI model says to the old. \u201cYou're just the help.\u201d There's some cool robotic dancing \u2014 a highlight of the original \u2014 and a return of M3gan's camel-colored silk sateen dress that became popular at Halloween.",
      "Johnstone has smartly kept the offbeat humor of the original, this time with clever nods to \u201cKnight Rider\u201d and a surreal use of the Kate Bush song \u201cThis Woman\u2019s Work.\u201d Jemaine Clement from \u201cFlight of the Conchords\u201d has fun as an arrogant tech billionaire, while Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps return as Gemma\u2019s tech teammates, this time crawling through ducts or getting choked almost to death.",
      "We wouldn't be here if someone had taken the advice of Ronny Chieng's character in the original movie: \u201cI want you to take this cyborg puppet show and put it in a dark closet where it belongs.\u201d Not after grossing $180 million worldwide. \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d was inevitable, but it didn't have to be so inevitably too much.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 for \u201cstrong violent content, bloody images, some strong language, sexual material and brief drug references.\u201d Running time: 120 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose granted the preliminary injunction sought by a coalition of attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit filed in early May.",
      "DuBose said the states had shown \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d from the cuts and were likely to prevail in their claims that \u201cHHS\u2019s action was both arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe executive branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,\u201d DuBose wrote in a 58-page order handed down in U.S. district court in Providence.",
      "Her order blocks the Trump administration from finalizing layoffs announced in March or issuing any further firings. HHS is directed to file a status report by July 11.",
      "The ruling applies to terminated employees in four different divisions of HHS: the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Center for Tobacco Products within the Food and Drug Administration; the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families and employees of regional offices who work on Head Start matters; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. eliminated more than 10,000 employees in late March and consolidated 28 agencies to 15. Since then, agencies including the CDC have repeatedly rescinded layoffs affecting hundreds of employees, including in branches that monitor HIV, hepatitis and other diseases.",
      "The attorneys general argued that the massive restructuring was arbitrary and outside of the scope of the agency's authority. The lawsuit also says the action decimated essential programs and pushed burdensome costs onto states.",
      "\u201cThe intended effect \u2026 was the wholesale elimination of many HHS programs that are critical to public health and safety,\u201d the lawsuit argued.",
      "The cuts are part of a federal \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d directive to streamline costly agencies and reduce redundancies. Kennedy told senators at a May 14 hearing that there is \u201cso much chaos and disorganization\" at HHS.",
      "But the restructuring had eliminated key teams that regulate food safety and drugs, as well as support a wide range of programs for tobacco, HIV prevention and maternal and infant health. Kennedy has since said that because of mistakes, 20% of people fired might be reinstated.",

      "A New York doctor has pleaded guilty to multiple counts of rape and sexual abuse",
      "NEW YORK -- A doctor pleaded guilty Monday to sexually abusing sedated patients at his New York City hospital and raping women who were unconscious at his home.",
      "Zhi Alan Cheng admitted to abusing seven women, including three female patients he was treating at New York-Presbyterian Queens hospital, the Queens district attorney's office said.",
      "Cheng, now 35, was arrested in 2022 after a female acquaintance discovered a video of him abusing her at his home while she was passed out. Searches of his home and devices uncovered video evidence of the doctor abusing women at his home and workplace, according to prosecutors. They also discovered liquid anesthesia.",
      "He has remained in jail and has been barred from practicing medicine. Cheng faces up to 24 years in prison at sentencing, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cThe level of violence and perversion displayed by Zhi Alan Cheng in sexually abusing multiple victims is compounded by the fact that he took an oath to do no harm as a medical professional,\" said District Attorney Melinda Katz. \u201cI thank the brave victim who initially came forward and exposed this abuse.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors alleged Cheng abused an eighth woman who was a patient at the hospital. He entered an Alford plea on that charge, meaning that he did not admit guilt but acknowledged that prosecutors have enough evidence to convict them.",
      "Most of the victims had no memory of the abuse and were sedated. One of the women woke up to in the middle of an assault after she had been sedated for a gastrointestinal procedure, prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors have said that New York-Presbyterian officials cooperated in the criminal investigation.",
      "\u201cAs caregivers, we are responsible for the safety and wellbeing of our patients. It is a sacred trust. The crimes committed by this individual are heinous, despicable, and a fundamental betrayal of our mission and the patients\u2019 trust. We are deeply sorry for all that the victims and their families have endured,\u201d New York-Presbyterian hospital spokesperson Angela Karafazli said in a statement.",
      "Chen's attorney, Jeffrey Einhorn, thanked prosecutors for the plea agreement and said: \u201cThe charges to which Mr. Cheng has pleaded guilty today are extraordinarily serious.\"",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 \u201cYou have no moral right to die.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s what Olha Kurtmalaieva told herself as she lay in intensive care, her body shutting down after emergency chemotherapy. Her cancer had progressed to Stage 4, meaning it had spread to other parts of her body and was now incurable. The pain was unbearable. The doctors weren\u2019t sure she\u2019d make it through the night.",
      "She was facing death alone in the Ukrainian capital, while her soldier husband was in Russian captivity in the more than three-year war.",
      "\u201cIf I die now, who will bring him back?\" Olha thought to herself. \"He has no one else in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Against the odds, she learned she was in remission last year. But even after multiple prisoner exchanges, including one that freed over 1,000 people, her husband, a Ukrainian marine, remains a captive.",
      "She hasn\u2019t given up. At nearly every exchange, she\u2019s there waiting, one of hundreds of Ukrainian women still trying to bring home their husbands, sons and brothers.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s everywhere in my life,\u201d Olha said. \u201cHis (photo) is on my phone screen, in my wallet, on the kitchen wall, in every room.\u201d",
      "Day and night, questions circled in her mind: \u201cWhat can I do to speed this up? What did I do today to bring him home?\u201d",
      "Olha was just 21 when she learned she had cancer. It was Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, Stage 2. The tumors were growing but were still treatable.",
      "\u201cAt that age, you\u2019re thinking: cancer? Why me? How? What did I do?\u201d she recalled. Her husband, Ruslan Kurtmalaiev, promised to stay by her side through every round of chemotherapy.",
      "When they met, in 2015, he was 21 and she was just 15. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t love at first sight,\u201d she said with a wide smile, eyes sparkling.",
      "Their attraction blossomed gradually that summer in Berdiansk, in what is now the Russian-occupied zone in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. Three years later, as soon as she turned 18, they wed.",
      "When they first met, it was not long after Russia illegally seized Crimea, Ruslan's homeland, in 2014, and also invaded eastern Ukraine. Ruslan, a professional soldier, had already served on the front line.",
      "From the beginning, Olha understood that life as a military wife meant constant sacrifice \u2014 long separations, missed milestones, and the uncertainty of war. But she never imagined that one day she would be waiting for her husband to return from captivity.",
      "When she describes Ruslan, tears well up in her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s kind, he has a heightened sense of justice,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cFor him, it was a matter of principle to return home and bring our Crimea home,\u201d she said, a loss she fully comprehended only after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "\u201cOnly when I lost my home did I fully understand him.\"",
      "Olha managed to complete only two sessions of chemo before the full-scale invasion. When her long hair began to fall out, she shaved her head. When she sent Ruslan a photo, he didn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cGod, you\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he told her.",
      "Later, he made a confession.",
      "\u201cHe told me, \u2018Yeah, I saw your hair falling out in the mornings. I gathered it all from your pillow before you woke up \u2014 so you wouldn\u2019t get upset.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she believed that losing her hair was the worst thing that could happen to her. But soon after, she discovered what real tragedy meant.",
      "Olha never made it to her third round of chemo.",
      "She stayed in Berdiansk, which was seized by Russian forces in the early days of the war. Cut off from medical care and waiting for news of Ruslan, she quietly began helping the Ukrainian military from inside occupied territory.",
      "\u201cThere was no oncology department in Berdiansk. There was simply nowhere to get treated,\u201d she said. \u201cBut honestly, I didn\u2019t even care that much at the time.\u201d",
      "In early April, she discovered that Russians had captured Ruslan and others from his marine forces\u2019 unit.",
      "\u201cI started to cry, but then I stopped myself. I thought, \u2018Wait. Is this something to cry about? He\u2019s alive. That\u2019s what matters.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she said, their idea of Russian captivity was naive. Only later did it become synonymous with torture, starvation and medical neglect.",
      "Olha left Berdiansk in June of 2022.",
      "\u201cWalking through your own city, but feeling like it\u2019s someone else\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s horrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were Russian flags everywhere. I kept Ukrainian music in my headphones. I was scared my Bluetooth might disconnect, and they\u2019d kill me. But it was worth it.\u201d",
      "She spent several months moving between cities, helping to organize peaceful rallies to raise awareness about Ukrainian POWs. Eventually, she settled in Kyiv. Throughout that time, she paid little attention to her cancer diagnosis, even as her health steadily declined.",
      "Then her condition worsened sharply. Her temperature spiked to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).",
      "\u201cWhen the doctor looked at my test results, she said, \u2018How are you even walking?\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Her lymphoma, left untreated during occupation, had progressed to Stage 4. Emergency chemotherapy began \u2014 and it hit her hard.",
      "\u201cMy second round of chemo was disastrous,\u201d she said. She developed an intestinal blockage, couldn\u2019t digest food, and was rushed to intensive care. \u201cIt was morphine all night from the pain. I couldn\u2019t stand. I couldn\u2019t sit. They moved me like a dead body.\u201d",
      "In the hospital, she overheard doctors say her condition was inoperable. Then a nurse came to her bedside and spoke plainly.",
      "\u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to try to restart your system manually,\u2019 she told me. \u2018But if it doesn\u2019t work, you may not wake up tomorrow. You must help us however you can.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was the thought of Ruslan, still in captivity, that helped Olha survive.",
      "In April 2024, five days before her birthday, Olha was told she was in remission. Now she juggles civic activism with running an online cosmetics store. She co-founded the Marine Corps Strength Association, representing over 1,000 Ukrainian POWs still in captivity.",
      "In close contact with former prisoners, Olha gathers fragments of information about Ruslan \u2014 she has had only one phone call with him in the past three years. She sent several letters but never received a reply.",
      "Like an investigator, she pieces together every detail. That\u2019s how she discovered that Ruslan had broken ribs and a crushed arm during regular beatings, according to the testimony of one of the POWs.",
      "As part of the psychological torture, he is made to listen to the Russian national anthem repeatedly. A Crimean Tatar and a Muslim, he is given only Christian religious texts to read \u2014 not the worst form of pressure, Olha acknowledges, but still a clear violation of his faith.",
      "One day, a Russian guard struck him eight times on the head with a hammer.",
      "\u201cThe other prisoners said they had never seen bruises like that in their lives,\u201d she said.",
      "Ruslan spent months in solitary confinement. And yet, somehow, he remains emotionally strong.",
      "\u201cHe tells the others about me,\u201d Olha said, her voice softening. \u201cOne of the guys who came back said (Ruslan) told him: \u2018She\u2019s your age, but she\u2019s got a business, she\u2019s strong, she\u2019s fighting for us. She\u2019ll get us out.\u2019\u201d",
      "That story stayed with her.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t afford to be weak. How can a marine\u2019s wife be weak?\u201d Olha said. \u201cWhat matters is that he knows I\u2019ll keep fighting for him \u2014 until the very end.\"",

      "A new Idaho law restricting public benefits for undocumented immigrants is facing a legal challenge",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- An Idaho doctor and four residents are challenging a new state law that halts some of the few public benefits available to people living in the U.S. unlawfully, including a program that provides access to life-saving HIV and AIDS medication for low income patients.",
      "The ACLU of Idaho filed the federal lawsuit Thursday night on behalf of Dr. Abby Davids and four people with HIV who are not named because they are immigrants without lawful permanent residency.",
      "The complaint says the new law is vague, contradicts federal law and makes it impossible for health care providers to determine exactly what kind of immigration status is excluded and how to verify that status for patients. They want a judge to grant them class-action status, expanding any ruling to other impacted people.",
      "Dozens of patients treated by one Boise-area clinic stand to lose access to HIV and AIDS medication under the law, according to the complaint, including several cared for by Davids.",
      "\u201cWithdrawing HIV treatment from her patients will not only have devastating consequences on their health, it raises the public health risk of increased HIV transmission,\u201d the ACLU wrote in the lawsuit. \u201cWhen her patients are undetectable, they cannot transmit the virus. Without HIV treatment, however, they cannot maintain an undetectable viral level and therefore are able to transmit the virus to others.\u201d",
      "The new Idaho law takes effect July 1, and appears to be the first limiting public health benefits since President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to enhance eligibility verification and ensure that public benefits aren't going to ineligible immigrants.",
      "The law requires people to verify that they are legal U.S. residents to receive public benefits like communicable disease testing, vaccinations, prenatal and postnatal care for women, crisis counseling, some food assistance for children and even access to food banks or soup kitchens that rely on public funding.",
      "Federal law generally prohibits immigrants in the U.S. illegally from receiving taxpayer-funded benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Social Security. But there are some exceptions for things like emergency medical care and other emergency or public health services.",
      "Idaho\u2019s law still allows for emergency medical services. But in a June 18 letter to health care providers, Idaho Division of Public Health administrator Elke Shaw-Tulloch said HIV is a long-term condition and not an emergency \u2014 so people must verify their lawful presence in order to get benefits through the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.",
      "The HIV patients challenging the new law include a married couple from Columbia with pending asylum applications, a man who was brought to the U.S. when he was just 4 years old and has Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status until next year, and a man from Mexico who has been living and working in Idaho since 2020.",
      "One of the patients said she and her husband were diagnosed with HIV in 2019 and immediately started antiretroviral therapy, receiving the medications at no cost through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. The medication has lowered the viral load in her body enough that it is now undetectable, she wrote in a court filing, ensuring that she won't transmit the virus to others.",
      "\u201cMy medication protected my daughter while I was pregnant because it prevented me from transmitting HIV to her during pregnancy,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The treatment allows her to be with her child, watching her grow, she said.",
      "Davids has been trying for weeks to get clarity from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare about exactly what kind of verification her patients will have to show, and exactly which kinds of immigration status are considered \u201clawful.\u201d But the state has yet to provide clear direction, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cI am really scared about what this means for many of our patients. Their lives will now be in jeopardy,\u201d Davids wrote in a May 30 email to the Department of Health and Welfare.",

      "Questions about thimerosal were raised in the late 1990s because it contains a form of mercury.",
      "It\u2019s not the same as the toxic type found in some seafood, called methylmercury. Instead, it\u2019s a different type called ethylmercury that the body can excrete, O\u2019Leary explained.",
      "The amount of ethylmercury per vaccine dose was small and studies found no evidence of harm. Nor was it used in all vaccines. For example, vaccines for chickenpox, polio and measles, mumps and rubella never contained it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "But as a precaution, the U.S. phased the preservative out of childhood vaccines. Since 2001, all vaccines routinely recommended for children age 6 and younger in the U.S. come in formulas that don\u2019t contain thimerosal.",
      "The exception is a small subset of flu shot formulas in multi-dose vials that could be used for adults or kids. The vast majority of children, however, get their flu vaccination from a single-dose shot instead, O\u2019Leary said.",
      "According to the CDC, 96% of all flu vaccines in the U.S. administered last fall and winter \u2014 and an even higher share of those used in federally funded programs \u2014 were thimerosal-free.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a longtime antivaccine activist, and he has long contended there was a tie between thimerosal and autism.",
      "On Thursday, his newly appointed vaccine advisers were set to hear a presentation from Lyn Redwood, a nurse practitioner who once ran the antivaccine group that Kennedy founded.",
      "She will suggest that the remaining thimerosal-containing flu shots should be removed, according to meeting materials posted earlier this week. Among the claims were that they could be a risk to pregnant women.",
      "A new CDC staff analysis prepared for the meeting again showed no link between the preservative and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Some experts note that autism rates rose after thimerosal was removed from young children's vaccines in the U.S.",

      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee backed another option to protect infants against a dangerous virus \u2014 before turning to questions about fall flu vaccines and a preservative in a small fraction of them that some antivaccine groups have falsely tied to autism.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday took up protections against RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can dangerously inflame infants' tiny airways.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality. That first antibody, called nirsevimab, proved to be 63% to 76% effective against emergency department visits for infants over the last year.",
      "On Thursday, the vaccine panel voted 5-2 that another newly approved antibody shot, Merck\u2019s clesrovimab, should be used similarly.",
      "The ACIP, created more than 60 years ago, helps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available.",
      "Kennedy was a leading voice in the antivaccine movement before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official. He fired the previous 17-member panel this month and replaced it with a seven-member group that includes several vaccine skeptics.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 months and older to get a flu shot, and helps propel the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "Presentations prepared for Thursday's meeting suggest that the panel may do much the same this year. But there's also a flu-related vote that promises controversy.",
      "It concerns thimerosal, a form of mercury that\u2019s been added to vaccines since the early 20th century to preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials.",
      "Kennedy has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger. Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with limited exceptions.",
      "Thimerosal was placed on the meeting agenda shortly after Kennedy\u2019s new vaccine advisory was named last week.",
      "Before the vote, the committee will hear from Lyn Redwood, the former president of what is now known as Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 an antivaccine group founded by Kennedy.",
      "Some public health experts contend the thimerosal discussion will unnecessarily raise doubt in vaccines while possibly also making them more expensive and harder to get this fall.",
      "At the panel's meeting Wednesday, Chrissie Juliano, executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition, lamented the ouster of the former ACIP panel and the agenda of the new one.",
      "Her organization, which represents large city health departments, \u201cis deeply concerned that many routine vaccines may soon become inaccessible or unaffordable for millions of Americans if ACIP makes changes based on ideology rather than science,\" she said. \"The stakes are simply too high to let that happen.\u201d",

      "One key issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill in Congress is particularly daunting",
      "WASHINGTON -- One key unsettled issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump's big bill in Congress is particularly daunting: How to cut billions from health care without harming Americans or the hospitals and others that provide care?",
      "Republicans are struggling to devise a solution to the health care problem their package has created. Already, estimates say 10.9 million more people would be without health coverage under the House-passed version of the bill. GOP senators have proposed steeper reductions, which some say go too far.",
      "\u201cThe Senate cuts in Medicaid are far deeper than the House cuts, and I think that\u2019s problematic,\u201d said GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.",
      "Senators have been meeting behind closed doors and with Trump administration officials as they rush to finish up the big bill ahead of the president's Fourth of July deadline. Much of the package, with its tax breaks and bolstered border security spending, is essentially drafted. But the size and scope of healthcare cuts are among the toughest remaining issues.",
      "It's reminiscent of the summer during Trump's first term, in 2017, when Republicans struggled to keep their campaign promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, only to see the GOP splinter over the prospect of Americans losing health coverage. That legislation collapsed when then-Sen. John McCain famously cast a thumbs-down vote.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune is determined to avoid that outcome, sticking to the schedule and pressing ahead with voting expected by the end of the week.",
      "\u201cThis is a good bill and it's going to be great for our country,\u201d Thune said Wednesday, championing its potential to unleash economic growth and put money in people's pockets.",
      "The changes to the federal health care programs, particularly Medicaid, were always expected to become a centerpiece of the GOP package, a way to offset the costs of providing tax breaks for millions of Americans. Without action from Congress, taxes would go up next year when current tax law expires.",
      "The House-passed bill achieved some $1.5 trillion in savings overall, a large part of it coming from changes to health care. The Medicaid program has dramatically expanded in the 15 years since Obamacare became law and now serves some 80 million Americans. Republicans say that's far too high, and they want to shrink the program back to a smaller size covering mainly poorer women and children.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans are \u201ctrying to take away healthcare from tens of millions of Americans.\u201d Democrats are uniformly opposed to what they call the \u201cbig, ugly bill.\u201d",
      "Much of the health care cost savings would come from new 80-hour-a-month work requirements on those who receive Medicaid benefits, even as most recipients already work.",
      "But another provision, the so-called provider tax that almost all the states impose to some degree on hospitals and others that serve Medicaid patients, is drawing particular concern for potential cuts to rural hospitals.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said several senators spoke up Wednesday during a private meeting indicating they were not yet ready to start voting. \u201cThat\u2019ll depend if we land the plane on rural hospitals,\u201d he said.",
      "States impose the taxes as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics decry the system as a type of \u201claundering\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide the health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the provider taxes at current levels, while the Senate proposal goes deeper by reducing the tax that some states are able to impose.",
      "\u201cI know the states are addicted to it,\u201d said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan. But he added, \u201cObviously the provider tax needs to go away.\u201d",
      "But a number of GOP senators, and the hospitals and other medical providers in their states, are raising steep concerns that the provider tax changes would decimate rural hospitals.",
      "In a plea to lawmakers, the American Hospital Association said the cuts won\u2019t just affect those who get health coverage through Medicaid, but would further strain emergency rooms \u201cas they become the family doctor to millions of newly uninsured people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd worse, some hospitals, especially those in rural communities, may be forced to close altogether,\u201d said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the hospital group.",
      "The Catholic Health Association of the United States noted in its own letter that Medicaid provides health insurance coverage for one in five people and nearly half of all children.",
      "\u201cThe proposed changes to Medicaid would have devastating consequences, particularly for those in small towns and rural communities, where Medicaid is often the primary source of health care coverage,\u201d said Sister Mary Haddad, the group\u2019s president and CEO.",
      "Trying to engineer a fix to the problem, senators are considering creating a rural hospital fund to help offset the lost Medicaid money.",
      "GOP senators circulated a proposal to pour $15 billion to establish a new rural hospital fund. But several senators said that's too high, while others said it's insufficient. Collins has proposed that the fund be set at $100 billion.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be that big, but there will be a fund,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Hawley, who has been among those most outspoken about the health care cuts, said he's interested in the rural hospital fund but needs to hear more about how it would work.",
      "He has also raised concerns about a new $35 per service co-pay that could be charged to those with Medicaid, which is in both the House and Senate versions of the bill.",
      "\u201cGetting the fund is good. That\u2019s important, a step forward,\u201d Hawley said. But he asked: \u201cHow does the fund actually distribute the money? Who will get it to hospitals? ... Or is this just going to be something that exists on paper?\u201d",
      "A new analysis from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates the package would result in up to $2.3 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years, a markedly different assessment from other analyses. In contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s dynamic analysis of the House-passed measure estimates an increase in deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade.",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded warnings about a rare heart side effect associated with the two leading COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday it has expanded existing warnings on the two leading COVID-19 vaccines about a rare heart side effect mainly seen in young men.",
      "Myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation that is usually mild, emerged as a complication after the first shots became widely available in 2021. Prescribing information from both Pfizer and Moderna already advises doctors about the issue.",
      "In April, the FDA sent letters to both drugmakers asking them to update and expand the warnings to add more detail about the problem and to cover a larger group of patients. While the FDA can mandate label changes, the process is often more of a negotiation with companies.",
      "Specifically, the new warning lists the risk of myocarditis as 8 cases per 1 million people who got the 2023-2024 COVID shots between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old. The label also notes that the problem has been most common among males ages 12 to 24. The previous label said the problem mostly occurs in 12- to 17-year-olds.",
      "The FDA\u2019s labeling change appears to conflict with some prior findings of scientists elsewhere in the U.S. government.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously concluded there was no increased risk of myocarditis detected in government vaccine injury databases for COVID-19 shots dating back to 2022. Officials also noted that cases tend to resolve quickly and are less severe than those associated with COVID-19 infection itself, which can also cause myocarditis.",
      "The FDA announcement came as new vaccine advisers appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met to debate the continuing use of COVID-19 vaccines for key groups, including pregnant women. It's the first meeting of the CDC advisory panel since Kennedy abruptly dismissed all 17 members of the group, naming a new panel that includes several members with a history of anti-vaccine statements.",
      "The FDA's label update is the latest step by officials working under Kennedy to restrict or undercut use of vaccines. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and a top deputy recently restricted annual COVID-19 shots to seniors and other Americans at higher risk from the virus. They\u2019ve also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products that require extra testing.",
      "Outside experts said the new warning is the wrong approach.",
      "\u201cThey are right to suggest that we need to consider myocarditis risks associated with the vaccine, but what they propose is exactly the wrong solution,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris, a public health specialist at the University of Washington. \u201cWe should be investigating who is prone to myocarditis to see if we can predict and mitigate that risk.\u201d",
      "Makary and several other FDA officials gained prominence during the pandemic by suggesting the federal government exaggerated the benefits of COVID-19 boosters and downplayed serious side effects, including myocarditis.",
      "Before joining the government, Makary and two of his current FDA deputies wrote a 2022 paper that said mandating booster shots in young people would cause more vaccine-related injuries than prevented hospitalizations from COVID-19 infections. The conclusion contradicted that of many leading vaccine and public health experts at the time, including at the CDC.",

Kennedy Jr.'s actions to date.",
      "\u201cThe secretary is doing the important work of leading a complex agency,\u201d Monarez told members of a Senate health committee that will decide whether to advance her nomination.",
      "Monarez, 50, is the first nominee for CDC director to require Senate confirmation. She was named acting director in January and the nominee for the post in March after Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon. Monarez is the former director of a federal biomedical research agency and a respected scientist, though she would be the first nonphysician to lead the CDC in decades.",
      "Monarez repeatedly said she had not been involved in decisions earlier this year to cut hundreds of staff and eliminate CDC programs, but that she would work to retain the agency's core functions and transition key programs to other parts of the Health and Human Services department.",
      "Her answers appeared to frustrate some senators, including Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, who said he had no questions about her qualifications.",
      "\u201cI've got questions about your willingness to follow through on your values,\u201d he said.",
      "In the two-hour hearing, Monarez was sharply questioned about Kennedy's recent move to fire all 17 members of a crucial committee that evaluates and recommends vaccines, his downplaying of the risks of measles during a nationwide outbreak and staffing cuts to a program that investigates lead poisoning in children.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the committee, sought assurances about the scientific integrity of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which was reconstituted by Kennedy to include vaccine skeptics.",
      "\u201cSomeone can speak as a critic, but there should be someone who's reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the safety of vaccines,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "Monarez said she strongly supported public health interventions, including immunizations, saying, \u201cI think vaccines save lives.\"",
      "\u201cThe ACIP has a very vital role to play,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it must make sure that it is using science and evidence to drive that decision-making.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think he has prioritized key public health activities for preventing chronic diseases,\" she added.",
      "If Monarez is confirmed, it would end a stretch of confusion at the Atlanta-based CDC, where, for months, it wasn\u2019t clear who was running the agency. The acting director's role was filled in part by Matthew Buzzelli, the CDC\u2019s chief of staff who is a lawyer and political appointee with no medical experience.",
      "Monarez holds doctorate in microbiology and immunology from the University of Wisconsin, and her postdoctoral training was in microbiology and immunology at Stanford University.",
      "At CDC headquarters in Atlanta, employees have said Monarez was rarely heard from between late January and late March, when Trump nominated her.",

      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s new vaccine advisers began their first meeting Wednesday under intense scrutiny from medical experts worried about Americans\u2019 access to lifesaving shots.",
      "First on the agenda is an awkward scenario: Kennedy already announced COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children or pregnant women, and his new advisers aren\u2019t scheduled to vote on whether they agree. Yet government scientists prepared meeting materials calling vaccination \u201cthe best protection\u201d during pregnancy \u2014 and said most children hospitalized for COVID-19 over the past year were unvaccinated.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months who could have some protection if their mom got vaccinated during pregnancy, according to the CDC's presentation.",
      "It\u2019s one signal that this week\u2019s two-day meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices isn\u2019t business as usual.",
      "Another sign: Shortly before the meeting, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist stepped down from the committee, bringing the panel's number to just seven. The Trump administration said Dr. Michael Ross withdrew during a customary review of members' financial holdings.",
      "The meeting opened as the American Academy of Pediatrics announced that it will continue publishing its own vaccine schedule for children but now will do so independently of the ACIP, calling it \u201cno longer a credible process.\u201d",
      "The panel, created more than 60 years ago, helps the CDC determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available, such as at pharmacies.",
      "Earlier this month, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices. And a number of the CDC\u2019s top vaccine scientists \u2014 including some who lead the reporting of data and the vetting of presentations at ACIP meetings \u2014 have resigned or been moved out of previous positions.",
      "The highly unusual moves prompted a last-minute plea from a prominent Republican senator to delay this week\u2019s meeting. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the chamber's health committee, said Monday that many of Kennedy\u2019s chosen panelists lack the required expertise and \u201cmay even have a preconceived bias\u201d against new vaccine technologies.",
      "In a House hearing Tuesday, Kennedy defended his purge, saying the old panel had been \u201ca template for medical malpractice.\u201d",
      "Rep. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician and Democrat from Washington state, told Kennedy: \u201cI will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet.\u201d",
      "The two-day meeting's agenda on was abruptly changed last week.",
      "Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session on Wednesday. Later in the day, the committee will take up RSV, with votes expected. On Thursday, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations and on the use of a preservative in certain flu shots.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be dangerous for infants.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality.",
      "The committee will discuss another company's newly approved antibody shot, but the exact language for the vote was not released prior to the meeting.",
      "\u201cI think there may be a theme of soft-pedaling or withdrawing recommendations for healthy pregnant women and healthy children,\u201d even though they are at risk from vaccine-preventable diseases, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University who co-authored a recent medical journal commentary criticizing the COVID-19 vaccination decision.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 month and older to get a flu shot, and helps greenlight the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "But given the recent changes to the committee and federal public health leadership, it's unclear how routine topics will be treated, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher who has studied the committee.",
      "Thursday also promises controversy. The advisory panel is set to consider a preservative in a subset of flu shots that Kennedy and some antivaccine groups have falsely contended is tied to autism. In preparation, the CDC posted a new report confirming that research shows no link between the preservative, thimerosal, and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Gostin said the agenda appears to be \u201ca combination of what we would normally expect ACIP to cover along with a mixture of potential conspiracy theories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly are in a new normal that's highly skeptical of vaccine science.\u201d",
      "The committee's recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC currently has no director, so the committee\u2019s recommendations have been going to Kennedy, and he has yet to act on a couple recommendations ACIP made in April.",
      "The CDC director nominee, Susan Monarez, is slated to go before a Senate committee on Wednesday.",

      "Anxiety, grief, sadness, anger",
      "NEW YORK -- Anxiety, grief, anger, fear, helplessness. The emotional toll of climate change is broad-ranging, especially for young people.",
      "Many worry about what the future holds, and a daily grind of climate anxiety and distress can lead to sleeplessness, an inability to focus and worse. Some young people wonder whether it\u2019s moral to bring children into the world. Many people grieve for the natural world.",
      "Activists, climate psychologists and others in the fight against climate change have a range of ways to build resilience and help manage emotions. Some ideas:",
      "Feeling isolated? Find ways to connect with like-minded people and help nature, said climate psychologist Laura Robinson in Ann Arbor, Michigan. There are many ways to get involved.",
      "Work locally to convince more residents to give up grass lawns and increase biodiversity with native plants, for instance. Help establish new green spaces, join projects to protect water, develop wildlife corridors, or decrease pesticide use to save frogs, insects and birds. Work to get the word out on turning down nighttime lighting to help birds and lightning bugs.",
      "\u201cI see people struggling with these emotions across the age range,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cI have parents who are themselves really struggling with their own feelings and really worried about their children in the future.\u201d",
      "Climate news and the onslaught of disaster and mayhem in general has become heavy and overwhelming for many with the rise of social media and mobile phone use. Try scheduling breaks from notifications on your phone or stepping back from the news cycle in other ways.",
      "Consider the idea of a \u201cpositivity sandwich,\u201d where you begin with a good piece of news, followed by a harder tidbit, then finish with a second feel-good story.",
      "Phoebe Yu, 39, gave up a cushy job in health technology to work on an MBA with a focus on sustainability. She started a business selling sponges made from the luffa gourd. And she does it all while raising her 6-year-old son with her husband in Fremont, California.",
      "\u201cI am generally a very happy person and I\u2019m very optimistic. And I\u2019m still that, but sometimes it becomes very difficult to manage. Like, what will happen and thinking about the long term,\u201d she said. \u201cAt points, I\u2019ve regretted bringing a child into this world, knowing how things could get much, much worse.\u201d",
      "Part of managing her own emotions is trying to model sustainable behaviors for her son while educating him on the importance of helping the environment. The family drives an electric vehicle. They don\u2019t eat meat and have encouraged extended family to do the same. They recycle, compost and limit travel by air.",
      "\u201cI try to explain things to my son so he can at least have some understanding of how the world and the ecosystem works as a whole,\u201d Yu said. \u201cI do think kids are able to absorb that and turn that into some level of action.\u201d",
      "Britnee Reid teaches middle school science for Gaston Virtual Academy, a K-12 virtual public school based in Gastonia, North Carolina.",
      "Reid participated in a pilot project for a free teacher tool kit on climate put together by the National Environmental Education Foundation and the Climate Mental Health Network, a collective of community advocates working on the emotional impacts of climate change.",
      "The kit is full of ways to help teachers support students\u2019 mental health and manage their own climate-related emotions. One of the exercises involves students documenting their interactions with the natural world in an environmental timeline. Laying it all out often stirs action, Reid said.",
      "\u201cThey can be anxious, they can be angry, they can feel fearful, but they\u2019re like these go-getters of, \u2018I\u2019m going to make the change in this world.\u2019 There\u2019s kind of two truths at once where they feel scared but they also feel like, you know, I can do something about this,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThe timelines,\" Reid said, \"provided some good, rich conversations.\u201d",
      "Psychotherapist Patricia Hasbach, just outside of Eugene, Oregon, has written several books on eco-psychology and eco-therapy and has taught graduate students on those topics.",
      "\u201cWe incorporate nature into the healing process,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we address a person\u2019s relationship with the natural world. Certainly with climate change, eco-therapy has a huge role to play.\u201d",
      "One of her most important missions is helping people find their words to talk about climate change in pursuit of resilience.",
      "\u201cThere have been some studies done that show an increased number of young people reporting concern, like 84% of young people in the U.S. reporting concern about climate change, but only like 59% of them think that other people are as concerned as they are,\u201d Hasbach said.",
      "That, she said, contributes to inaction and feelings of anxiety, depression or isolation.",
      "Climate scientist Kate Marvel, a physicist and author of the new book \u201cHuman Nature: Nine Ways to Feel About our Changing Planet,\u201d urges people to think differently about their place in preserving the environment.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, the anxiety and the hopelessness comes from a feeling of powerlessness. And I don\u2019t think any of us is powerless,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI think collectively, we\u2019re incredibly powerful,\" Marvel said. \"The atmosphere cares about what all of us together are doing, and I think you can have much more impact if you think of yourself as part of the collective.\u201d",

      "TALLINN, Estonia -- Authorities in Belarus continue their unrelenting crackdown on dissent even as they release some prisoners, the country's leading rights group told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "Last month, the Belarusian government pardoned and released 14 prisoners, but at least 60 more people were arrested on politically motivated charges, said Pavel Sapelka, a rights advocate with the Viasna human rights center. In May, the center counted more than 100 politically driven arrests, Sapelka said.",
      "\u201cThe steamroller of repressions doesn't stop, and the authorities continue to stifle any dissent in Belarus, opening new high-profile cases,\u201d Sapelka told the AP on Tuesday. \u201cNo one, absolutely no one can feel safe in Belarus.\u201d",
      "Mass arrests and convictions of government critics in Belarus have continued since 2020, when Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was handed a sixth term in office in an election that the opposition and the West denounced as rigged.",
      "Tens of thousands of people took to the streets in protest, in the biggest demonstrations that the country\u2019s ever seen. Authorities unleashed a violent crackdown in response, detaining and beating thousands and driving many more into exile abroad. The crackdown drew international condemnation, and the U.S. and the European Union imposed sanctions on Belarus.",
      "Viasna has recorded 1,174 people behind bars as political prisoners. The number includes 38 journalists and the group's founder, Ales Bialiatski, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022. At least eight political prisoners have died behind bars.",
      "Lukashenko, who in January secured another term in office in another election the opposition denounced as a sham, has recently been pardoning some of the political prisoners, seeking to improve ties with the West. In total, he has pardoned and freed more than 300 prisoners since July 2024, including some U.S. citizens and other foreigners.",
      "Last month, Belarusian authorities released prominent opposition figure Siarhei Tsikhanouski and 13 others and brought them to Lithuania. Their release came just hours after Belarusian authorities announced that Lukashenko met with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, in the Belarusian capital, Minsk.",
      "But rights advocates argue that the situation in Belarus hasn't changed, and authorities have recently opened several new high-profile cases, which indicates their intention to continue the crackdown.",
      "At least 20 people have been arrested in the case against Belaruski Hajun, a Belarusian activist group that monitors troops movements in Belarus, Sapelka said.",
      "Viasna on Monday also reported the arrest of popular Belarusian signer Aleh Hamenka, who is being accused of taking part in anti-government protests. Another case involves sociologists from the Wardomacki sociological research laboratory, according to Sapelka.",
      "Nils Mui\u017enieks, U.N.'s special rapporteur for human rights in Belarus, has recently said that \u201cthere is no sign of improvement in the human rights situation in Belarus, and the authorities are disregarding offers of cooperation.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- For more than a half-century, Ryland Headley got away with murder. When justice finally caught up to the former railway worker Tuesday in a British courtroom, he was 92 years old and using hearing aids to listen to his fate.",
      "A judge sentenced Headley to life in prison for the rape and murder of Louisa Dunne, a 75-year-old widow and grandmother who was strangled in her home in western England in 1967. It is believed to be the longest time in the U.K. between crime and conviction.",
      "\u201cThe violation of her home, her body and, ultimately, her life was a pitiless and cruel act by a depraved man,\u201d Justice Derek Sweeting said in Bristol Crown Court.",
      "Headley broke into Dunne\u2019s home through a window and left a palm print on the glass. Police took the hand prints of 19,000 men and boys in the area to try to solve the crime, but did not find a match at the time.",
      "Headley moved out of the area and went on to rape two older women in similar circumstances in the late 1970s and serve time in prison. But his DNA was not collected until an unrelated arrest in 2012.",
      "Last year, semen found on the blue skirt that Dunne had been wearing when she was killed was found to match Headley's DNA. His palm print was found to match the one on her window.",
      "At his trial, prosecutors had read testimony from the victims of his previous rape convictions, providing jurors with an insight into what happened when he broke into Dunne's home, said Det. Insp. Dave Marchant.",
      "\u201cHearing the voices of the victims of his 1977 offenses, is just incredibly powerful and harrowing,\u201d Marchant said.",
      "Dunne\u2019s granddaughter, Mary Dainton, who is now about the age her grandmother was when she was killed, said she had been stunned to learn of Headley's arrest in November.",
      "\u201cI accepted that some murders just never get solved and some people have to live with that emptiness and sadness,\u201d she said.",
      "On Tuesday, Dainton told the court that her grandmother's murder and rape had cast a cloud over the rest of her mother's life.",
      "\u201cThe fact the offender wasn\u2019t caught caused my mother to become and remain very ill,\" she said. \"It saddens me deeply that all the people who knew and loved Louisa are not here to see that justice is being done.\u201d",
      "Sweeting said that by escaping punishment for so long, Headley had compounded the suffering of Dunne's family.",
      "He told Headley he had to serve a minimum of 20 years in prison and would normally spend time explaining the effect of such a term. But he was blunt in this case.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll never be released and you will die in prison,\u201d Sweeting said.",

He was known for his lavish lifestyle that outraged many in Moscow just as the fighting in Ukraine exposed glaring deficiencies in Russian military organization and supplies that resulted in battlefield setbacks.",

      "VIENNA -- Dozens of people were being evacuated by helicopter in Austria on Tuesday after a mudslide covered homes and mountain huts in the Gschnitztal valley in Tyrol in the southwest of the Alpine country.",
      "The Austrian Armed Forces used a Black Hawk helicopter to fly out around 100 people from the village of Gschnitz and three mountain huts higher up. Severe thunderstorms on Monday set off a mudslide, leaving homes covered with water and debris. Roads leading to the homes were no longer accessible.",
      "The Bremerh\u00fctte, Innsbruckerh\u00fctte and Tribulaunh\u00fctte mountain huts were also no longer accessible via hiking trails due to the landslides, Elmar Rizzoli, head of Tyrol's Center for Crisis and Disaster Management, told Austria's public broadcaster ORF.",
      "Local fire department commander Lukas Braunhofer told ORF that after one of several mudslides hit the village of Gschnitz around 6 p.m. on Monday, the Gschnitzbach creek also burst its banks, leading to flooding in the area.",
      "Braunhofer said the mudslides did not appear to have injured anybody, but caused a great deal of damage. Among other things, an open-air museum with a focus on watermills was devastated.",
      "While awaiting their evacuation, residents were asked to stay indoors, not to enter underground garages and basements and also to stay away from the dams on creeks.",
      "\u201cWe are monitoring the situation closely and are in constant contact with the emergency organizations,\u201d Rizzoli said.",
      "In May, about 300 people had to be evacuated from the Alpine village of Blatten in neighboring Switzerland just days before a huge mass of rock and ice from a glacier thundered down a mountainside, sending plumes of dust skyward and coating nearly all of Blatten with mud.",

      "Franco-Algerian author Boualem Sansal is facing five years in prison in Algeria after he lost an appeal against his conviction for \u201cundermining national unity.\u201d",
      "ALGIERS, Algeria -- A court in Algeria on Tuesday upheld Franco-Algerian author Boualem Sansal's five-year prison sentence in a case that has raised alarm over freedom of expression in Algeria and pushed tensions with France to the brink.",
      "Prosecutors at an appeal hearing last week requested the maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. The \u201c2084: The End of the World\u201d author was charged in March under Algeria\u2019s anti-terrorism laws and convicted of \u201cundermining national unity,\u201d receiving his initial five-year sentence then.",
      "Sansal's appeal was closely watched in both France and Algeria. It caps a saga that has turned the novelist into a unlikely cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, uniting francophone writers, members of France's far right and European lawmakers in a rare chorus demanding his release.",
      "The issue arose last year when, in an interview with a French right-wing media outlet, Sansal questioned Algeria\u2019s current borders, arguing that France had redrawn them during the colonial period to include lands that once belonged to Morocco. The 80-year-old dual citizen was arrested the following month and later lambasted by the president in a speech to Algeria\u2019s parliament.",
      "The case has unfolded at a historic low point in Algeria's relations with France, which were strained further over the disputed Western Sahara.",
      "The territorial dispute has long helped shape Algeria\u2019s foreign policy, with its backing of the Polisario Front, a pro-independence group that operates out of refugee camps in southwestern Algeria. France last year shifted its longstanding position to back Morocco\u2019s sovereignty plan.",
      "Analysts say that Sansal has become collateral damage in the broader diplomatic fallout and describe the charges as a political lever Algiers is deploying against Paris.",
      "Sansal's supporters hope military-backed President Abdelmadjid Tebboune will grant a pardon on Saturday, when Algeria marks Independence Day and traditionally frees selected prisoners as part of a national amnesty.",
      "The timing is dire, supporters warn, as Sansal battles prostate cancer and has spent part of his detention in a prison hospital.",
      "The case has split opinion in Algeria, where many see no place for writers in prison, while others view Sansal\u2019s comments about the country\u2019s borders as a provocation and an affront to their patriotism.",
      "French officials have urged Algeria to release him, with President Emmanuel Macron appealing directly to Tebboune to pardon Sansal during a March phone call, citing the writer\u2019s age and failing health as reason for mercy.",

      "Three senior leaders at the English hospital where nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering babies have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter",
      "LONDON -- Three senior leaders at the English hospital where nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering seven babies and trying to kill seven others were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, police said Tuesday.",
      "The unnamed suspects being investigated for gross negligence manslaughter were arrested after a corporate manslaughter probe was expanded following Letby\u2019s 2023 convictions for the infant deaths at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England, said Detective Superintendent Paul Hughes of the Cheshire Constabulary. The three were released on bail.",
      "\u201cThis focuses on senior leadership and their decision-making to determine whether any criminality has taken place concerning the response to the increased levels of fatalities,\u201d Hughes said.",
      "Letby, 35, is serving multiple life sentences after being convicted of seven counts of murder and attempting to murder seven other infants between June 2015 and June 2016 while working as a neonatal nurse at the hospital.",
      "Prosecutors said she harmed babies in ways that left little trace, including injecting air into their bloodstreams, administering air or milk into their stomachs through nasogastric tubes, poisoning them with insulin and interfering with breathing tubes.",
      "Letby, who testified that she never harmed a child, has continued to proclaim her innocence and support for her has grown as legal and scientific experts have questioned the circumstantial and statistical evidence used at her trial. A panel of international medical experts disputed the evidence against her and her lawyer said she was wrongly convicted.",
      "A judge who oversaw a public inquiry seeking accountability of staff and management at the hospital is expected to publish her findings this fall. Justice Kathryn Thirlwall said at the outset of the inquiry that she would not review Letby's conviction, but take a deeper look into how failures led babies to repeatedly be harmed at the hospital.",
      "As that inquiry was underway earlier this year, an independent panel of more than a dozen medical experts issued a report that found no sign of a crime and concluded natural causes or bad medical care led to the demise of each of the newborns.",
      "\u201cIn summary, then, ladies and gentlemen, we did not find any murders,\u201d Dr. Shoo Lee, a retired neonatologist from Canada, said at a London news conference in February.",
      "Letby's lawyers and three former executives at the hospital unsuccessfully petitioned Thirlwall to halt the public inquiry after the medical panel released its findings. They argued that if the convictions are overturned, the inquiry might reach the wrong conclusions and waste more than 10 million pounds ($13.8 million) in taxpayer funds.",
      "Letby, who lost two bids to appeal her convictions, now has her case before the Criminal Case Review Commission, which reviews possible miscarriages of justice and could lead to one another shot at an appeal.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service has said two juries convicted Letby and three appellate judges had rejected her arguments that the prosecution expert evidence was flawed.",
      "While the medical panel said there was no evidence Letby intentionally harmed any babies, they did find that medical workers at the hospital were not properly skilled in resuscitation and inserting breathing tubes, lacked an understanding of some basic procedures, misdiagnosed ailments and acted slowly in treating acutely ill babies.",

      "Both sides in the more than three-year war following Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of its neighbor have raced to improve drone technology and enhance their use on the battlefield. They have deployed increasingly sophisticated and deadlier drones, turning the war into a testing ground for the new weaponry.",
      "Ukraine is under severe strain from a Russian push at places on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, but analysts say its defenses are largely holding firm. With recent direct peace talks delivering no progress on U.S.-led international efforts to halt the fighting, Russia and Ukraine are bulking up their arsenals.",
      "Russia last month launched 5,438 drones at Ukraine, a new monthly record, according to official data collated by The Associated Press.",
      "Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone hit an industrial plant in Izhevsk, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of Moscow, injuring several people and starting a fire, Alexander Brechalov, head of the Udmurtia region, said. The plant\u2019s workers were evacuated, he said.",
      "The drone struck the Kupol Electromechanical Plant, which produces air defense systems and drones for the Russian military, according to an official with Ukraine\u2019s Security Service, the SBU.",
      "At least two direct hits were recorded on the plant\u2019s buildings, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Ukraine has for months been using domestically produced long-range drones to strike plants, storage sites and logistical hubs deep inside Russian territory. In May last year, a Ukrainian drone hit an early-warning radar in the Russian city of Orsk, some 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) from the Ukrainian border, Kyiv officials claimed.",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine\u2019s domestic production of drones is about to increase in response to Russia\u2019s expanded barrages.",
      "\u201cThe priority is drones, interceptor drones and long-range strike drones,\u201d he said on Telegram late Monday.",
      "\u201cThis is extremely important,\u201d he added. \u201cRussia is investing in its unmanned capabilities, Russia is planning to increase the number of drones used in strikes against our state. We are preparing our countermeasures.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said that 60 Ukrainian drones were downed overnight over several regions, including 17 over Crimea, 16 over the Rostov region and four over the Saratov region.",
      "At the same time, four Russian Shahed drones struck the southern Ukraine city of Zaporizhzia during the night, leaving more than 1,600 households without power, according to authorities.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force said Tuesday that Russia fired 52 Shahed and decoy drones at the country overnight.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, rebuked Russia for continuing to strike civilian areas of Ukraine while effectively rejecting a ceasefire and dragging its feet on a peace settlement.",
      "\u201cWe urge an immediate ceasefire and a move to trilateral talks to end the war,\u201d Kellogg said on the social platform X late Monday. \u201cRussia cannot continue to stall for time while it bombs civilian targets in Ukraine.\u201d",

      "A court\u2019s suspension of Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has raised questions about whether her family\u2019s political comeback will end with another downfall",
      "BANGKOK -- The Constitutional Court's suspension of Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has raised questions about whether her family's political comeback last year would end with another downfall.",
      "Paetongtarn was the third prime minister in her family, after her father, Thaksin Shinawatra, a telecom billionaire who has been one of Thailand's top political operators, and her aunt, Yingluck Shinawatra, who was the country's first female prime minister. Thaksin was ousted by a military coup in 2006 and Yingluck by a court ruling in 2014.",
      "Thaksin remained beloved after his ouster among voters who saw in him and his allies a government that looked after their interests. While campaigning in 2022, Paetongtarn acknowledged her family ties but insisted she was not her father\u2019s proxy. \u201cIt\u2019s not the shadow of my dad. I am my dad\u2019s daughter, always and forever, but I have my own decisions,\u201d she said.",
      "She also said she hoped her government would be able to \u201cbuild opportunity and quality of life\u201d and \u201cmake the country go forward.\u201d",
      "Paetongtarn was suspended Tuesday by the court pending an ethics investigation a leaked phone call with senior Cambodian leader Hun Sen that was perceived as damaging to Thailand's interests and image.",
      "Her critics have said Paetongtarn's government has achieved little. Marriage equality became law but was initiated under her predecessor. Controls on cannabis were retightened after public backlash over decriminalization, but the move and its enforcement were called rushed and confusing.",
      "Her critics also cited unsatisfactory outcomes in other Pheu Thai party policies, like unequal minimum wage increases, constant changes in a cash handout program and the stalled and controversial legalization of casinos. They also noted the lack of progress in tariffs talks with the United States.",
      "But analysts see the leaked call following border tensions with Cambodia to be the most disastrous event by far.",
      "The outrage has centered on Paetongtarn\u2019s comments about an outspoken Thai army commander and the perception that she was trying to appease Hun Sen.",
      "Paetongtarn apologized but also denied that she had damaged the country. She ignored calls for her to resign or dissolve Parliament to take responsibility, which critics saw as an attempt by the Pheu Thai party to cling to power.",
      "Napon Jatusripitak, a political science researcher at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said her response seemed \u201ctotally disconnected from political reality\u201d and that the scandal has exposed \u201cher leadership failures and fuels accusations that she prioritizes family interests over national welfare.\u201d",
      "Her father, Thaksin, is believed to be the key decision maker behind Pheu Thai, now led by Paetongtarn. Time and again, Thaksin-backed parties have prevailed in national elections but could not stay in office after legal rulings and destabilizing street protests engineered by Thaksin\u2019s die-hard foes.",
      "But in 2023, Thaksin alienated many of his old supporters with what looked like a self-serving deal with his former conservative opponents. It allowed his return from exile and his party to form the new government, while sidelining the progressive Move Forward Party, which finished first in a national election but was seen by the conservative establishment as a greater threat.",
      "Now with the current crisis, things could drastically change for the Shinawatra family.",
      "\u201cIn light of the recent controversy, the Shinawatra spell has been broken. The only viable Shinawatra scion is now tainted,\u201d Napon said. \u201cIt would be an understatement to say that the Shinawatra name no longer guarantees electoral success.\u201d",
      "And not everything has been squared away with her family\u2019s enemies. Yingluck remains in exile, and legal problems \u2014 arguably politically inspired \u2014 could send her to prison if she returns to Thailand. Thaksin also still faces some legal challenges.",
      "Thailand\u2019s royalist establishment has long been disturbed that Thaksin\u2019s populist policies appeared to threaten their status and that of the monarchy at the heart of Thai identity.",
      "Paetongtarn now also faces protests by familiar faces from the same conservative, pro-royalist group that opposed her father.",
      "\u201cHistory seems to be repeating itself in a way. Thailand seems trapped in a depressingly familiar cycle where Shinawatra-led governments come to power, only to face mounting pressure from traditional power centers, street protests, and extraparliamentary interventions that ultimately force them from office,\u201d Napon said.",
      "Paetongtarn, 38, is the youngest of Thaksin\u2019s three children. She was an executive in a hotel business run by her family before making her public entry into politics in 2021 when the Pheu Thai party named her to lead an advisory committee.",
      "She has two children with her husband, Pitaka Suksawat, who was a commercial pilot before he began working in one of the Shinawatras\u2019 real estate ventures.",

      "The fire department recovered the charred bodies of 34 workers from the accident site in an industrial area about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the state capital Hyderabad, the state\u2019s fire services director G.V. Narayana Rao told The Associated Press.",

      "Nearly three dozen injured workers were admitted to hospitals, he said.",
      "\u201cThe whole structure of the factory has collapsed. Fire has been doused, and we hope to finish removing the debris in the next few hours,\u201d Rao said.",
      "The explosion and subsequent fire was reported on Monday in the factory\u2019s spray dryer unit, which is used to process raw material into fine powder for making drugs, Rao said.",
      "The state\u2019s Health Minister Damodar Raja Narasimha said there were 108 workers inside the factory at the time of the explosion.",

      "BANGKOK -- Thailand's Constitutional Court suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday, pending an ethics investigation over accusations she was too deferential to a senior Cambodian leader when the two discussed a recent border dispute in a phone call that was leaked.",
      "Paetongtarn has faced growing dissatisfaction over her handling of the dispute, which involved an armed confrontation on May 28 in which one Cambodian soldier was killed. In a call with Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen, she attempted to defuse tensions \u2014 but instead set off a string of complaints and public protests by critics who accused her of being too fawning.",
      "Paetongtarn\u2019s suspension raises the possibility of renewed instability in Thailand, a still fragile democracy that has suffered several similar bouts of uncertainty. At the root of much of that were concerns from the conservative establishment, including the military, that the political dynasty started by Paetongtarn\u2019s father, the popular but divisive former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was growing too powerful.",
      "She is the third member of her family to hold the prime minister\u2019s office \u2014 and the third to face the possibility of removal before her term ended. Thaksin was removed from office in a 2006 coup and driven into exile, while his sister, and his sister, former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawtra, was removed by a court order in 2014, followed shortly after by a coup.",
      "The suspension also comes at a time when the country is facing an economic slowdown and growing discontent with Paetongtarn and her Pheu Thai party, in general, with critics saying her government\u2019s performance has been underwhelming.",
      "The judges voted unanimously Tuesday to take the petition accusing her of a breach of the ethics, and voted 7-2 to immediately suspend her from duty as a prime minister until the ruling is given. The court gave Paetongtarn 15 days to give evidence to support her case.",
      "After the court order, Paetongtarn said she would accept the process and defended her actions.",
      "\u201cI only thought about what to do to avoid troubles, what to do to avoid armed confrontation, for the soldiers not to suffer any loss. I wouldn't be able to accept it if I said something with the other leader that could lead to negative consequences,\u201d she said.",
      "She also apologized to people upset over the leaked call and left the Government House shortly after.",
      "Suriya Jungrungruangkit, who is a deputy prime minister and a transport minister, will take charge as the acting prime minister, said Chousak Sirinil, minister of the prime minister's office.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, before the court suspended Paetongtarn, King Maha Vajiralongkorn had endorsed a Cabinet reshuffle after a major party left the government coalition over the leaked call.",
      "In the reshuffle, Paetongtarn also received the position of culture minister, in addition to prime minister, though it\u2019s not clear if she can take the oath to take up that role.",
      "In the call that about the border tensions, Paetongtarn could be heard addressing Hun Sen \u2014 a longtime friend of her father \u2014 as uncle. She also urged him not to listen to a Thai regional army commander who had publicly criticized Cambodia about the border dispute, and called him \u201can opponent.\u201d",
      "Thousands of conservative, nationalist-leaning protesters rallied in central Bangkok on Saturday to demand Paetongtarn\u2019s resignation.",
      "Paetongtarn also faces separate investigations by another agency over the leaked call \u2014 a case that could also lead to her removal.",
      "The Constitutional Court last year removed Paetongtarn's predecessor over a breach of ethics. Thailand\u2019s courts, especially the Constitutional Court, are viewed as a defender of the royalist establishment, which has used them and nominally independent agencies such as the Election Commission to cripple or sink political opponents.",
      "Paetongtarn, 38, is the youngest daughter of Thaksin. Her father has remained beloved by many of the Thailand's poor and working classes who long saw him as their champion.",
      "But the family's political fortunes now may be on the wane. Thaksin alienated many of his supporters with what looked like a self-serving deal with his former conservative opponents. It allowed his return from exile in 2023 and the party he supported to form the new government, while sidelining the progressive Move Forward Party, which finished first in a national election but was seen by the conservative establishment as a greater threat.",
      "Thaksin has faced several legal challenges since his return. On Tuesday, he attended a court hearing in a case alleging he defamed the monarchy in 2015.",
      "He also is under investigation over the handling of his return to face an eight-year prison term on charges related to corruption and abuse of power. At the time, he was transferred almost immediately to a hospital and later granted clemency because of his age and health without spending a single night in jail.",
      "The complaints argue he avoided properly serving his sentence and raise the possibility Thaksin could be forced to serve prison time.",

      "The regional court in Braunschweig on Tuesday cited an unspecified health issue that meant Winterkorn, 78, was not in a condition to face trial.",
      "The court said in a statement that it had \"provisionally terminated\u201d the proceedings. It said the health issue represented a \u201ctemporary impediment\u201d and would continue to be reviewed with the help of an expert so that proceedings could resume if Winterkorn recovers.",

      "Lululemon has filed a lawsuit against Costco that accuses the wholesale club operator of selling lower-priced duplicates of some of its popular athleisure clothing.",
      "Lululemon Athletica claims in its lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that Costco has \u201cunlawfully traded\u201d on its reputation, goodwill and sweat equity by selling unauthorized and unlicensed apparel that uses knockoff, infringing versions of its patents.",
      "Lululemon alleges that Costco is known to use manufacturers of popular branded products for its private label Kirkland brand, but that the company and the manufacturers don't tell consumers of the connection between them for many of the Kirkland-branded products. Because of this, Lululemon claims this leads at least some shoppers to believe that Kirkland-branded products are made by the authentic supplier of the \u201coriginal\u201d products. Lululemon claims Costco doesn't try to dispel the ambiguity.",

      "Lulemon was in a similar legal dispute with Peloton in 2021. Two years later the companies announced a five-year partnership that included Lululemon becoming the primary athletic apparel partner to Peloton.",

      "The mineral-rich Arctic island is open for tourism. Whale-watching tours, excursions to the iconic puffin island and guided charters through remote settlements are just the beginning of what Greenland has to offer visitors. Locals want to show what makes the island unique beyond a recent diplomatic dustup with U.S. President Donald Trump.",

      "Perched in a wind-carved valley in Nepal's Upper Mustang, more than 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) above sea level, the Buddhist village lived by slow, deliberate rhythms \u2014 herding yaks and sheep and harvesting barley under sheer ochre cliffs honeycombed with \u201csky caves\u201d \u2014 2,000-year-old chambers used for ancestral burials, meditation and shelter.",
      "Then the water dried up. Snow-capped mountains turned brown and barren as, year after year, snowfall declined. Springs and canals vanished and when it did rain, the water came all at once, flooding fields and melting away the mud homes. Families left one by one, leaving the skeletal remains of a community transformed by climate change: crumbling mud homes, cracked terraces and unkempt shrines.",
      "The Hindu Kush and Himalayan mountain regions \u2014 stretching from Afghanistan to Myanmar \u2014 hold more ice than anywhere else outside the Arctic and Antarctic. Their glaciers feed major rivers that support 240 million people in the mountains \u2014 and 1.65 billion more downstream.",
      "Such high-altitude areas are warming faster than lowlands. Glaciers are retreating and permafrost areas are thawing as snowfall becomes scarcer and more erratic, according to the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development or ICMOD.",

      "\u201cWe moved because there was no water. We need water to drink and to farm. But there is none there. Three streams, and all three dried up,\u201d said Gurung, 54.",
      "Climate change is quietly reshaping where people can live and work by disrupting farming, water access, and weather patterns, said Neil Adger, a professor of human geography at the University of Exeter. In places like Mustang, that's making life harder, even if people don\u2019t always say climate change is why they moved. \u201cOn the everyday basis, the changing weather patterns ... it's actually affecting the ability of people to live in particular places,\u201d Adger said.",
      "Around the globe, extreme weather due to climate change is forcing communities to move, whether it's powerful tropical storms in The Philippines and Honduras, drought in Somalia or forest fires in California.",
      "In the world's highest mountains, Samjung isn't the only community to have to start over, said Amina Maharjan, a migration specialist at ICMOD. Some villages move only short distances, but inevitably the key driver is lack of water.",
      "\"The water scarcity is getting chronic,\u201d she said.",
      "Retreating glaciers \u2014 rivers of ice shrinking back as the world warms \u2014 are the most tangible and direct evidence of climate change. Up to 80% of the glacier volume in the Hindu Kush and Himalayas could vanish in this century if greenhouse gas emissions aren\u2019t drastically cut, a 2023 report warned.",
      "It hasn't snowed in Upper Mustang for nearly three years, a dire blow for those living and farming in high-altitude villages. Snowfall traditionally sets the seasonal calendar, determining when crops of barley, buckwheat, and potatoes are planted and affecting the health of grazing livestock.",
      "\u201cIt is critically important,\" Maharjan said.",
      "For Samjung, the drought and mounting losses began around the turn of the century. Traditional mud homes built for a dry, cold mountain climate fell apart as monsoon rains grew more intense \u2014 a shift scientists link to climate change. The region's steep slopes and narrow valleys funnel water into flash floods that destroyed homes and farmland, triggering a wave of migration that began a decade ago.",
      "Moving a village \u2014 even one with fewer than 100 residents like Samjung \u2014 was no simple endeavor. They needed reliable access to water and nearby communities for support during disasters. Relocating closer to winding mountain roads would allow villagers to market their crops and benefit from growing tourism. Eventually, the king of Mustang, who still owns large tracts of land in the area nearly two decades after Nepal abolished its monarchy, provided suitable land for a new village.",
      "Pemba Gurung, 18, and her sister Toshi Lama Gurung, 22, don\u2019t remember much about the move from their old village. But they remember how hard it was to start over. Families spent years gathering materials to build new mud homes with bright tin roofs on the banks of the glacial Kali Gandaki river, nearly 15 kilometers (9 miles) away. They constructed shelters for livestock and canals to bring water to their homes. Only then could they move.",
      "Some villagers still herd sheep and yak, but life is a bit different in New Samjung, which is close to Lo Manthang, a medieval walled city cut off from the world until 1992, when foreigners were first allowed to visit. It's a hub for pilgrims and tourists who want to trek in the high mountains and explore its ancient Buddhist culture, so some villagers work in tourism.",

      "The ruling \u2014 a dramatic effort to enforce a $16 billion U.S. court judgement against Argentina \u2014 presents a new headache for libertarian President Javier Milei, the ideological foil for left-wing former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner who oversaw Argentina's contentious takeover of YPF and ensuing legal battles during her tenure (2007-2015). Milei vowed to appeal the ruling.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez's abrupt move to seize control of YPF at the time helped bring serial defaulter Argentina further infamy for abandoning its global financial obligations. Milei inherited an economy in shambles after decades of reckless state spending and campaigned on pledges to privatize state companies.",
      "In granting the request of former shareholders largely represented by Burford Capital, which finances litigation in return for a share of the winnings, Judge Loretta Preska of the Southern District of New York gave Argentina two weeks to transfer its shares in YPF to Bank of New York Mellon Corp, the major U.S. custody bank, according to the ruling seen by The Associated Press.",
      "Because YPF is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the plaintiffs could file the lawsuit in a U.S. district court. Shares of YPF closed down 5.6%.",
      "The judgement stems from a long-running legal case that in 2023 saw Judge Preska find Argentina liable for $16.1 billion in damages and interest. The plaintiffs argue that the government should have launched a tender offer for stakes held by minority shareholders.",
      "Milei, whose government has struggled to build up depleted foreign reserves, has vowed to appeal the ruling \u201cto defend national interests\" and blamed the problem on his political rivals.",
      "\u201cMore than 10 years have passed, and we Argentines continue to suffer the consequences of the worst government in Argentine history,\u201d he wrote on social media platform X.",
      "Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, Director for the Americas at the New York-based Horizon Engage risk consultancy, said the ruling was \u201ca reminder for the Milei administration that the country\u2019s problems will not go away just because he blames the opposition for them.\u201d",
      "\u201cControl of YPF is important for Milei; that\u2019s why an appeal is the only option for him,\u201d he added.",
      "Paying up and losing the controlling stake in YPF \u2014 which has become a pillar of the economy \u2014 would cripple Argentina at a crucial moment for Milei's government.",
      "YPF has accelerated its drive to develop the country's huge reserves of shale gas in the Vaca Muerta field in Argentine Patagonia. Crude production at Vaca Muerta has steadily climbed, hitting record production in May at 448,000 barrels per day, 22.5% more than the same month in 2024, according to official data.",
      "In 2024, YPF notched a net profit of almost $2.4 billion, up from a $1.3 billion loss the year before.",
      "Milei has hoped to leverage investments in the Vaca Muerta field to cure the nation's long-standing fiscal weakness and pay its massive deficits.",

      "At some 940 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans are inching closer to getting their tax and spending cut bill through Congress with a final Senate vote likely late Monday or early Tuesday.",
      "At some 940 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. President Donald Trump has admonished Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.",
      "Democrats are united against the legislation and were offering scores of amendments to alter it Monday as the Senate slogged through what is known as a vote-a-rama. Senators can offer an unlimited number of amendments, with each receiving a vote. Once the bill clears the Senate, it would have to pass the House before Trump can sign it into law.",
      "Here's the latest on what's in the bill. There could be changes as GOP lawmakers continue to negotiate.",
      "Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay, the ability to deduct interest payments for some automotive loans, along with a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.",
      "It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.",
      "A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.",
      "There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research.",
      "The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.",
      "Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.",
      "The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.",
      "The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions.",
      "To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.",
      "For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.",
      "To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for the poor.",
      "Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.",
      "The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program\u2019s work requirements.",
      "There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.",
      "More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.",
      "The Senate proposes a $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Program to help offset reduced Medicaid dollars. It's a new addition, intended to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that the proposed Medicaid provider tax cuts would hurt rural hospitals.",
      "Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden's 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering healthcare costs.",
      "Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a \u201cdeath sentence for America\u2019s wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.\u201d",
      "Under the bill, a tax credit that subsidizes the production of electricity would be eliminated for any wind and solar plant not plugged into the grid by the end of 2027. But Republicans aren't just looking to roll back the tax breaks Biden put into place: they're also looking to add a tax for new wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.",
      "A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.",
      "Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.",
      "A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.",
      "The House and Senate both have a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump\u2019s long-sought \u201cNational Garden of American Heroes.\u201d",
      "There's a new excise tax on university endowments. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.",
      "Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.",
      "Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for exploration to Mars.",
      "The bill would deter states from regulating artificial intelligence by linking certain federal AI infrastructure money to maintaining a freeze. Seventeen Republican governors have asked GOP leaders to drop the provision.",
      "Additionally, a provision would increase the nation's debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.",
      "Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.",
      "Or not, depending on how one does the math.",
      "Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already \u201ccurrent policy.\u201d Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.",
      "Under the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost a half-trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said.",
      "Democrats say this is \u201cmagic math\u201d that obscures the true costs of the tax breaks. Some nonpartisan groups worried about the country's fiscal trajectory are siding with Democrats in that take. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans are employing an \u201caccounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.\u201d",

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The head of the European Central Bank said inflation has become more unpredictable due to shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2014 and that policymakers need to take the possibility of such extreme scenarios into account and communicate them to the public as well.",
      "\u201cThe world ahead is more uncertain, and that uncertainty is likely to make inflation more volatile,\u201d ECB President Christine Lagarde said Monday in a speech opening the central bank's annual conference in Sintra, Portugal. \u201cIt's pretty basic but that's the reality.\u201d",
      "One reason, she said, was that increasingly regular supply disruptions were leading companies to change their prices more frequently, a habit that goes beyond the recent burst of inflation in the U.S. and Europe and \u201creflects a structural shift in how firms operate under conditions of permanently higher uncertainty.\"",
      "The bank's assessment of the economy needs to rely on taking extreme possible scenarios into account as well as the more likely baseline predictions, and it should let the public in on those possible outcomes as well, she said. Lagarde in particular cited the inflation spike that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where a baseline scenario based on higher energy prices suggest inflation for 2022 of 5.5% - but a worst-case scenario indicated more than 7% inflation, much closer to the final figure of 8%.",
      "Another example was the pandemic, where spending by homebound consumers shifted from services like restaurants to goods such as home exercise equipment.",
      "\u201cScenario analysis could have helped in illustrating that the range of possible inflation outcomes was unusually wide \u2013 and would have reduced the risk of projecting false certainty to the public,\u201d Lagarde said.",
      "The bank's strategy review announced Monday reaffirmed its target of 2% for inflation, a goal it has met for the time being as annual price increases were 1.9% in May. The drop in inflation has let the bank cut its benchmark interest rate from a peak of 4% to 2%.",
      "Threats of higher tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have added to uncertainty about the outlook for growth and inflation. The European Commission and US negotiators are trying to reach agreement on a trade deal ahead of a July 9 deadline.",
      "The conference in Sintra is the ECB's equivalent of the U.S. Federal Reserve gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and gathers top central bankers and economists from around the world. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is to take part in a panel on Tuesday with Lagarde, Bank of England Government Andrew Bailey, Bank of Korea Governor Chang Yong Rhee and Kazuo Ueda, the governor of the Bank of Japan.",

      "IV therapy clinics are springing up around the country, touting quick ways to recover from a hangover or a hard workout",
      "IV therapy clinics are springing up around the country, touting quick ways to recover from a hangover or a hard workout. But doctors and regulators preach caution.",
      "The services have been on a growth spurt since the COVID-19 pandemic, offering drips that promise to boost energy, gird immune systems or relieve joint pain. This is done from bags of intravenous fluids normally seen hanging next to hospital beds.",
      "Customers must be willing to fork over as much as couple hundred dollars for each session \u2014 in some cases for a mixture of vitamins and supplements that would be considerably cheaper in pill form.",
      "Proponents say this approach helps customers hydrate faster and absorb more of a vitamin or supplement than they would by swallowing pills.",
      "But Dr. Sam Torbati, co-chair of emergency medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, says the therapy mostly helps people create \u201cexpensive urine,\u201d with the body clearing what it doesn't use.",
      "They\u2019re hard to count, partly because some businesses just provide IV therapy while others offer it as part of a medical spa.",
      "The practice grew popular during COVID-19, when access to doctors became limited and people grew more concerned about their immune system health, according to the American IV Association, an industry group.",
      "Regulators in Ohio are following the trend closely in their state, which now has around 200 clinics. These businesses were largely unheard of there before the pandemic, said Cameron McNamee, a spokesman for the Ohio Board of Pharmacy.",
      "Doctors say there are some good questions to pose before any treatment starts.",
      "Customers should ask the person starting the IV how long they have been doing their job and what sort of training they have, said Torbati.",
      "They also should know what\u2019s in the IV drip. For instance, \u201cWonder Juice\u201d treatment offered by the Restore Hyper Wellness franchise combines six vitamins and supplements that are available, in oral form, on the pharmacy store shelves.",
      "Knowing all the ingredients comes in handy if someone has an allergic reaction.",
      "Also ask where the company gets its drugs, if any are used. The answer should be a licensed pharmaceutical wholesaler, according to McNamee.",
      "Otherwise, the drug could be counterfeit or substandard. Ohio regulators have suspended the licenses of businesses that purchased drugs on Facebook.",
      "Customers also should make sure the clinic is in decent shape when they visit.",
      "\u201cIf the office isn\u2019t clean, then the IV room\u2019s probably not clean either,\u201d McNamee said.",
      "They don\u2019t like that a nurse or a paramedic often helps a customer decide on an IV therapy and then delivers the treatment. Rules can vary, but many state regulators say a doctor, physician assistant or nurse practitioner should be involved.",
      "The clinics often run on standing orders, which are issued by a doctor with the idea that they give the nurse or paramedic permission to treat patients according to certain protocols.",
      "Hospital emergency rooms regularly operate on the same kind of orders, according to Dr. Chris Seitz, an emergency physician and chairman of the American IV Association's scientific advisory board.",
      "\u201cMany nurses saw patients before I ever could get to them in the emergency department and initiated care like IV fluids,\u201d he said.",
      "Regulators also worry about the role customers play in picking their own treatments.",
      "\u201cA patient cannot enter a doctor\u2019s office or hospital and demand an IV any more than a patient can direct his or her own appendectomy,\u201d Kentucky officials said in a March statement.",
      "But Seitz says there should be a partnership between any care provider and the patient, with the provider helping the patient make the right decision.",
      "\u201cPatients have a requirement and a need to be the CEO of their own health,\u201d he said.",
      "Patient choice feeds another worry: the mixing of ingredients for specific treatments, a practice known as compounding.",
      "South Carolina regulators said in a 2023 statement that this should result from a valid care provider order, \u201cnot from a patient-driven menu akin to a fast-food restaurant.\u201d",
      "However, proponents say the addition of vitamins or drugs to an IV treatment should not be confused with mixing prescription drugs in a lab.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just pretty simple low-hanging fruit in terms of clinical complexity,\u201d said Jeff Cohen, a co-founder of the American IV Association.",
      "IV therapy clinics do provide some care. They can help cancer patients or pregnant women stay hydrated. Some treatments offer relief from migraine pain.",
      "But many drips require the creation of a sterile, soluble vitamin or supplement that is safe to put into someone's veins. That's more expensive to make than a vitamin that may cost a few cents a pill, Torbati noted.",

    "story": [
      "A Republican plan heading to a vote in the Senate would quickly end incentives for clean energy and impose new taxes on some wind and solar projects, while boosting production of coal used to make steel",
      "WASHINGTON -- Clean energy advocates were already bracing for a Republican-led bill that would phase out tax credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy as President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under former President Joe Biden.",
      "But a proposal that emerged over the weekend was even more drastic than they thought.",
      "It was more aggressive in ending incentives for clean energy than a previous Senate version and would even impose new taxes on some wind and solar projects while boosting production of coal used in steelmaking. The Senate was moving Monday to approve Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts even as Democrats lined up to challenge it.",
      "The GOP plan is \u201ca death sentence for America\u2019s wind and solar industries\u201d that will lead to a spike in Americans\u2019 utility bills and jeopardize hundreds of renewable energy projects slated to boost the nation's electric grid, said Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "\u201cTheir plan started out as a phase-down of the tax credits I wrote for wind and solar\u201d in the 2022 climate law, Wyden said. \u201cBut now they\u2019re proposing an outright massacre with punishing new taxes on these industries that happen to be the cheapest and easiest ways to get new energy on the grid.\"",
      "Republicans said the tax-cut bill represents historic savings for taxpayers and supports production of traditional fossil-fuel energy sources such as oil, natural gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.",
      "\u201cTo achieve this record level of savings, we are slashing Biden\u2019s Green New Deal spending and promoting America-First energy,'' Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo, chairman of the Senate Finance panel and a lead architect of the bill, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe stop penalizing fossil fuels in favor of unreliable and expensive green energy, and instead support consistent energy sources, making energy affordable again.\u201d Crapo said.",
      "The Senate bill eliminates \u201chundreds of billions of dollars of the Green New Deal subsidies, including ending wasteful credits like the EV tax credit,\u201d he added, referring to a Democratic measure included the climate law to provide incentives for electric vehicles that don't emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.",
      "Some moderate senators, such as Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, were seeking to strip the new tax on wind and solar and make other other changes, but it was unclear whether those proposals would advance.",
      "If approved unchanged, the measure will kill investment in renewable energy and jeopardize hundreds of gigawatts of new power supply that would otherwise help the U.S. meet rapidly rising electricity demand as data centers, artificial intelligence and other growing uses strain the power grid, environmental advocates said.",
      "The GOP plan would \"lock in higher household energy bills, kill American jobs ... and torch our future,'' said Mattea Mrkusic, who leads energy policy for the environmental group Evergreen Action.",
      "The bill would cut off climate law credits for projects that aren\u2019t \u201cplaced in service\u201d \u2014 that is, plugged into the grid \u2014 by the end of 2028. That timeline is more aggressive than previous proposals and virtually impossible for most projects to meet, advocates said.",
      "The legislation also blocks credits for companies using components from adversaries such as China and adds a new tax on wind and solar projects that don\u2019t follow certain supply chain rules.",
      "Princeton University Professor Jesse D. Jenkins said he was surprised at the Senate bill's speed in ending wind and solar incentives and shocked at the proposed tax credit for metallurgical coal, a highly polluting form of coal that is used in steel-making and often exported to countries like India and Brazil.",
      "\u201cThis bill kills the industries of the future while subsidizing the industries of the 19th century. It\u2019s insanity!\u201d Jenkins said in a post on social media.",
      "If passed as proposed, the bill lead to higher energy prices, fewer jobs, less investment in American energy production and less confidence in the American business environment, Jenkins said.",
      "Tom Pyle, president of the conservative American Energy Alliance, called the Senate bill a move in the right direction.",
      "\u201cIf, as supporters of the Inflation Reduction Act are complaining, repealing these subsidies will \u2018kill\u2019 their industry, then maybe it shouldn\u2019t exist in the first place,\" Pyle said, referring to the 2022 climate law.",
      "\u201cExtending green giveaways on the backs of American taxpayers is shortsighted and neglectful,\" Pyle said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Congress to deliver both energy reliability and the largest tax cut in history to President Trump and the American people.\u201d",
      "Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, called the Senate bill a \u201cmidnight dumping\u201d and said it would punish the fastest-growing sectors of the U.S. energy industry.",
      "\u201cIt is astounding that the Senate would intentionally raise prices on consumers rather than encouraging economic growth and addressing the affordability crisis facing American households,\" Grumet said. The bill would \u201cstrand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments\u201d and land hardest on rural communities that would benefit the most from clean energy investment, he said.",

      "\u201cMake no mistake: If this bill passes, Americans will pay the price \u2014 literally,\" Hopper said. \"Power bills will rise. Factory jobs will vanish. Families will be forced to spend more just to keep the lights on and their homes cool. All while we become more dependent on foreign energy and more vulnerable to blackouts.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday ending many U.S. economic sanctions on Syria, following through on a promise he made to the country's new interim leader.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the move was designed to \u201cpromote and support the country's path to stability and peace.\u201d",
      "The executive order is meant to \u201cend the country\u2019s isolation from the international financial system, setting the stage for global commerce and galvanizing investments from its neighbors in the region, as well as from the United States,\u201d Treasury\u2019s acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Brad Smith, told reporters on a call Monday to preview the administration\u2019s action.",
      "Monday\u2019s actions do not rescind sanctions imposed on ousted former President Bashar Assad, his top aides, family members and officials who had been determined to have committed human rights abuses or been involved in drug trafficking or part of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program.",
      "It also leaves intact a major set of sanctions passed by Congress targeting anyone doing business with or offering support to Syria\u2019s military, intelligence or other suspect institutions. While the Trump administration has passed temporary waivers on those sanctions, known as the Caesar Act, they can only be permanently repealed by law.",
      "The White House posted the text of the order on X after the signing, which was not open to the press.",
      "The U.S. granted Syria sweeping exemptions from sanctions in May, which was a first step toward fulfilling the Republican president\u2019s pledge to lift a half-century of penalties on a country shattered by 13 years of civil war.",
      "Along with the lifting of economic sanctions, Monday\u2019s executive order lifts the national emergency outlined in an executive order issued by former President George W. Bush in response to Syria\u2019s occupation of Lebanon and pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, Treasury officials said. Five other previous executive orders related to Syria were also lifted.",
      "Sanctions targeting terrorist groups and manufacturers and sellers of the amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon will remain in place.",

      "\u201cThis is another promise made and promise kept,\u201d Leavitt said Monday.",
      "The European Union has also followed through with lifting nearly all remaining sanctions on Syria.",
      "Still, some restrictions remain in place. The U.S. still designates Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism and the group led by al-Sharaa as a foreign terrorist organization.",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court has decided to review whether Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's lawsuit seeking to shut down part of an aging pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac belongs in state or federal court",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The U.S. Supreme Court announced Monday it will review whether Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's lawsuit seeking to shut down a section of an aging pipeline beneath a Great Lakes channel belongs in state court.",
      "Nessel sued in state court in June 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows the Enbridge energy company to operate a 4.5-mile (6.4-kilometer) section of pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac, which link Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.",
      "She won a restraining order shutting down the pipeline from Ingham County Judge James Jamo in June 2020, although Enbridge was allowed to continue operations after meeting safety requirements.",
      "The company moved the lawsuit into federal court in 2021, arguing it affects U.S. and Canadian trade. But a three-judge panel from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case back to Jamo in June 2024, finding that Enbridge missed a 30-day deadline to change jurisdictions.",
      "On Monday, the Supreme Court did not explain its rationale for taking up the matter.",
      "Enbridge officials said in a statement that they were encouraged by the Supreme Court's choice, noting that exceptions to the 30-day deadline exist.",
      "Nessel spokesperson Kimberly Bush said the lawsuit belongs in a Michigan court. The attorney general's lawyers have argued that the case invokes the public trust doctrine, a concept in state law holding that natural resources belong to the public.",
      "The pipeline at issue, Line 5, has moved crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Concerns over the section beneath the straits rupturing and causing a catastrophic spill have been growing since 2017, when Enbridge engineers revealed they had known about gaps in the section\u2019s protective coating since 2014. A boat anchor damaged the section in 2018, intensifying fears of a spill.",
      "The Michigan Department of Natural Resources under Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer revoked the straits easement for Line 5 in 2020. Enbridge has filed a separate federal lawsuit challenging the revocation.",
      "The company is seeking permits to encase the section of pipeline beneath the straits in a protective tunnel. The Michigan Public Service Commission granted the relevant permits in 2023, but Enbridge still needs approval from from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.",
      "The pipeline is at the center of a legal dispute in Wisconsin as well. A federal judge in Madison last summer gave Enbridge three years to shut down part of Line 5 that runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior\u2019s reservation. The company has proposed rerouting the pipeline around the reservation and has appealed the shutdown order to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate's long day of voting churned into a long Monday night, with Republican leaders grasping for ways to shore up support for President Donald Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts while fending off proposed amendments from Democrats who oppose the package and are trying to defeat it.",
      "The outcome was not yet in sight. Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota acknowledged the Republicans are \u201cfiguring out how to get to the end game.\u201d",
      "And House Speaker Mike Johnson signaled the potential problems the Senate package could face when it is eventually sent back to his chamber for a final round of voting, which was expected later this week, ahead of Trump's Fourth of July deadline.",
      "\u201cI have prevailed upon my Senate colleagues to please, please, please keep it as close to the House product as possible,\u201d said Johnson, the Louisiana Republican, as he left the Capitol around dinnertime. House Republicans had already passed their version last month.",
      "It's a pivotal moment for the Republicans, who have control of Congress and are racing to wrap up work with just days to go before Trump's holiday deadline Friday. The 940-page \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d as it\u2019s formally titled, has consumed Congress as its shared priority with the president.",

Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who warns people will lose access to Medicaid health care, and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who opposes raising the debt limit \u2014 have indicated opposition. Tillis abruptly announced over the weekend he would not seek reelection after Trump threatened to campaign against him.",
      "Attention quickly turned to key senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, who have also raised concerns about health care cuts, but also a loose coalition of four conservative GOP senators pushing for even steeper reductions.",

      "\u201cRepublicans are in shambles because they know the bill is so unpopular,\u201d Schumer said as he walked the halls. The Democrats have proposed dozens of amendments in what\u2019s called a vote-a-rama, though most were expected to fail.",
      "A new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law. The CBO said the package would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the decade.",

They have not said how they would vote for the final package.",
      "At the same time, conservative Senate Republicans \u2014 Rick Scott of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming \u2014 have proposed steeper health care cuts and filed into Thune's office for a near-midnight meeting.",
      "As the first few Senate amendments came up Monday \u2014 to strike parts of the bill that would limit Medicaid funds to rural hospitals or shift the costs of food stamp benefits to the states \u2014 some were winning support from a few Republicans, though none passed.",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, the GOP chairman of the Finance Committee, dismissed the dire predictions of health care cuts as Democrats trafficking in what he called the \u201cpolitics of fear.\u201d",
      "All told, the Senate bill includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, according to the latest CBO analysis, making permanent Trump's 2017 rates, which would expire at the end of the year if Congress fails to act, while adding the new ones he campaigned on, including no taxes on tips.",
      "The Senate package would roll back billions of dollars in green energy tax credits, which Democrats warn will wipe out wind and solar investments nationwide. It would impose $1.2 trillion in cuts, largely to Medicaid and food stamps, by imposing work requirements on able-bodied people, including some parents and older Americans, making sign-up eligibility more stringent and changing federal reimbursements to states.",
      "Additionally, the bill would provide a $350 billion infusion for border and national security, including for deportations, some of it paid for with new fees charged to immigrants.",
      "Unable to stop the march toward passage, the Democrats as the minority party in Congress are using the tools at their disposal to delay and drag out the process.",

      "After nearly four months of military training, the young soldier and the rest of her unit spent early June completing their final exercises near the Danish army\u2019s barracks in Hovelte, 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "Katrine and other female soldiers, all of whom spoke to The Associated Press on June 11 on the condition that only their first names be used because of operational security, volunteered for military service earlier this year. Until now, that was the only way women were allowed to partake in military service, although women have been able to enlist as full-time members of the armed forces since the early 1970s",
      "The Scandinavian country is seeking to increase the number of young people in the military by extending compulsory enlistment to women for the first time. Men and women can both still volunteer, and the remaining places will be filled by a gender-neutral draft lottery.",
      "\u201cIn the situation the world is in now, it\u2019s needed,\u201d Katrine said. \u201cI think it\u2019s only fair and right that women participate equally with men.\u201d",
      "Under new rules passed by Denmark\u2019s parliament earlier in June, Danish women who turn 18 after Tuesday will be entered into the lottery system, on an equal footing with their male compatriots. The change comes against a backdrop of Russian aggression and growing military investment across NATO countries.",
      "Even from the relative safety of Denmark, Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine casts its shadow. Lessons from the Ukrainian battlefields have even filtered down into their training.",
      "\u201cThat makes it very real,\u201d Katrine said.",
      "Denmark's gender-parity reforms were originally outlined in 2024 as part of a major defense agreement. The program was originally expected to be implemented by early 2027, but has been brought forward to summer 2025.",

Some people \u2014 both men and women \u2014 volunteer, and the rest of the places are filled by a lottery system that until now has only involved men. Women volunteers make up roughly a quarter of 2024\u2019s cohort.",

      "In February, Denmark\u2019s government announced plans to bolster its military by setting up a $7 billion fund that it said would raise the country\u2019s defense spending to more than 3% of gross domestic product this year. Parts of the conscript program are being financed by the so-called Acceleration Fund.",
      "\u201cWe see a sharpened security situation in Europe. We have the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. We have focus on the Baltic countries, where Denmark is contributing a lot of soldiers. So, I think it\u2019s a general effort to strengthen the Danish defense,\u201d said researcher Rikke Haugegaard from the Royal Danish Defense College.",

In a report Friday, its preferred gauge, the personal consumption expenditures index, rose to 2.3% in May. That's up from 2.2% the previous month.",
      "The Fed cut interest rates three times in late 2024 following a historic series of rate hikes to cool inflation. The PCE was as high as 7.2% in 2022 while the more commonly used consumer price index hit 9.1%.",

      "Monthly surveys of Chinese factory managers showed manufacturing improving somewhat in June after President Donald Trump delayed imposing higher tariffs, but overall activity was still contracting",
      "BANGKOK -- Chinese factory activity improved somewhat in June after President Donald Trump agreed to delay imposing higher tariffs on imports from China for 90 days, but overall activity was still contracting, according to a survey released Monday.",
      "The purchasing managers index, which reflects new orders and other measures, rose to 49.7 from 49.5 in May, the National Bureau of Statistics reported. That\u2019s on a scale of 0 to 100 where 50 and above shows expansion.",
      "Other reports showed similar trends in Japan and Korea.",
      "Trump has said he\u2019s not planning to extend the 90-day pause on tariffs on most nations beyond July 9. The delay for imposing much higher tariffs on China, agreed to in early May, expires about a month later.",
      "The hiatus for tariffs brought a revival of manufacturing activity as companies and individuals rushed to take advantage of lower import duties. But that mainly helped large manufacturers, with small and mid-size companies' output still contracting. Hiring also fell.",
      "New export orders and exports also remained below the 50-level that marks expansion.",
      "In Japan, manufacturing output edged 0.5% higher in May, well below analysts' estimates for a 3.5% increase.",
      "\u201cThe subdued rise in industrial production in May means that firms were not benefitting from sky-high U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, and their production forecasts point to continued weakness,\u201d Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "South Korea's government reported that its \u201call industry\u201d measure of output fell 2.9% from a year earlier in May, with production of computer chips falling 2%. Production of vehicles fell 2.3% year-on-year, after falling 4.1% in April.",
      "In an interview with Fox News Channel's \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d Trump said he\u2019s not planning to extend a 90-day pause on tariffs on most nations beyond July 9. The delay for imposing much higher tariffs on China, agreed to in early May, expires about a month later.",
      "Trump said his administration will notify countries that the trade penalties will take effect unless there are deals with the United States. He had played down the deadline at a White House news conference Friday by noting how difficult it would be to work out separate deals with each nation. The administration had set a goal of reaching 90 trade deals in 90 days.",
      "Despite a recent trade deal with Beijing over rare earth exports from China, establishing a fairer relationship will require significant tariffs.",
      "Details of the latest agreement to deescalate trade tensions are scarce and major issues between the world\u2019s two biggest economies remain unresolved.",
      "\u201cI think getting along well with China is a very good thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cChina\u2019s going to be paying a lot of tariffs, but we have a big (trade) deficit, they understand that.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG -- It\u2019s been years since mass arrests all but silenced pro-democracy activism in Hong Kong. But a crackdown on dissent in the semiautonomous Chinese city is still expanding, hitting restaurants, bookstores and other small businesses.",
      "Shops and eateries owned by people once associated with the largely subdued pro-democracy movement are feeling a tightening grip through increased official inspections, anonymous complaint letters and other regulatory checks.",
      "Those critical of the city's political changes say it\u2019s a less visible side of a push to silence dissent that began five years ago when Beijing imposed a national security law to crush challenges to its rule, under which opposition politicians were jailed and pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily was shuttered.",
      "China said the law was necessary for the city's stability following anti-government protests in 2019.",
      "In 2024, the city passed its own national security law, which has been used to jail people for actions like writing pro-independence messages on the back of bus seats and wearing a T-shirt carrying a protest slogan that authorities deemed could imply the separation of Hong Kong from China, a red line for Beijing.",
      "In recent weeks, food authorities sent letters to restaurants warning that their business licenses could be revoked if the government deems them to be endangering national security or public interest.",
      "Leticia Wong, a former pro-democracy district councilor who now runs a bookstore, says her shop is frequently visited by food and hygiene inspectors, the fire department or other authorities over complaints about issues like hosting events without a license. It happens most often around June 4, the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.",
      "Her records show government authorities took measures against her shop some 92 times between July 2022 and June 2025, including inspecting her shop, conspicuously patrolling outside, or sending letters warning her of violations. She has been studying regulations to protect herself from accidentally breaking them.",
      "\"Some areas look trivial \u2014 and they really are \u2014 but they still have the power to make you face consequences,\" she said.",
      "In an emailed reply to The Associated Press, the fire department said it conducted checks at Wong\u2019s business following multiple complaints this year. Wong\u2019s bookstore passed most of them but still faces enforcement action for failing to provide valid certificates for two fire extinguishers and its emergency lighting system, it said.",
      "Other small business owners described similar experiences.",
      "A bakery that put up pro-democracy decorations during the 2019 protests saw food authorities\u2019 inspections jump from quarterly to monthly over the past one to two years, mostly over labeling complaints. Its owner, who asked to remain anonymous fearing government retribution, said the frequent inspections made running the business a struggle.",
      "A restaurant owner who received the notice of the newly added terms on possible license revocation over national security violations said he doesn\u2019t know what could be considered a violation and fears one wrong move could cost his staff their jobs. He spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing potential impact on his business partners and employees.",
      "Food authorities said inspections follow the law, information and public complaints. They maintained that the new national security conditions for food business licenses were clearly defined and would not affect law-abiding operators.",
      "The Hong Kong Chief Executive's office has not immediately commented.",
      "Others say they have lost opportunities after anonymous letters were sent to employers or business partners.",
      "Wong said an anonymous letter sent to an organization that had planned an event at her shop prompted them to cancel the booking. Separately, she lost a freelance job after a funder demanded that a social enterprise not hire her without a specific reason.",
      "Her landlord also received an anonymous letter warning them not to rent the space to her.",
      "\u201cI feel that this society is working very hard \u2014 that is, within the system, under the official system, working very hard to reject me, or to make my life difficult,\u201d Wong said.",
      "Chan Kim-kam, another former district councilor, says she lost both a part-time job and a role in a play after the people she worked for were pressured. A school where she taught sociology part-time asked her to leave after it received a letter claiming that she made a student uncomfortable.",
      "The letter, which was written in the simplified Chinese characters used in mainland China but less prominently in Hong Kong, included links to news reports about her arrest under the homegrown national security law last year, though she was never charged.",
      "Meanwhile, the city\u2019s Leisure and Cultural Services Department told her drama group to replace her or lose their venue, she said.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really such a pity. When the culture of reporting people has become so intense, it destroys the trust between people,\u201d she said.",
      "Cultural authorities, declining to discuss specific bookings, said all their venue bookings were managed under established procedures.",
      "Hong Kong leader John Lee has said the security law upholds the rule of law principle and only an extremely small portion of people were targeted. He noted 332 people have been arrested for offenses related to national security, about 66 each year on average, or 0.2% of the police\u2019s annual arrest figures. Still, he warned of persisting soft resistance, saying \u201cthe streets are full of petty people.\u201d",
      "Local broadcaster i-Cable News said national security guidelines would be issued to government workers. Secretary for Security Chris Tang told the broadcaster that even a cleaner should report words endangering national security, if any are found during their job.",
      "But Eric Lai, a research fellow at Georgetown Center for Asian Law, said Hong Kong is using regulatory powers to monitor and regulate dissent without checks and balances. Local courts were unable to check the powers granted to the government under the security laws, he said.",
      "It fits a common pattern among undemocratic governments like mainland China, he said. In many cases across the border, law enforcement officers frequently harass and surveil dissenters without formal charges.",
      "\u201cIt tells the world that the so-called rule of law in Hong Kong is only a facade of rule by men,\u201d he said.",

      "On Sunday, the party announced it had dissolved, citing immense political pressure and consideration of consequences for its members, months after the city\u2019s biggest pro-democracy party announced to move toward disbandment. Its chairperson Chan Po-ying wiped away tears at the news conference.",
      "\u201cIn the past, the government said it focused on a small portion of people. Now, it includes various kinds of people in Hong Kong, ordinary residents,\u201d she said.",

      "China has reopened its market to seafood from Japan after a nearly two-year ban over the discharge of slightly radioactive wastewater from the tsunami-destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant",
      "BEIJING -- China has reopened its market to seafood from Japan after a nearly two-year ban over the discharge of slightly radioactive wastewater from the tsunami-destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant.",
      "A notice from the customs agency said the ban had been lifted Sunday and that imports from much of Japan would be resumed.",
      "The ban, imposed in August 2023, was a major blow to Japan's scallop and sea cucumber exporters. China was the biggest overseas market for Japanese seafood, accounting for more than one-fifth of its exports. The decision to lift the ban coincides with efforts by China and Japan to improve ties as both face economic uncertainty because of the American tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The nuclear plant at Fukushima was heavily damaged by a deadly tsunami that followed a huge offshore earthquake in 2011. Water still must be pumped in to cool the radioactive fuel. The water is then stored in what was an ever-growing complex of tanks on the property.",
      "After years of debate, the utility won Japanese government permission to discharge the water gradually into the sea after treating it to remove most of the radioactive elements and diluting it with seawater. Japanese officials said the wastewater would be safer than international standards and have negligible environmental impact.",
      "China disagreed and imposed a ban, saying the discharge would endanger the fishing industry and coastal communities on its east coast.",
      "Over months of talks, Japan agreed to let China take samples of the water for testing. The sampling has not found any abnormalities, the customs agency notice said",
      "China still opposes the wastewater discharge, but based on scientific evidence and analysis, it is allowing imports on a conditional basis from parts of Japan that meet China's standards, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.",
      "A ban remains in place for seafood from 10 of Japan's 47 prefectures, including Fukushima and nearby ones.",
      "Japanese seafood exporters will have to reapply for registration in China and all imports will have to include a health certificate, a certificate of compliance for radioactive substance testing and a certificate of origin, the Chinese customs agency said.",
      "Shipments to China are expected to resume gradually, Japanese government spokesperson Kazuhiko Aoki told reporters in Tokyo on Monday, noting the re-registration requirement.",
      "He said it was unclear how quickly scallop and sea cucumber exporters would return to China, because they had sought out other markets since the ban. But he predicted sales of sea cucumbers, a prized delicacy in China, would recover to a certain degree.",
      "Aoki said the Japanese government would continue to press for the lifting of the export ban on the other 10 prefectures.",

      "The document says the leaders and high-level representatives have decided to launch \u201can ambitious package of reforms and actions to close the financing gap with urgency,\u201d saying it is now estimated at $4 trillion a year.",
      "Among the proposals and actions, it calls for minimum tax revenue of 15% of a country's gross domestic product to increase government resources, a tripling of lending by multilateral development banks, and scaling up private financing by providing incentives for investing in critical areas like infrastructure. It also calls for a number of reforms to help countries deal with rising debt.",

      "Clayton Kershaw is on the brink of a major milestone, needing just three strikeouts to reach 3,000 for his career",
      "It's a big number for one of the biggest baseball stars of this generation \u2014 three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw is closing in on 3,000 strikeouts.",
      "He needs just three more punchouts to reach the mark, meaning it likely will happen in front of an adoring home crowd at Dodger Stadium when Los Angeles hosts the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday night. Kershaw would become just the 20th pitcher in MLB history \u2014 and one of three active pitchers along with Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer \u2014 to hit the milestone.",
      "It's a time for celebration. It's also a time for wistful contemplation.",
      "Are we nearing the end of these kinds of career celebrations \u2014 particularly for pitchers?",
      "Kershaw is one of the final holdovers from his generation, one that included guys who threw at least 200 innings year after year, piling up wins and strikeouts thanks to consistent excellence. In his prime from 2010 to 2015, the 6-foot-4 lefty led the National League in ERA five times, in strikeouts three times and wins twice.",
      "His peak arguably came in 2014, when he finished with a 21-3 record, 1.77 ERA and 233 strikeouts to win both the Cy Young and Most Valuable Player in the National League.",
      "Kershaw, now 37, isn't the same pitcher these days, though his success over the past month is a testament to the knowledge, grit and sheer willpower that only an 18-year veteran can possess. He is 4-0 with a 3.03 ERA through eight starts since returning from injury, providing an injury-riddled Dodgers rotation with a spark despite a fastball that barely hits 90 mph on a good day.",
      "\u201cHe has given us a shot in the arm,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of ailing on the starting pitching side. Coming in and giving us valuable innings. I just love that kind of edge that he gives on start day.",
      "\u201cWe certainly feed off that.\u201d",
      "Kershaw's twilight is coinciding with the final years of Verlander and Scherzer, and the trio is primed to join the Hall of Fame over the next decade. The group symbolizes what might be the last gasp of long-term excellence on the pitcher's mound.",
      "The 42-year-old Verlander has won 262 career games while Kershaw and Scherzer \u2014 who turns 41 this month \u2014 both sit at 216. After that, the career leaderboards fall off dramatically.",
      "It's fair to wonder if any other MLB pitcher ever will reach 200 career wins again, much less 300, which was the gold standard for generations and last reached by the likes of Randy Johnson, Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux and Roger Clemens in the 2000s and 2010s.",
      "Consider this: The current career wins leader for a pitcher under 30 is the 28-year-old Logan Webb, who has a grand total of 62.",
      "Getting to 3,000 strikeouts is a little more realistic given the sport-wide increase in pitch velocity, but even that's in question. Atlanta's Chris Sale (2,528 Ks) is 36 and could get there with a few more healthy seasons. New York's Gerrit Cole (2,254) has a chance, too \u2014 if the 34-year-old can bounce back from elbow surgery.",
      "But again, the list of pitchers piling up strikeouts in their 20s is conspicuously absent.",
      "The 29-year-old Dylan Cease is the under-30 leader with 1,133 career Ks, but he likely will need a decade of good health to get close. By comparison, Kershaw had 2,120 strikeouts entering his age-30 season.",
      "There are some young, promising arms that might emerge in the future \u2014 think Paul Skenes and Tarik Skubal \u2014 but the trends aren't pointing in the right direction.",

      "Surely, career-altering injuries have been a part of baseball forever, but this feels different.",
      "To dominate in today's game, velocity is paramount. So is movement. The main goal is to make the baseball move as quickly and violently as possible, and today's pitchers are throwing nastier pitches than ever before. A big fastball used to be anything in the 90s just a few decades ago. Now, that number is closer to 100.",
      "The big problem is that most human arms don't seem to be able to handle the stress \u2014 particularly for the lengthy amounts of time needed to chase 300 wins, 3,000 strikeouts or many of the other career milestones that once defined greatness.",
      "Over the next generation, the metrics that determine which pitchers enter Cooperstown will likely change dramatically. Arizona righty Zac Gallen \u2014 who has 58 career wins and turns 30 in August \u2014 said last year that it's possible some pitchers from the current generation will be left out of the Hall of Fame as the definition of excellence changes.",

      "Jake Paul has entered the World Boxing Association\u2019s cruiserweight rankings",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Jake Paul has entered the World Boxing Association's cruiserweight rankings, making the YouTuber-turned-boxer eligible to fight for a world title.",
      "The WBA slotted Paul (12-1, 7 KOs) at No. 14 in the latest edition of its rankings late Monday night, two days after Paul beat 39-year-old Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr. by unanimous decision in Anaheim, California.",
      "The WBA's decision to rank Paul likely means the sanctioning body would allow him to fight WBA cruiserweight champion Gilberto \u201cZurdo\u201d Ram\u00edrez, who won his latest title defense in the penultimate bout in Anaheim. The fighters have not agreed to a deal, but Paul and Ram\u00edrez stared each other down during the post-fight news conference.",
      "\u201cI want tougher fighters. I want to be a world champion,\u201d Paul said after outpointing Ch\u00e1vez, who had fought once in the previous four years. \u201cZurdo looked slow ... tonight. That'd be easy work, too.\u201d",
      "While Paul's ranking is a remarkable milestone for a social media behemoth and former Disney Channel star who only decided to become a boxer about six years ago, the WBA's decision reflects Paul's incredible financial potential more than his fighting resume.",
      "Sanctioning body rankings are determined internally, so they can be changed on a whim, or to meet an opportunity to collect a big fee by sanctioning a fight \u2014 and Paul has uniquely become the most financially potent boxer to emerge in many years.",
      "Paul's previous opponents include fellow YouTubers, an NBA player, several mixed martial artists and 58-year-old Mike Tyson \u2014 not a path that would lead to world rankings and title shots for any fighter without Paul's fame and fortune.",
      "He took his only loss in 2023 against Tommy Fury \u2014 a relatively serious professional boxer, but nowhere near a title contender. Paul has called for a rematch, telling Fury to \u201cstop running from me.\u201d",
      "Ch\u00e1vez was by far the most accomplished actual boxer to share the ring with Paul, but the former WBC middleweight champion fought listlessly and tepidly for all but the final two rounds in front of a Southern California crowd desperately rooting on its Mexican hero.",
      "Paul reiterated Saturday night that he has been ordered by God to become a world champion, and he spoke of several accomplished veteran boxers as his potential next opponent.",
      "Ram\u00edrez (48-1, 30 KOs) would be Paul's first step up to world-class opposition. Zurdo is a former super middleweight champion and current cruiserweight powerhouse who beat Yuniel Dorticos by decision in Anaheim.",
      "Nakisa Bidarian, Paul's business partner, suggested Saturday night that Paul might be more likely to take a title shot against Badou Jack, the 41-year-old Swede who holds the WBC cruiserweight belt.",
      "\u201cThe biggest issue with that (Paul vs. Ram\u00edrez) fight is Zurdo didn\u2019t show himself to be at all a promoter in this process,\u201d Bidarian said. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we seeing more out of Zurdo? Why isn\u2019t he more engaged with the fans? Someone like Badou Jack is someone that we want to have a conversation with.\u201d",

      "From the start of the Open era in 1968 through 2023, only one reigning women\u2019s champ was defeated in the first round at Wimbledon: Steffi Graf in 1994.",
      "But it happened last year to Marketa Vondrousova of the Czech Republic \u2014 whose title in 2023 made her the first unseeded woman to leave the All England Club with the singles trophy \u2014 and there were moments early Tuesday that it appeared it might happen again this year to the 17th-seeded Krejcikova, another Czech player and the French Open champion in 2021.",
      "Eala is a 20-year-old left-hander who was competing at a Grand Slam tournament for only the second time. She lost in the first round at Roland-Garros in May.",
      "Eala is the only woman representing the Philippines to compete in the main draw of Wimbledon in the Open era.",
      "She signed with an agent when she was just 13 and honed her tennis skills at the Rafael Nadal Academy, getting advice from the 22-time major title winner who retired at the end of last season.",
      "Eala was seeking what would have been her fourth top-20 victory of 2025. She grabbed attention at the Miami Open by getting past 2017 French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko, Australian Open champion Madison Keys and former No. 1 and five-time major champ Iga Swiatek en route to the semifinals.",
      "Last week, Eala again defeated Ostapenko at the grass-court Eastbourne Open along the way to reaching the final there.",
      "Krejcikova, who is 29, made it to the quarterfinals at Eastbourne before withdrawing from that tournament because of an issue with her right thigh.",
      "She started slowly Tuesday, making 19 unforced errors in the first set. But Krejcikova cleaned up her play and had a total of 18 the rest of the way, often leaning forward with a clenched fist and a yell to celebrate points that moved her closer to the win.",

      "The oil-rich kingdom, which is spending billions of dollars to become a major player in the world's most popular sport, scored a big win on the field Monday when Al Hilal beat Premier League giant Manchester City 4-3 to advance to the quarterfinals.",
      "It was a seismic result in soccer terms; possibly the biggest upset of the tournament and precisely the type of statement Saudi Arabia has wanted to make since embarking on a project that will ultimately see it stage the World Cup in 2034.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to show that Al Hilal has the talent, the power to be here,\u201d said defender Kalidou Koulibaly, who was among a slew of star players paid fortunes to leave Europe's top clubs for the Saudi Pro League in recent years.",
      "The biggest of them all was Cristiano Ronaldo, who completed one of the most stunning moves in soccer history when joining Al Nassr for a reported salary of up to $200 million a year in 2022. That deal prompted a spectacular recruitment drive by Saudi teams \u2014 backed by the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund \u2014 and in came superstars like Neymar and Karim Benzema, while audacious attempts were made to sign Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe.",
      "Confirmation that Saudi Arabia had won the right to host the World Cup came in December. On the field, the Club World Cup was the first chance for the country to make a global statement about the growth of its domestic game, which is largely unheralded outside of Asia.",
      "It is likely why Al Hilal \u2014 Saudi Arabia's most successful team \u2014 was so eager to make another marquee signing before the tournament began and tried, but failed, to lure Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "It pulled off a coup by hiring coach Simone Inzaghi. The Italian arrived after leading Inter Milan to a second Champions League final in three seasons and he is already making a mark with his new team after drawing 1-1 against Real Madrid in the group stage and then beating City.",
      "\u201cWe had to do something extraordinary because we knew how good Manchester City are, we knew we had to climb Mount Everest without oxygen, and we were great,\" Inzaghi said.",
      "The broader picture is what Al Hilal's run says about the standard of soccer in Saudi Arabia, which has been dismissed by some as a cash grab for players, who can earn far more than if they'd remained in Europe.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s see now if they will criticize us after these games,\" said midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who joined Al Hilal from Italian team Lazio. \u201cIt's not like how they are speaking about the league.\u201d",
      "Despite recruiting so many players from Europe's top clubs \u2014 including Champions League winners N'Golo Kante, Riyad Mahrez and Roberto Firmino \u2014 it is difficult to judge the quality of the Saudi League.",
      "To put Al Hilal's run into context: while it may have won a record 19 league titles and four Asian championships, it is not the Saudi Arabia's reigning national champion, having been beaten to the title by Benzema's Al-Ittihad last season.",
      "Another Saudi team, Al-Ahli, which counts former Liverpool forward Firmino and ex Manchester City winger Mahrez among its players, won the Asian Champions League this year.",
      "Ronaldo, meanwhile, is yet to win the title in three attempts with Al Nassr \u2014 pointing to the depth of strength in the league.",
      "Al Hilal's performances have also come despite releasing Brazil great Neymar in January and with leading scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic having played no part so far because of injury.",
      "The question now is how far Al Hilal can go.",
      "Next up is Brazil's Fluminense in the quarterfinals in Orlando on Friday.",
      "City's exit \u2014 along with Inter Milan's defeat to Fluminense \u2014 has opened up that side of the draw, which also features Palmeiras and Chelsea.",
      "On paper it looks like the favorable side of the draw, with Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain on the other side. But the success of Brazilian teams has been another theme of the tournament and Al Hilal will have to beat at least one more if it is to advance to the final.",
      "Inzaghi, however, is used to overachieving. His two Champions League finals with Inter Milan came despite having an aging team and relying on savvy deals in the transfer market to pick up free agents and veteran players.",
      "Inter's victory against Barcelona in the semifinals of this year's competition was one of the all-time classic contests \u2014 winning 7-6 on aggregate.",
      "Al Hilal's impressive run has come after Inzaghi spent just one week training with the team before the tournament.",
      "Even if it is eliminated in the next round, a quarterfinals appearance would represent an outstanding campaign for a team that was not expected to compete for the title.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s growing influence on sport \u2014 which also includes LIV Golf, world championship boxing, F1 and the buyout of Premier League team Newcastle \u2014 will continue to raise accusations it is \u201csportswashing\u201d its reputation. Amnesty international called it \u201creckless\u201d to grant it the World Cup over concerns about the country\u2019s human rights record.",

      "The LPGA Tour has never had parity like this to start the year",
      "The lingering question for the last three months on the LPGA Tour was when Nelly Korda finally would win this year.",
      "Now the question should be who's going to win next?",
      "The latest entrants into the 2025 winner's ledgers were Somi Lee and Jin Hee Im at the Dow Championship, the only official team event on the LPGA schedule. That made it 17 straight tournaments with different winners.",
      "The LPGA has not seen this level of parity \u2014 or maybe it's lack of dominance \u2014 in its 75-year history. The previous record to start a season was 15 different winners in 2017 and 1991.",
      "Perhaps even more telling was this amazing streak of different winners was assured long before the South Korean duo birdied the first playoff hole to beat out Lexi Thompson and Megan Khang. That's because no one from the top 16 teams on the leaderboard at the Dow Championship had won this year.",
      "And to think it was a year ago when Korda ran off five straight victories to tie an LPGA record and ended the season with seven wins and as the dominant figure in women's golf. It would be asking a lot for her to repeat that (Scottie Scheffler is nodding his head), though it's still somewhat surprising that Korda hasn't registered a win halfway through the season.",
      "\u201cIt's golf,\u201d Korda said going into the KPMG Women's PGA Championship two weeks ago, where she was on the fringe of contention until the wind blew her into reverse. \"Every year is just so different. Last year coming into this event, I had five wins. I think even Hannah Green had multiple wins under her belt, too.",
      "\u201cIt's just ... it's just golf,\u201d she said. \u201cYou kind of just have to ride the wave, and the competition is getting better and better every year. To win once, to win twice, it's really good.\u201d",
      "The competition certainly is more diverse.",
      "The top 10 players in the women's world ranking represent eight countries. The 17 tournaments this year have been won by players from eight countries \u2014 including South Korea with four wins, and three each for the United States, Sweden and the potentially emerging power of Japan.",
      "But the parity is best illustrated by comparisons to the other streaks of different winners.",
      "There have been five first-time winners on the LPGA (six including both Lee and Im from the Dow Championship), and only three winners came into this year with at least five career victories on the LPGA.",
      "When the 2017 season began with 15 different winners, all of them previously had won on the LPGA and eight of them already had at least five wins. In 1991, which also featured 15 different winners to start the year, there were two first-time winners \u2014 one of them was World Golf Hall of Fame member Meg Mallon \u2014 and nine of those players already had five-plus LPGA wins.",
      "\u201cI think winning out here is getting tougher and tougher,\u201d Carlota Ciganda said after winning the Meijer LPGA Classic, her first LPGA title in more than eight years. \u201cLots of really good players, especially lots of youngster. Also good Japanese and Korean and Asians, and even Americans. Like, I think it's not easy.\"",
      "It's either parity or it's simply cyclical, and these things have a way of working themselves out.",
      "The 2017 season ended with nine multiple winners, none with more than two victories. South Korean rookie Sung-hyun Park and So Yeon Ryu shared the points-based LPGA player of the year, the first time for a tie since the award began in 1966.

      "There's a lot of time left for the season to get some definition, and for Korda to reassert herself as the dominant player in women's golf. That's what Scheffler has done on the men's tour, running off three wins in four tournaments, including a major.",
      "For now, a victory by Korda or Green or Ruoning Yin at No. 4 in the world would only add to a level of diversity the LPGA has never seen.",

      "Wimbledon's latest of many steps into the modern era involves choosing technology over the human touch to decide whether a ball lands in or out",
      "LONDON -- John McEnroe \u2014 he of \u201cYou cannot be serious!\u201d call-arguing fame \u2014 is quite all right with Wimbledon's latest of many steps into the modern era, choosing technology over the human touch to decide whether a ball lands in or out.",
      "There were no line judges at the All England Club's matches for Monday's start of the oldest Grand Slam tournament, with rulings instead being made by an electronic system that uses recorded voices to announce when a shot lands astray.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, the players, and even the fans, miss that interaction, but at the same time ... if it\u2019s accurate, I think it\u2019s great, because then at least you know that you\u2019re getting the right call,\u201d said McEnroe, who won Wimbledon three times during his Hall of Fame career and is a TV analyst at this year's event for ESPN and the BBC.",
      "\u201cMy hair,\u201d the 66-year-old McEnroe joked, \u201cwouldn\u2019t be quite as white as it is now.\u201d",
      "The new system puts Wimbledon in line with nearly ever other top-tier tennis event on all surfaces \u2014 although the French Open, played on red clay, remains an exception, sticking with judges \u2014 and Monday's debut seemed to be mostly seamless, as far as players were concerned.",
      "Indeed, Frances Tiafoe, an American seeded 12th, didn't even notice there were no line judges at his first-round victory.",
      "What he did notice, and chuckled about afterward, was when the chair umpire wasn't even paying all that much attention at one point, grabbing the phone on his stand to place a call and request that more towels be brought to the court on the hottest Day 1 in tournament history.",
      "\u201cIt takes him completely out of play,\u201d Tiafoe said about the on-court official, \u201cother than just calling the score and calling time violations.\u201d",
      "No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka liked that the All England Club's switch to electronic line-calling eliminated the need for her to question whether she should contest a ruling. From 2007 until last year, players were allowed to ask for a video replay to check whether a decision was correct.",
      "\u201cIf you have line umpires, you (are) always thinking, like, \u2018Should I challenge or shouldn\u2019t I?\u2019\" she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of doubt in your head.\u201d",
      "Cam Norrie was pleased that there no longer is a reason to get angry about what's perceived as a wrong decision, the way McEnroe \u2014 and plenty of others through the years \u2014 used to.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s good. You get on with it. There\u2019s no kind of getting mad at anyone for missing a call or saying something or moving during the point or something happening,\u201d said Norrie, a British player who won Monday. \u201dIt's pretty black-or-white with the calls. In, out, and you hear it. There\u2019s no mistake.\"",
      "Not everything is favorable in his view, though.",
      "The familiar scene of officials sitting or standing around the court \u201clooks cool,\u201d Norrie said. Plus, he noted the loss of work for some of the 275 line judges the tournament used in the past (80 were brought back as \u201cmatch assistants\u201d to help chair umpires from behind the scenes).",
      "\u201cThe decision we've made there, I suppose, is very much about the way in which Wimbledon has always balanced heritage and tradition with innovation and how we walk that line. We're always very conscious of that. ... For us, it was time to make that change,\" All England Club CEO Sally Bolton said. \"It's not a money-saving exercise. It\u2019s about evolving the tournament and making sure that we're providing the most effective possible line-calling.\u201d",
      "Frenchman Adrian Mannarino liked having what he called \u201ca machine\u201d involved Monday, saying: \"You cannot complain against the machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you feel like someone is judging the ball and ... is probably not seeing so well, and maybe not even concentrating, it\u2019s pretty annoying,\" Mannarino said. \u201cBut the fact that it\u2019s a robot calling the balls, there\u2019s nothing to complain about.\u201d",
      "He did caution that it wasn't always easy to figure out which recorded announcements were for his win at Court 5, because it's wedged amid other courts.",
      "Sometimes he thought an \u201cOut!\u201d call at an adjacent match was for his.",
      "\u201cIt can be a little tricky with this,\u201d Mannarino said, \u201cbut overall, I think it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Paige Bueckers will play in her first WNBA All-Star Game while Nneka Ogwumike has earned her 10th selection, the league announced Monday as it named the players who will join Caitlin Clark and Napheesa Collier as All-Star starters.",
      "Bueckers, who was the No. 1 overall draft pick by the Dallas Wings, will be the 10th rookie to start the game. It's the third straight season it's happened, with Clark getting a start last year and Aliyah Boston in 2013. Bueckers is ranked 11th in the league in scoring (18.4 points) and sixth in assists (5.8) to lead all rookies in both categories. She received the sixth most votes from the fans.",
      "Ogwumike, who stars for Seattle, is tied for the third-most All-Star appearances with Tamika Catchings and Brittney Griner. She trails only Sue Bird (13) and Diana Taurasi (11).",
      "Clark and Collier were named captains of the teams on Sunday for receiving the most fan votes. The pair will draft their teams by choosing among the other starters as well as the 12 reserves chosen by coaches. The reserves will be announced this weekend.",
      "New York's Breanna Stewart and Las Vegas' A'ja Wilson each earned a seventh All-Star nod and will be in the starting lineup. Other starters selected Monday by a combination of fan, media and player voting included guards Allisha Gray of Atlanta and Sabrina Ionescu of New York. The frontcourt also will feature Phoenix's Satou Sabally and Boston, Clark's Indiana teammate.",
      "The starters were selected from across the WNBA without regard to conference affiliation. Players and a media panel joined fans in selecting the starters. Fans voting accounted for 50%, while the player and media votes each accounted for 25%.",
      "Boston finished fewer than 1,400 votes behind Minnesota star Collier for second in the fan voting. While Clark finished first in the fan vote, she was ninth in the players' vote and third in the media voting for guards.",
      "Kelsey Mitchell of Indiana and Angel Reese of Chicago both just missed making the All-Star starters list, finishing fifth and seventh, respectively, at their positions.",
      "The game will be played in Indianapolis on July 19.",

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Germ\u00e1n Cano scored on a header three minutes into the match, and Fluminense held on to upset Champions League finalist Inter Milan 2-0 to advance to the Club World Cup quarterfinals in front of a sparse crowd of 20,030 at Bank of America Stadium on Monday.",

      "Mart\u00ednez had a point-blank shot in the second half to tie the game, but the ball hit off the upright. He couldn\u2019t believe his bad luck and shook his head in disbelief.",
      "Fluminense had changed its defensive strategy before the match to use three defensive backs to defend against Milan.",
      "\u201cI thought a lot about what scheme we would use,\u201d Fluminense coach Renato Ga\u00facho said. \u201cWe should have three backs so we could mirror their own group. They were compliant with my instructions. We have been humble and we knew how to respect the opponent when they had the ball. I told them \u2018I trust you.\u2019 I told them yesterday and I told them again today and I told them, \u2018I believe it.\u2019 The players adapted very well.\u201d",

      "Victor Wembanyama has another big man to help him out in San Antonio. The Houston Rockets continued their offseason overhaul. And Orlando and Atlanta made moves with eyes on contending this coming season as the NBA's free agency period got underway Monday.",
      "The Spurs lured center Luke Kornet away from Boston with a four-year, $41 million deal, a person with knowledge of the agreement told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team cannot announce the deal until the league's signing moratorium for most contracts is lifted on Sunday.",
      "Kornet was part of Boston's 2024 NBA title team and has shot 68% from the field in 205 games, mostly off the bench, over the last three regular seasons. He figures to add frontcourt depth to the Spurs, who are hoping to have Wembanyama \u2014 the 2023-24 NBA Rookie of the Year and an All-Star this past season \u2014 back and ready to go after he was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in a shoulder back in February.",

      "Houston becomes Finney-Smith's fourth team after stints with Dallas, Brooklyn and the Los Angeles Lakers. He'll be added to a Rockets club that earlier this summer landed Kevin Durant in a blockbuster trade with Phoenix, though that deal cannot receive formal approval from the NBA until next week.",
      "Finney-Smith averaged 8.7 points and was a 41% shooter from 3-point range this past season.",
      "ESPN also reported that the Rockets' run on free agents continued with the addition of center Clint Capela, who spent the first six years of his career in Houston before playing for the last five seasons in Atlanta. Capela agreed to a three-year deal with the Rockets, ESPN said.",
      "Dallas, which needed some point guard help especially because the newly re-signed Kyrie Irving \u2014 rehabbing from an ACL tear \u2014 may not be ready to play until about midseason, agreed with D'Angelo Russell on a two-year contract worth nearly $13 million.",
      "Russell would be part of the backcourt depth on a club with an imposing front line that, if healthy, would include No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg, 10-time All-Star Anthony Davis and promising young center Dereck Lively II.",
      "Atlanta added Nickeil Alexander-Walker from Minnesota on what will be a four-year, $62 million deal following a completion of a sign-and-trade with the Timberwolves. Minnesota will get a draft pick, cash considerations and will create a trade exception once the deal is finalized, a person with knowledge of the move told AP.",
      "The Magic, meanwhile, added Tyus Jones on a one-year deal. He joins an Orlando roster that already landed Desmond Bane from Memphis in a trade, and the Magic \u2014 who played long stretches last season without Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner and Jalen Suggs because of injuries \u2014 should be a legit East contender this season if healthy.",
      "It was a big night for the Jones family: Tyus Jones' brother, Tre Jones, agreed Monday on a three-year deal to return to the Chicago Bulls.",
      "The free agency period officially opened at 6 p.m. Eastern time on Monday, but in actuality, was rolling long before that.",
      "LeBron James has already opted in to a $52.6 million deal with the Los Angeles Lakers for this coming season, the Rockets traded for Durant \u2014 not a free agency move, obviously \u2014 and the Los Angeles Clippers saw James Harden decline his option in return for a new deal and a raise. There was even a surprise addition to free agency, with Portland announcing it has bought out the contract of former No. 1 pick Deandre Ayton, allowing him to sign with any team he chooses.",
      "And on Monday, even before the shopping window officially started, more deals: Nicolas Batum will come back to the Clippers, his agency said, on a two-year deal, while Joe Ingles agreed to return to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Deals like those could get done before the official start time because teams are allowed to negotiate with their own free agents once the NBA Finals are finished.",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Carlos Alcaraz, locked in a five-set struggle at Centre Court, looked toward his coach Monday and shouted something about how Fabio Fognini \u2014 38, retiring after this season, winless in 2025 \u2014 looked as if he could keep playing until he\u2019s 50.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s his last Wimbledon,\u201d Alcaraz said later, \u201cbecause the level he has shown, he can still play three or four more years. Unbelievable.\u201d",
      "The two-time defending champion at the All England Club needed to go through more than 4 1/2 hours of back-and-forth shifts against the much-older and much-less-accomplished Fognini before emerging with a 7-5, 6-7 (5), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 victory in the first round.",

      "Consider, too, that Fognini has never been past the third round at the All England Club in 15 appearances and reached the quarterfinals at any major tournament just once \u2014 way back at the 2011 French Open. He entered Monday ranked 138th and 0-6 this year.",
      "Oh, and then there\u2019s this: Only twice has the reigning men\u2019s champion at Wimbledon been beaten in the first round the following year, Lleyton Hewitt in 2003 and Manuel Santana in 1967.",
      "There were times Monday when Alcaraz appeared to be something less than his best, far from the form he displayed during his epic five-set, 5 1/2-hour comeback victory over No. 1 Jannik Sinner for the championship at Roland-Garros.",
      "Alcaraz double-faulted nine times. He faced a hard-to-believe 21 break points. He made more unforced errors, 62, than winners, 52.",
      "He chalked some of that up to nerves.",
      "\u201cPlaying the first match at Centre Court, and the first match of every tournament, is never easy,\u201d said Alcaraz, who beat Novak Djokovic in the 2023 and 2024 finals at that arena. \u201cI've been practicing pretty well. I've been playing on grass really well. But Wimbledon is special. It's different.\u201d",
      "Next for Alcaraz will be a match Wednesday against Oliver Tarvet, a 21-year-old British qualifier who plays college tennis at the University of San Diego and is ranked 733rd.",
      "Still, Alcaraz said: \u201cI have to improve in the next round.\u201d",
      "Fognini \u2014 whose wife, 2015 U.S. Open champion Flavia Pennetta, held one of their children in the stands \u2014 is a self-described hot-head and is known for mid-match flareups, including at Wimbledon, where he was fined $3,000 in 2019 for saying during a match that he wished \u201ca bomb would explode at the club\u201d and a then-record $27,500 in 2014 for a series of outbursts. He was put on a two-year probation by the Grand Slam Board in 2017 after insulting a female chair umpire at the U.S. Open and getting kicked out of that tournament.",
      "Such behavior wasn't displayed Monday. And when Alcaraz pushed a forehand long to cede the fourth set, Fognini nodded toward his guest box, where a member of his entourage stood to snap a photo with a cellphone. Things were picture-perfect for Fognini at that moment.",
      "But at the outset of the fifth \u2014 the first time the previous year\u2019s male champ was pushed that far in the first round since Roger Federer in 2010 \u2014 Alcaraz recalibrated.",
      "When the Spaniard broke to lead 2-0 in that set with a backhand volley winner, he pointed toward the stands, threw an uppercut and screamed, \u201cVamos!\u201d In the next game, he saved a pair of break points, before the match was paused for more than 10 minutes because a spectator felt ill amid record-breaking high temperatures for Day 1 of Wimbledon.",
      "When they resumed, Alcaraz outplayed Fognini the rest of the way.",
      "While Alcaraz escaped, at least five seeded men exited on Day 1, including No. 8 Holger Rune, No. 9 Daniil Medvedev \u2014 who also lost in the first round at the French Open \u2014 No. 16 Francisco Cerundolo, No. 20 Alexei Popyrin and No. 24 Stefanos Tsitsipas, who quit because of a persistent lower-back problem after dropping the first two sets. No. 20 Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 French Open champ, lost, while women\u2019s winners included No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, 2023 Wimbledon winner Marketa Vondrousova and 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu.",
      "No. 2 Coco Gauff, coming off her second major title, plays in Day 2's last match at Centre Court against Dayana Yastremska. The other matches in the main arena, starting at 1:30 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. ET), are defending champion Barbora Krejcikova against Alexandra Eala, followed by 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic against Alexandre Muller. No. 1 Sinner meets fellow Italian Luca Nardi at No. 1 Court.",

      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Jalen Williams is planning to have surgery on his right wrist after the Oklahoma City forward tore a ligament before the Thunder started their run to a championship, general manager Sam Presti said Monday.",
      "Williams played in all 23 postseason games in helping the Thunder win their first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma from Seattle 17 years ago. He scored a playoff career-high 40 points in a 120-109 win over Indiana in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. Oklahoma City beat the Pacers in seven games.",
      "The 24-year-old Williams is expected to be ready for next season, Presti said. Williams was inactive for the final two games of the regular season after playing 36 minutes in a 125-112 victory over Phoenix on April 9.",
      "Williams wrote a brace on the wrist on his shooting hand at times during the playoffs and had it taped during games. He shot just 30% from 3-point range in the playoffs, more than 6% off his percentage during the regular season.",
      "\u201cThe part that I\u2019m most impressed with is in our modern era, when someone has a poor performance or they\u2019re not playing to their capability in a game and there\u2019s a lot of attention on it, you often see a little birdie make sure that everybody knows that the player is not 100%,\u201d Presti said during his season-ending meeting with reporters. \u201cNever happened with this guy, not one time. He powered through. He showed incredible mental endurance and security in himself.\u201d",
      "A first-time All-Star in his third season after the Thunder drafted him 12th overall out of Santa Clara in 2022, Williams averaged career bests of 21.6 points, 5.3 rebounds and 5.1 assists.",

Maria Cantwell of Washington on Monday night to introduce an amendment to strike the entire proposal.

      "A federal judge has allowed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple to proceed, rejecting the company's request to dismiss the case",

      "The 33\u2014page opinion from U.S. District Judge Xavier Neals in New Jersey will enable an antitrust lawsuit that the U.S. Justice Department filed against Apple 15 months ago to proceed. Neals has set a timetable that could see the case come to trial in 2027.",
      "Apple has sought to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing the Justice Department had distorted the contours of the smartphone market and made a series of other misinterpretations that warranted the case be thrown out.",
      "But Neals decided there is enough evidence to support the Justice Department's market definitions and concluded the case's key allegations merited further examination at trial.",
      "The case seeks to pierce the digital fortress that Apple Inc., based in Cupertino, California, has built around the iPhone, iPad and other products to create a so-called \u201cwalled garden\u201d allowing its hardware and software to mesh seamlessly for users.",
      "The Justice Department alleges that walled garden has mostly turned into a shield against competition, creating market conditions that enable it to charge higher prices and stifle innovation.",
      "The lawsuit \u201csets forth several allegations of technological barricades that constitute anticompetitive conduct,\u201d Neals wrote in his opinion. The judge also concluded the Justice Department had pointed toward enough areas of troubling conduct that raised the \u201cdangerous possibility\u201d that Apple has turned the iPhone into an illegal monopoly.",
      "In a Monday statement, Apple reiterated its position that the Justice Department's case \u201cis wrong on the facts and the law, and we will continue to vigorously fight it in court.\u201d",

      "Another federal judge in April issued a civil contempt order banning Apple from collecting any fees from in-app transactions on the iPhone that are funneled through other options besides its once-exclusive payment processing system that charged commissions ranging from 15% to 30%.",
      "Apple also could lose a more than $20 billion annual payment that it gets for making Google the default search tool on the iPhone and other products as part of another antitrust case brought by the Justice Department. A federal judge in Washington D.C. is considering whether to ban the deals with Apple as part of a shake-up being proposed to address Google's illegal monopoly in searc h.",
      "Neals' decision to allow the Justice Department's antitrust case to proceed came on the same day that Apple was hit with a lawsuit by app maker Proton amplifying the accusations of wrongful conduct by the company. The lawsuit, which will seek to be certified as a class action presenting thousands of developers who have made iPhone apps, is asking for punitive damages against Apple, as well as a court order to dismantle its walled garden.",

      "Giving Funds is GoFundMe\u2019s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered",
      "NEW YORK -- GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall.",
      "Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived.",
      "\u201cIt was just a bit of a thing,\u201d he added. \"If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.\u201d",
      "Giving Funds are GoFundMe's latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company's DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers \u2014 products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts.",
      "To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur's circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they\u2019re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they\u2019re coming in and they\u2019re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cThat connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.\u201d",
      "Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit.",
      "The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals.",
      "There's since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements.",
      "GoFundMe's Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company's standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors.",
      "Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving \u2014 something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn't occurred because DAFs have been framed as \u201cwealth management products.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a giving product,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s something for everybody. And you don\u2019t need to know the words \u2018donor advised fund.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d",
      "DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes \u2014 even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023.",
      "Cadogan believes GoFundMe's culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends' charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas.",
      "That \u201cdynamic, alive community\u201d is very different from the \u201cfairly static, passive\u201d financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially inspiring the money to move,\u201d he said.",
      "Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning.",
      "Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative's recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the \u201csweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.\u201d",
      "The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it's a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are \u201cavailable-to-everyone vehicles\" considering that half run balances under $50,000.",
      "\u201cGivers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.\u201d",
      "But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe's entrance as \u201ca game changer\u201d that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years.",
      "Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a \u201csavings account\" for \"good works.\"",
      "\u201cAnd GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,\u201d she said.",

      "Four teams of humanoid robots faced off in fully autonomous 3-on-3 soccer matches powered entirely by artificial intelligence on Saturday night in China's capital in what was touted as a first in China and a preview for the upcoming World Humanoid Robot Games, set to take place in Beijing.",
      "According to the organizers, a key aspect of the match was that all the participating robots operated fully autonomously using AI-driven strategies without any human intervention or supervision.",
      "Equipped with advanced visual sensors, the robots were able to identify the ball and navigate the field with agility",
      "They were also designed to stand up on their own after falling. However, during the match several still had to be carried off the field on stretchers by staff, adding to the realism of the experience.",
      "China is stepping up efforts to develop AI-powered humanoid robots, using sports competitions like marathons, boxing, and football as a real-world proving ground.",
      "Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics, the company that supplied the robot players, said sports competitions offer the ideal testing ground for humanoid robots, helping to accelerate the development of both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.",
      "He also emphasized safety as a core concern in the application of humanoid robots.",
      "\u201cIn the future, we may arrange for robots to play football with humans. That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cFor example, a robot and a human could play a match where winning doesn\u2019t matter, but real offensive and defensive interactions take place. That would help audiences build trust and understand that robots are safe.\u201d",
      "Booster Robotics provided the hardware for all four university teams, while each school\u2019s research team developed and embedded their own algorithms for perception, decision-making, player formations, and passing strategies\u2014including variables such as speed, force, and direction, according to Cheng.",

      "A tech industry trade group has sued Arkansas over two new law placing limits on content on social media platforms",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A tech industry trade group sued Arkansas Friday over two new laws that would place limits on content on social media platforms and would allow parents of children who killed themselves to sue over content on the platforms.",
      "The lawsuit by NetChoice filed in federal court in Fayetteville, Arkansas, comes months after a federal judge struck down a state law requiring parental consent before minors can create new social media accounts. The new laws were signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders earlier this year.",
      "\u201cDespite the overwhelming consensus that laws like the Social Media Safety Act are unconstitutional, Arkansas elected to respond to this Court\u2019s decision not by repealing the provisions that it held unconstitutional but by instead doubling down on its overreach,\u201d NetChoice said in its lawsuit.",
      "Arkansas is among several states that have been enacting restrictions on social media, prompted by concerns about the impact on children's mental health. NetChoice \u2014 whose members include TikTok, Facebook parent Meta, and the social platform X \u2014 challenged Arkansas' 2023 age-verification law for social media. A federal judge who initially blocked the law struck it down in March.",
      "Similar laws have been blocked by judges in Florida and Georgia.",
      "A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the latest complaint and looked forward to defending the law.",
      "One of the new laws being challenged prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm or feature it \u201cknows or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care\u201d would cause a user to kill themself, purchase a controlled substance, develop an eating disorder, develop an addiction to the platform.",
      "The lawsuit said that provision is unconstitutionally vague and doesn't offer guidance on how to determine which content would violate those restrictions, and the suit notes it would restrict content for both adults and minors. The suit questions whether songs that mention drugs, such as Afroman's \u201cBecause I Got High,\u201d would be prohibited under the new law.",
      "The law being challenged also would allow parents whose children have died by suicide or attempted to take their lives to sue social media companies if they were exposed to content promoting or advancing self-harm and suicide. The companies could face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.",
      "NetChoice is also challenging another law that attempts to expand Arkansas' blocked restrictions on social media companies. That measure would require social media platforms to ensure minors don't receive notifications between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.",
      "The measure also would require social media companies to ensure their platform \u201cdoes not engage in practices to evoke any addiction or compulsive behavior.\u201d The suit argues that the law doesn't explain how to comply with that restriction and is so broadly written that it's unclear what kind of posts or material would violate it.",
      "\u201cWhat is \u2018addictive\u2019 to some minors may not be addictive to others. Does allowing teens to share photos with each other evoke addiction?\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "In the time before widespread vaccination, young children often lost their lives to devastating infectious diseases that ran rampant in America",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- In the time before widespread vaccination, death often came early.",
      "Devastating infectious diseases ran rampant in America, killing millions of children and leaving others with lifelong health problems. These illnesses were the main reason why nearly one in five children in 1900 never made it to their fifth birthday.",
      "Over the next century, vaccines virtually wiped out long-feared scourges like polio and measles and drastically reduced the toll of many others. Today, however, some preventable, contagious diseases are making a comeback as vaccine hesitancy pushes immunization rates down. And well-established vaccines are facing suspicion even from public officials, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, running the federal health department.",
      "\u201cThis concern, this hesitancy, these questions about vaccines are a consequence of the great success of the vaccines \u2013 because they eliminated the diseases,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with the disease, you don\u2019t respect or even fear it. And therefore you don\u2019t value the vaccine.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine activists even portray the shots as a threat, focusing on the rare risk of side effects while ignoring the far larger risks posed by the diseases themselves \u2014 and years of real-world data that experts say proves the vaccines are safe.",
      "Some Americans know the reality of these preventable diseases all too well. For them, news of measles outbreaks and rising whooping cough cases brings back terrible memories of lives forever changed \u2013 and a longing to spare others from similar pain.",
      "With a mother\u2019s practiced, guiding hand, 80-year-old Janith Farnham helped steer her 60-year-old daughter\u2019s walker through a Sioux Falls art center. They stopped at a painting of a cow wearing a hat.",
      "Janith pointed to the hat, then to her daughter Jacque\u2019s Minnesota Twins cap. Jacque did the same.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so funny!\u201d Janith said, leaning in close to say the words in sign language too.",
      "Jacque was born with congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause a host of issues including hearing impairment, eye problems, heart defects and intellectual disabilities. There was no vaccine against rubella back then, and Janith contracted the viral illness very early in the pregnancy, when she had up to a 90% chance of giving birth to a baby with the syndrome.",
      "Janith recalled knowing \u201cthings weren\u2019t right\u201d almost immediately. The baby wouldn\u2019t respond to sounds or look at anything but lights. She didn\u2019t like to be held close. Her tiny heart sounded like it purred \u2013 evidence of a problem that required surgery at four months old.",
      "Janith did all she could to help Jacque thrive, sending her to the Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind and using skills she honed as a special education teacher. She and other parents of children with the syndrome shared insights in a support group.",
      "Meanwhile, the condition kept taking its toll. As a young adult, Jacque developed diabetes, glaucoma and autistic behaviors. Eventually, arthritis set in.",
      "Today, Jacque lives in an adult residential home a short drive from Janith's place. Above her bed is a net overflowing with stuffed animals. On a headboard shelf are photo books Janith created, filled with memories like birthday parties and trips to Mount Rushmore.",
      "Jacque\u2019s days typically begin with an insulin shot and breakfast before she heads off to a day program. She gets together with her mom four or five days a week. They often hang out at Janith\u2019s townhome, where Jacque has another bedroom decorated with her own artwork and quilts Janith sewed for her. Jacque loves playing with Janith\u2019s dog, watching sports on television and looking up things on her iPad.",
      "Janith marvels at Jacque\u2019s sense of humor, gratefulness, curiosity and affectionate nature despite all she\u2019s endured. Jacque is generous with kisses and often signs \u201cdouble I love yous\u201d to family, friends and new people she meets.",
      "\u201cWhen you live through so much pain and so much difficulty and so much challenge, sometimes I think: Well, she doesn\u2019t know any different,\u201d Janith said.",
      "Given what her family has been through, Janith believes younger people are being selfish if they choose not to get their children the MMR shot against measles, mumps and rubella.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more than frustrating. I mean, I get angry inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what can happen, and I just don\u2019t want anybody else to go through this.\u201d",
      "More than half a century has passed, but Patricia Tobin still vividly recalls getting home from work, opening the car door and hearing her mother scream. Inside the house, her little sister Karen lay unconscious on the bathroom floor.",
      "It was 1970, and Karen was 6. She\u2019d contracted measles shortly after Easter. While an early vaccine was available, it wasn\u2019t required for school in Miami where they lived. Karen\u2019s doctor discussed immunizing the first grader, but their mother didn't share his sense of urgency.",
      "\u201cIt's not that she was against it,\" Tobin said. \"She just thought there was time.\u201d",
      "Then came a measles outbreak. Karen \u2013 who Tobin described as a \u201cvery endearing, sweet child\u201d who would walk around the house singing \u2013 quickly became very sick. The afternoon she collapsed in the bathroom, Tobin, then 19, called the ambulance. Karen never regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cShe immediately went into a coma and she died of encephalitis,\u201d said Tobin, who stayed at her bedside in the hospital. \u201cWe never did get to speak to her again.\u201d",
      "Today, all states require that children get certain vaccines to attend school. But a growing number of people are making use of exemptions allowed for medical, religious or philosophical reasons. Vanderbilt\u2019s Schaffner said fading memories of measles outbreaks were exacerbated by a fraudulent, retracted study claiming a link between the MMR shot and autism.",
      "The result? Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very upset by how cavalier people are being about the measles,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that they realize how destructive this is.\u201d",
      "One of Lora Duguay\u2019s earliest memories is lying in a hospital isolation ward with her feverish, paralyzed body packed in ice. She was three years old.",
      "\u201cI could only see my parents through a glass window. They were crying and I was screaming my head off,\u201d said Duguay, 68. \u201cThey told my parents I would never walk or move again.\u201d",
      "It was 1959 and Duguay, of Clearwater, Florida, had polio. It mostly preyed on children and was one of the most feared diseases in the U.S., experts say, causing some terrified parents to keep children inside and avoid crowds during epidemics.",
      "Given polio's visibility, the vaccine against it was widely and enthusiastically welcomed. But the early vaccine that Duguay got was only about 80% to 90% effective. Not enough people were vaccinated or protected yet to stop the virus from spreading.",
      "Duguay initially defied her doctors. After intensive treatment and physical therapy, she walked and even ran \u2013 albeit with a limp. She got married, raised a son and worked as a medical transcriptionist.",
      "But in her early 40s, she noticed she couldn\u2019t walk as far as she used to. A doctor confirmed she was in the early stages of post-polio syndrome, a neuromuscular disorder that worsens over time.",
      "One morning, she tried to stand up and couldn\u2019t move her left leg.",
      "After two weeks in a rehab facility, she started painting to stay busy. Eventually, she joined arts organizations and began showing and selling her work. Art \"gives me a sense of purpose,\u201d she said.",
      "These days, she can't hold up her arms long enough to create big oil paintings at an easel. So she pulls her wheelchair up to an electric desk to paint on smaller surfaces like stones and petrified wood.",
      "The disease that changed her life twice is no longer a problem in the U.S. So many children get the vaccine \u2014 which is far more effective than earlier versions \u2014 that it doesn't just protect individuals but it prevents occasional cases that arrive in the U.S. from spreading further. \u201c Herd immunity \" keeps everyone safe by preventing outbreaks that can sicken the vulnerable.",
      "Every night, Katie Van Tornhout rubs a plaster cast of a tiny foot, a vestige of the daughter she lost to whooping cough at just 37 days old.",
      "Callie Grace was born on Christmas Eve 2009 after Van Tornhout and her husband tried five years for a baby. She was six weeks early but healthy.",
      "\u201cShe loved to have her feet rubbed,\" said the 40-year-old Lakeville, Indiana mom. \"She was this perfect baby.\u201d",
      "When Callie turned a month old, she began to cough, prompting a visit to the doctor, who didn\u2019t suspect anything serious. By the following night, Callie was doing worse. They went back.",
      "In the waiting room, she became blue and limp in Van Tornhout\u2019s arms. The medical team whisked her away and beat lightly on her back. She took a deep breath and giggled.",
      "Though the giggle was reassuring, the Van Tornhouts went to the ER, where Callie\u2019s skin turned blue again. For a while, medical treatment helped. But at one point she started squirming, and medical staff frantically tried to save her.",
      "\u201cWithin minutes,\u201d Van Tornhout said, \u201cshe was gone.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout recalled sitting with her husband and their lifeless baby for four hours, \"just talking to her, thinking about what could have been.\u201d",
      "Callie\u2019s viewing was held on her original due date \u2013 the same day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called to confirm she had pertussis, or whooping cough. She was too young for the Tdap vaccine against it and was exposed to someone who hadn\u2019t gotten their booster shot.",
      "Today, next to the cast of Callie\u2019s foot is an urn with her ashes and a glass curio cabinet filled with mementos like baby shoes.",
      "\u201cMy kids to this day will still look up and say, \u2018Hey Callie, how are you?\u2019\u201d said Van Tornhout, who has four children and a stepson. \u201cShe\u2019s part of all of us every day.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout now advocates for childhood immunization through the nonprofit Vaccinate Your Family. She also shares her story with people she meets, like a pregnant customer who came into the restaurant her family ran saying she didn\u2019t want to immunize her baby. She later returned with her vaccinated four-month-old.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s up to us as adults to protect our children \u2013 like, that\u2019s what a parent\u2019s job is,\u201d Van Tornhout said. \u201cI watched my daughter die from something that was preventable \u2026 You don\u2019t want to walk in my shoes.\u201d",

      "Ticks can be active in any season and experts say it\u2019s important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ticks can be active in any season and it's important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible \u2014 especially after you've been outside hiking, gardening or enjoying nature.",
      "\u201cHumans are outside more in summer so we hear about more tick infections,\u201d said Sam Telford, an infectious diseases expert at Tufts University. But he urges caution year-round because \u201cevery season is tick season.\u201d",
      "While tick populations vary a lot regionally, some Northeastern states including Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are seeing \u201cabove average\u201d numbers of American dog ticks this year, said Telford.",
      "And New York state is seeing a higher number of reported deer tick bites this year than last year, said Saravanan Thangamani, who studies tick-borne diseases at SUNY Upstate Medical University.",
      "Ticks, like mosquitos, need to feed on blood. But instead of a quick prick, they are slow feeders \u2013 with hooked mouth parts that attach into the skin of deer, rabbits, dogs and people.",
      "There are many different species of ticks found globally and only some spread germs that can make people sick. A main worry is blacklegged ticks, also called deer ticks, which can spread Lyme disease. Once found mainly in New England and pockets of the Midwest, the ticks are now present over a wider range.",
      "A tick bite doesn't always lead to illness. \u201cIf you remove a tick within 24 hours of attachment, it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you will get infected,\u201d said Telford.",
      "Ticks are usually found low to the ground, in leaf litter or grassy areas.",
      "Check your clothing for ticks and do a full-body check including under the arms and behind ears, knees and hair.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re out all day long, try to do a quick check for ticks every few hours,\u201d said Bobbi Pritt at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWhen you go back inside, take a shower. That will wash off any unattached ticks, and you\u2019re also more likely to spot any other ticks.\"",
      "Use tweezers to remove the tick and grasp it as close to the skin as possible to pull from the head. If you don\u2019t have them handy, you can also use your fingernails, the edge of a credit card or any semi-sharp object.",
      "The best approach is to minimize tick exposure altogether.",
      "Bug sprays containing ingredients such as DEET can be sprayed on exposed skin to ward off ticks and mosquitos, said Telford.",

      "Apple has moved to revamp its European Union app store policies as it seeks to fend off escalating fines under the 27-nation bloc\u2019s digital competition regulations",
      "LONDON -- Apple has revamped its app store policies in the European Union with hopes of fending off escalating fines under the 27-nation bloc's digital competition regulations.",
      "It's a last-minute bid by the iPhone maker to avoid further charges following a 500 million euro ($585 million) penalty in April. The bloc's executive Commission punished Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store, and gave it a 60-day deadline, which expired Thursday, to avoid additional, periodic fines.",
      "The changes made by Apple will make it easier for app makers to point users to better deals on digital products and options to pay for them outside of Apple's own App Store, including other websites, apps or alternative app stores.",
      "The California company is also rolling out a two-tier system of fees to accommodate app developers that want to use alternative payments.",
      "\u201cThe European Commission is requiring Apple to make a series of additional changes to the App Store,\" Apple said in a statement. \"We disagree with this outcome and plan to appeal.\u201d",
      "The commission noted Apple\u2019s announcement and \u201cwill now assess these new business terms for DMA compliance,\u201d referring to the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act. The rulebook was designed to rein in the power of big tech companies under threat of hefty fines worth up to 10% of a company's global annual revenue.",
      "Among the DMA\u2019s provisions are requirements that developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options, and direct them to those offers.",
      "Apple's restrictions preventing developers from steering users to outside payment channels had been fiercely opposed by some companies. It's the reason, for example, Spotify removed the in-app payment option to avoid having to pay a commission of up to 30% on digital subscriptions bought through iOS.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge sided with Facebook parent Meta Platforms in dismissing a copyright infringement lawsuit from a group of authors who accused the company of stealing their works to train its artificial intelligence technology.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria was the second in a week from San Francisco's federal court to dismiss major copyright claims from book authors against the rapidly developing AI industry.",
      "Chhabria found that 13 authors who sued Meta \u201cmade the wrong arguments\u201d and tossed the case. But the judge also said that the ruling is limited to the authors in the case and does not mean that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials is lawful.",
      "\u201cThis ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,\u201d Chhabria wrote. \u201cIt stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs \u2014 a group of well-known writers that includes comedian Sarah Silverman and authors Jacqueline Woodson and Ta-Nehisi Coates \u2014 said in a statement that the \"court ruled that AI companies that \u2018feed copyright-protected works into their models without getting permission from the copyright holders or paying for them\u2019 are generally violating the law. Yet, despite the undisputed record of Meta\u2019s historically unprecedented pirating of copyrighted works, the court ruled in Meta\u2019s favor. We respectfully disagree with that conclusion.\u201d",
      "Meta said it appreciates the decision.",
      "\u201cOpen-source AI models are powering transformative innovations, productivity and creativity for individuals and companies, and fair use of copyright material is a vital legal framework for building this transformative technology,\u201d the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "Although Meta prevailed in its request to dismiss the case, it could turn out to be a pyrrhic victory. In his 40-page ruling, Chhabria repeatedly indicated reasons to believe that Meta and other AI companies have turned into serial copyright infringers as they train their technology on books and other works created by humans, and seemed to be inviting other authors to bring cases to his court presented in a manner that would allow them to proceed to trial.",
      "The judge scoffed at arguments that requiring AI companies to adhere to decades-old copyright laws would slow down advances in a crucial technology at a pivotal time. \"These products are expected to generate billions, even trillions of dollars for the companies that are developing them. If using copyrighted works to train the models is as necessary as the companies say, they will figure out a way to compensate copyright holders for it.\u201d",
      "On Monday, from the same courthouse, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that AI company Anthropic didn\u2019t break the law by training its chatbot Claude on millions of copyrighted books, but the company must still go to trial for illicitly acquiring those books from pirate websites instead of buying them.",
      "But the actual process of an AI system distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "In the Meta case, the authors had argued in court filings that Meta is \u201cliable for massive copyright infringement\u201d by taking their books from online repositories of pirated works and feeding them into Meta's flagship generative AI system Llama.",
      "Lengthy and distinctively written passages of text \u2014 such as those found in books \u2014 are highly useful for teaching generative AI chatbots the patterns of human language. \u201cMeta could and should have paid\u201d to buy and license those literary works, the authors' attorneys argued.",
      "Meta countered in court filings that U.S. copyright law \u201callows the unauthorized copying of a work to transform it into something new\u201d and that the new, AI-generated expression that comes out of its chatbots is fundamentally different from the books it was trained on.",
      "\"After nearly two years of litigation, there still is no evidence that anyone has ever used Llama as a substitute for reading Plaintiffs\u2019 books, or that they even could,\u201d Meta's attorneys argued.",
      "Meta says Llama won\u2019t output the actual works it has copied, even when asked to do so.",
      "\u201cNo one can use Llama to read Sarah Silverman\u2019s description of her childhood, or Junot Diaz\u2019s story of a Dominican boy growing up in New Jersey,\u201d its attorneys wrote.",
      "Accused of pulling those books from online \u201cshadow libraries,\" Meta has also argued that the methods it used have \u201cno bearing on the nature and purpose of its use\u201d and it would have been the same result if the company instead struck a deal with real libraries.",
      "Such deals are how Google built its online Google Books repository of more than 20 million books, though it also fought a decade of legal challenges before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "The authors' case against Meta forced CEO Mark Zuckerberg to be deposed, and has disclosed internal conversations at the company over the ethics of tapping into pirated databases that have long attracted scrutiny.",
      "\u201cAuthorities regularly shut down their domains and even prosecute the perpetrators,\u201d the authors' attorneys argued in a court filing. \"That Meta knew taking copyrighted works from pirated databases could expose the company to enormous risk is beyond dispute: it triggered an escalation to Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta executives for approval. Their gamble should not pay off.\u201d",
      "The named plaintiffs are Jacqueline Woodson, Richard Kadrey, Andrew Sean Greer, Rachel Louise Snyder, David Henry Hwang, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Laura Lippman, Matthew Klam, Junot Diaz, Sarah Silverman, Lysa TerKeurst, Christopher Golden and Christopher Farnsworth.",
      "Chhabria said in the ruling that while he had \u201cno choice\u201d but to grant Meta\u2019s summary judgment tossing the case, \u201cin the grand scheme of things, the consequences of this ruling are limited. This is not a class action, so the ruling only affects the rights of these 13 authors -- not the countless others whose works Meta used to train its models.\u201d",

      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters searching through the debris of Russia's nightly assault on their cities found a drone that was different to the rest",
      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters picking up the debris from Russia\u2019s nightly assault on their cities found a weapon that stood out from the rest.",
      "It had an advanced camera, a computing platform powered by artificial intelligence and a radio link, allowing an operator to pilot it remotely from Russia. It also contained new, Iranian-made, anti-jamming technology, according to a Ukrainian drone expert.",
      "Most Russian attack drones are black, said Serhii Beskrestnov, an electronics expert more widely known as Flash. The new one, he told The Associated Press, was white.",
      "Inside, there were no markings or labels consistent with Russian-made drones. Instead, the stickers followed a \u201cstandard Iran labeling system,\u201d Beskrestnov said.",
      "Experts who spoke to AP said the labels are not conclusive proof but the English-language words are consistent with how Iran marks its drones. It is quite possible, they said, that it was sold by Iran to Russia to test in combat.",
      "Moscow has pummeled Ukraine almost nightly with Iranian-designed drones throughout the course of the war, now in its fourth year. They swarm above Ukrainian cities, their moped-like sound filling the air, as air defenses and sharpshooters take aim. While some carry warheads, many are decoys.",
      "Russia is improving its drone technology and tactics, striking Ukraine with increasing success. But the U.K's Defense Ministry said Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran will \u201clikely negatively impact the future provision of Iranian military equipment to Russia,\" since Tehran had supplied \u201csignificant quantities\u201d of attack drones to Moscow.",
      "Israel\u2019s military would not comment on what it struck. Although it has carried out sweeping attacks across Iranian military facilities and the U.S. bombed nuclear sites, the impact on Iran\u2019s drone industry is not yet clear.",
      "The anti-jammer in the latest drone discovered in Ukraine contained new Iranian technology, suggested Beskrestnov. Other components in Russia's drones often come from Russia, China and the West.",
      "Although Russia's drones are based on an Iranian design, the majority are now made in Russia.",
      "And because much of the technology to make them, including the Iranian software and technical expertise, has already been transferred to Russia, the immediate impact on Moscow\u2019s drone program could be limited, experts said.",
      "However, if Israel struck facilities producing drones and components \u2014 such as engines and anti-jamming units \u2014 which are shipped to Russia, then Moscow could face supply shortages, experts suggested.",
      "Moscow makes its Shahed \u2014 meaning \u201cwitness\u201d in Farsi \u2014 drones based on an Iranian model in a highly secure factory in central Russia.",
      "The Alabuga plant in the Tatarstan region took delivery of its first Iranian drones in 2022 after Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal. It later established its own production lines, churning out thousands of them.",
      "The upgrades identified from debris in Ukraine are the latest in a series of innovations that began with Russia buying drones directly from Iran in the fall of 2022, according to leaked documents from Alabuga previously reported on by AP.",
      "In early 2023, Iran shipped about 600 disassembled drones to be reassembled in Russia before production was localized. In 2024, the design was adapted.",
      "Specialists added cameras to some drones and implemented a plan, revealed in an AP investigation, dubbed Operation False Target \u2014 creating decoys to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.",
      "Alabuga also modified the Shahed to make it more lethal, creating a thermobaric drone which sucks out all the oxygen in its path \u2014 potentially collapsing lungs, crushing eyeballs and causing brain damage. The size of the warhead was also upgraded.",
      "In at least one case, Iran shipped a jet-powered Shahed that Russia \u201cexperimented\u201d with in Ukraine, said Fabian Hinz, an expert on Russian and Iranian drones at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force found two more examples of jet-powered Shaheds in May but it appears they have not been widely adopted.",
      "That\u2019s possibly because the Iranian design uses a very sophisticated jet engine that also powers Iran\u2019s cruise missiles, Hinz said. That likely makes it too expensive to use nightly in Ukraine, he said, even if the engine is swapped to a cheaper Chinese model.",
      "The electronics in the drone most recently found in Ukraine are also very expensive, Beskrestnov said, pointing to its AI computing platform, camera and radio link. It\u2019s unclear why it was deployed but Beskrestnov suggested it could be used to target \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d including electrical transmission towers.",
      "Previous versions of the Shahed drone could not hit a moving object or change their flight path once launched. They sometimes ended up \u201ctraveling in circles all through Ukraine before they finally hit a target,\u201d which made them easier to shoot down, said David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security.",
      "The radio link means an operator can communicate with the drone from Russia, introduce a new target and potentially control many drones at the same time, the experts said.",
      "The remotely operable Shahed has similarities to drones Russia is already using on the front lines and is particularly resistant to jamming, Beskrestnov said.",
      "There are eight, rather than four, antennas on the drone which means it is harder for Ukraine to overwhelm it with electronic warfare, he said.",
      "The new drone has markings that suggest the anti-jamming unit was made in Iran within the past year and similarities to Iranian components found in older models of the Shahed, said Beskrestnov.",
      "Such advanced antennas, said Hinz, have not previously been seen on drones used in Ukraine but have been found on Iranian missiles destined for Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "In a statement, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense told AP in the past four months it had found drones with eight and 12 antennas made in China and Russia.",
      "Despite sanctions, both Russia and Iran have continued to find ways to procure Western technology.",
      "The drone\u2019s AI computing platform can help it autonomously navigate if communications are jammed. Similar technology was used by Ukraine to attack aircraft deep inside Russia during Operation Spiderweb, when it used drones to target Russian air bases hosting nuclear-capable strategic bombers.",
      "Russia is improving its technology at the same time as it is also changing its tactics.",
      "Moscow is flying the Shahed drones at high altitudes where they are out of reach of Ukrainian shooters, as well as lower down to avoid radio detection.",
      "It is also carrying out massive group attacks on cities including where drones sometimes dive-bomb a target, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said.",
      "The drones can be used to clear a path for cruise missiles or to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses by sending a wave of decoys followed by one or two with a warhead.",
      "The tactics appear to be working.",
      "AP collected almost a year\u2019s worth of Russian drone strike data on Ukraine posted online by the Ukrainian air force.",
      "An analysis shows that Russia significantly ramped up its attacks after U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January. And Russian hits have increased markedly since March \u2014 shortly before reports emerged that Russia was using Shahed drones with advanced jammers.",
      "In November 2024, only around 6% of drones hit a discernible target but, by June, that reached about 16%. On some nights, almost 50% of drones got through Ukraine\u2019s air defenses.",
      "Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said the Shaheds' effectiveness is likely because Russia is firing more drones, including decoys, as well as the change in technology and tactics.",
      "But although Russia appears to have had increasing success striking Ukraine, it is not clear if that will continue.",
      "Israel's strikes on Iran will \u201ccertainly\u201d hurt Russia long-term, Albright said.",
      "Moscow, he said, is \u201cnot going to be able to get as much assistance from Iran as it has been.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "This story has been corrected to show only around 6% of drones hit a discernible target in November 2024, not November 2022.",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "Associated Press journalists Lydia Doye in London, Volodymyr Yurchuk and Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine, and Sam Mednick in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this report.",

      "Hackers backing Iran have targeted U.S. banks, defense contractors and oil industry companies following American strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities",
      "WASHINGTON -- Hackers backing Tehran have targeted U.S. banks, defense contractors and oil industry companies following American strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities \u2014 but so far have not caused widespread disruptions to critical infrastructure or the economy.",
      "But that could change if the ceasefire between Iran and Israel collapses or if independent hacking groups supporting Iran make good on promises to wage their own digital conflict against the U.S., analysts and cyber experts say.",
      "The U.S. strikes could even prompt Iran, Russia, China and North Korea to double down on investments in cyberwarfare, according to Arnie Bellini, a tech entrepreneur and investor.",
      "Bellini noted that hacking operations are much cheaper than bullets, planes or nuclear arms \u2014 what defense analysts call kinetic warfare. America may be militarily dominant, he said, but its reliance on digital technology poses a vulnerability.",
      "\u201cWe just showed the world: You don\u2019t want to mess with us kinetically,\u201d said Bellini, CEO of Bellini Capital. \u201cBut we are wide open digitally. We are like Swiss cheese.\"",
      "Two pro-Palestinian hacking groups claimed they targeted more than a dozen aviation firms, banks and oil companies following the U.S. strikes over the weekend.",
      "The hackers detailed their work in a post on the Telegram messaging service and urged other hackers to follow their lead, according to researchers at the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks the groups' activity.",
      "The attacks were denial-of-service attacks, in which a hacker tries to disrupt a website or online network.",
      "\u201cWe increase attacks from today,\u201d one of the hacker groups, known as Mysterious Team, posted Monday.",
      "Federal authorities say they are on guard for additional attempts by hackers to penetrate U.S. networks.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security issued a public bulletin Sunday warning of increased Iranian cyber threats. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a statement Tuesday urging organizations that operate critical infrastructure like water systems, pipelines or power plants to stay vigilant.",
      "While it lacks the technical abilities of China or Russia, Iran has long been known as a \u201cchaos agent\u201d when it comes to using cyberattacks to steal secrets, score political points or frighten opponents.",
      "Cyberattacks mounted by Iran's government may end if the ceasefire holds and Tehran looks to avoid another confrontation with the U.S. But hacker groups could still retaliate on Iran's behalf.",
      "In some cases, these groups have ties to military or intelligence agencies. In other cases, they act entirely independently. More than 60 such groups have been identified by researchers at the security firm Trustwave.",
      "These hackers can inflict significant economic and psychological blows. Following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, for instance, hackers penetrated an emergency alert app used by some Israelis and directed it to inform users that a nuclear missile was incoming.",
      "\u201cIt causes an immediate psychological impact,\" said Ziv Mador, vice president of security research at Trustwave's SpiderLabs, which tracks cyberthreats.",
      "Economic disruption, confusion and fear are all the goals of such operations, said Mador, who is based in Israel. \u201cWe saw the same thing in Russia-Ukraine.\u201d",
      "While Iran lacks the cyberwarfare capabilities of China or Russia, it has repeatedly tried to use its more modest operations to try to spy on foreign leaders \u2014 something national security experts predict Tehran is almost certain to try again as it seeks to suss out President Donald Trump\u2019s next moves.",
      "Last year, federal authorities charged three Iranian operatives with trying to hack Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. It would be wrong to assume Iran has given up those efforts, according to Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency cybersecurity expert who is now vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy, a Washington-based cybersecurity firm.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fairly certain that these limited resources are being used for intelligence collection to understand what Israel or the U.S. might be planning next, rather than performing destructive attacks against U.S. commercial organizations,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Calls to bolster America's digital defense come as the Trump administration has moved to slash some cybersecurity programs as part of its effort to shrink the size of government.",
      "CISA has placed staffers who worked on election security on leave and cut millions of dollars in funding for cybersecurity programs for local and state elections.",
      "The CIA, NSA and other intelligence agencies also have seen reductions in staffing. Trump abruptly fired Gen. Timothy Haugh, who oversaw the NSA and the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command.",
      "The Israel-Iran conflict shows the value of investments in cybersecurity and cyber offense, Mador said. He said Israel's strikes on Iran, which included attacks on nuclear scientists, required sophisticated cyberespionage that allowed Israel to track its targets.",
      "Expanding America's cyber defenses will require investments in education as well as technical fixes to ensure connected devices or networks aren't vulnerable, said Bellini, who recently contributed $40 million toward a new cybersecurity center at the University of South Florida.",
      "There is a new arms race when it comes to cyberwar, Bellini said, and it's a contest America can't afford to lose.",
      "\u201cIt's Wile E. Coyote vs. the Road Runner,\u201d Bellini said. \"It will go back and forth, and it will never end.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- It is often said music is the universal language of humanity. Now a 12-year-old Houston boy is putting that to the test among an unlikely audience \u2014 man's best friend.",
      "Yuvi Agarwal started playing keyboard when he was 4 and several years ago noticed his playing soothed his family's restless golden doodle, Bozo. He grew curious if it also could help stressed homeless animals.",
      "With help from his parents, who both have backgrounds in marketing, he founded the nonprofit Wild Tunes in 2023 to recruit musicians to play in animal shelters. So far he has enlisted about 100 volunteer musicians and singers of all ages and abilities to perform at nine shelters in Houston, New Jersey and Denver.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand the lyrics to enjoy the music. Just enjoy the melody, the harmony and the rhythms. So it transcends linguistic barriers, and even it can just transcend species,\u201d Agarwal said recently after playing hits like The Beatles' \u201cHey Jude\u201d and Ed Sheeran's \u201cPerfect\u201d on his portable keyboard at the Denver Animal Shelter.",
      "Agarwal, who was playing for an elderly miniature poodle named Pituca \u2014 Spanish slang sometimes used to describe a snob \u2014 said many of his four-legged listeners, which include cats, become excited when he enters their kennel. But after a few minutes of playing, they calm down. Some even go to sleep.",
      "He remembers a rescue dog named Penelope that refused to come out of her enclosure in Houston to be fed.",
      "\u201cWithin a short period of me playing, she went from not even coming out of her kennel to licking me all over my face and nibbling my ears,\u201d Agarwal said.",
      "A few stalls down from where he was jamming on his keyboard at the Denver shelter, volunteer Sarah McDonner played Mozart and Bach on her flute for Max, a 1-year-old stray boxer that tilted his head when she hit the high notes.",
      "\u201cThe animals having that human interaction in a positive way, I think, gives them something to look forward to, something that is different throughout their day,\u201d said McDonner, a professional musician who met Argawal in Houston.",
      "She helped bring the program to Colorado after moving to Denver a few months ago. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to give them something different from what they\u2019re used to in their little tiny cages ... and makes them more adoptable in the long run,\u201d McDonner said.",
      "While the effect of music on humans has been studied extensively, its role in animal behavior remains murky.",
      "Several studies suggest that classical music generally has a calming influence on dogs in stressful environments like kennels, shelters and veterinary clinics. But some researchers warn there is not enough data to support the claim.",
      "\u201cWe always want these really simplistic answers. So we want to say that music calms animals, for example, and I think that it\u2019s much more nuanced than that,\u201d said Lori Kogan, a self-described \u201cdog-person\" who chairs the human-animal interaction section of the American Psychological Association. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more research that needs to happen before I think that we can unequivocally say that music is a great thing for animals.\"",
      "Kogan, a professor and researcher at Colorado State University, has studied for more than two decades how animals and humans get along. Research involving the effect of music on dogs often produces mixed results, she said, because there are so many variables: the setting; the volume, type and tempo of the music and the breed of the dog and its previous exposure to music.",
      "She suggests a case-by-case approach to introducing music to animals.",
      "\u201cIf you play music for your pet, and they seem to like it and they appear calmer, then I think we can say that that\u2019s a positive thing, that you\u2019re providing some level of enrichment for that pet. ... I would encourage people to give it a try and to see how their pets respond,\u201d she said.",
      "For Agarwal, his firsthand experience at shelters is undeniable evidence that music helps comfort stressed animals, and he plans to grow Wild Tunes into a nationwide program. The volunteers get something out of it, too, he said.",
      "\"You get a really great way to practice your instrument or sing in front of a nonjudgmental audience, which can boost your confidence,\u201d he said.",

      "Defense tech hackathons are attracting engineering students, tech industry workers and hobbyists to solve military challenges",
      "SANDHURST, England -- Hunched over laptops, the team of four raced to solve a challenge: how to get a set of drones to fly themselves from one place to another when GPS and other signals are jammed by an enemy.",
      "Elsewhere around the hall, groups of people \u2014 engineering students, tech workers and hobbyists \u2014 gathered around long tables to brainstorm, write computer code or tinker with more drones and other hardware.",
      "Most of them were strangers when they first gathered last month at Britain's Sandhurst Military Academy to compete in a 24-hour \u201chackathon\" focused on defense technology. Many were drawn to the event because they wanted to use their technical skills to work on one of the biggest challenges confronting Europe: the continent's race to beef up its military capabilities as Russia's war in Ukraine threatens to widen global instability.",
      "\u201cGiven the geopolitical climate, defense tech is relevant now more than ever,\u201d said Aniketh Ramesh, a startup founder with a Ph.D. in robotics in extreme environments and one of the drone team members. The hackathon, he said, \u201cis a good place to sort of go and contribute your ideas.\u201d",
      "\u201cRobotics and drones are having their iPhone moment\" because costs have come down and the hardware is widely available, Ramesh said. That means building drones to do new things is more a \u201cthinking challenge\" than a technical one, he said.",
      "Ramesh already knew one teammate, a former British army paratrooper, from a previous event. They recruited two others \u2014 one engineer and one with a Ph.D. in computer vision \u2014 through the event\u2019s group chat on Signal.",
      "The drone problem was just one of the many challenges the teams could choose to solve. The tasks were proposed by defense startups like German drone maker Helsing and robotics company Arx, the British military and Kyiv-based venture capital firm D3.",
      "Some worked on software, such as an algorithm to predict which way a target would move. Others came with their own ideas. One team made a plastic cup packed with sensors that could be produced in large amounts to be scattered across a battlefield. Another team built a scale model of an autonomous medical evacuation aircraft.",
      "Similar competitions have been held regularly across Europe since last year, inspired by the Ukrainian military\u2019s on-the-fly wartime innovations to fend off the larger Russian army.",
      "The grassroots meetups are part of a wider network of defense innovation that organizers hope to foster in Europe, underscoring the continent's scramble to churn out weapons that have been turbocharged by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s persistent threats to withdraw from the NATO trans-Atlantic security alliance.",
      "The idea is to \u201cgo build a prototype, take your prototype to become a product, and go build a company\u201d that can \u201cdeliver stuff to the frontline and hopefully save someone\u2019s life,\u201d said Benjamin Wolba, who organizes a separate but similar series, the European Defense Tech Hackathon.",
      "Wolba's group has held tournaments in about 10 cities in the past twelve months, including one in Lviv, Ukraine, in May, and has scheduled more this year in Sheffield, England; Gothenburg, Sweden; Marseilles, France; London; and Berlin.",
      "The European Union-backed EUDIS Defence Hackathon holds simultaneous competitions at eight universities twice a year. Meanwhile, NATO has launched DIANA, an \u201caccelerator\u201d program to speed up defense innovations.",
      "The competitions are producing real-world results. The winners of one European Defense Tech Hackathon were a team of Bulgarian high school students who came up with a de-mining solution that they used to found a startup.",
      "At last year\u2019s London event, the winning team devised an idea for an anti-drone system. They went to Ukraine for more testing, and then were bought by a startup that went on to raise millions in venture capital funding, said Richard Pass, co-founder of the London hackathon.",
      "This year, instead of a trophy, some London teams signed term sheets with investors.",
      "Hackathons have their origins in the software industry. Small teams of programmers and developers are pitted against each other in marathon brainstorming sessions to write programs that could become new products.",
      "\u201cThe beauty of the hackathon is you get a mixture of people who never normally meet,\u201d said Wolba. \u201cEngineers are \u201cpaired with actual investors who understand something on the commercial side, but also, critically, military end users.\u201d",
      "Organizers want to foster a culture of nimble startups to join Europe's defense ecosystem, traditionally dominated by a handful of big \u201cprime\u201d military contractors such as Britain's BAE, Germany's Rheinmetall and France's Thales that are focused on building pricey hardware.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a shift in the industry from the purchase of more exquisite, high-cost capabilities, such as fighter jets, or submarines, or expensive tanks, towards more low-cost systems that can give you scale advantages,\u201d said Pass.",
      "A recent aerial confrontation between Pakistan and India further highlights how Europe is at risk of losing its edge against adversaries, he said.",
      "Pass said reports that Pakistan used Chinese-made fighter jets armed with Chinese air-to-air missiles to down Indian air force planes, including three French-made Rafale jets, came as a big surprise.",
      "Not only does it show \u201ctechnological parity between the Chinese and leading Western industrial nations like France,\u201d but it also hints at China's advantages in mass-producing fighter jets that could overwhelm Western forces, he said.",
      "Fostering a broader European defense tech start-up ecosystem is a way \u201cto regain that technological advantage,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense tech startup founders can ride a wave of investment as Europe moves to beef up its military capabilities. Leaders of NATO, which includes 30 European nations, are meeting this week to endorse a goal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense.",
      "The European Union has sought to mobilize 800 billion euros ($927 billion) to boost the 27-nation bloc's defense, with priorities including drones, AI, autonomous systems and quantum computing.",
      "Britain, which left the EU, has meanwhile pledged to spend 10% of its defense budget on new technologies.",
      "Europe still has a long way to go. The continent's defense tech startup ecosystem is young and about five years behind the United States, consulting firm McKinsey said in a recent report. But it's growing rapidly as investors flock there. Venture capital investment in Europe's defense tech sector for 2021-2024 more than quadrupled from the previous three-year period, according to Pitchbook.",
      "At the London hackathon, teams worked into the evening, fueled by chocolate bars, energy drinks, fruit and a late-night pizza delivery. Army cots were available for those who wanted to catch a few hours of sleep.",
      "Soldiers in camouflage and defense company reps hovered on the sidelines to provide advice and answer questions.",
      "Andrii Solonskyi, CEO of Soloma Avionics, which fielded a team, said defense hackathons are \u201ca bit of a novelty.\u201d",
      "The industry has traditionally been more structured and formal, because \u201cit\u2019s a serious business and there\u2019s a lot of things that can go wrong,\u201d he said. But, \"what we definitely feel is that you can be very agile in defense right now.\"",

      "When asked on Tuesday about a possible interest rate cut at the Fed's meeting this month, Powell said, \"I wouldn't take any meeting off the table or put any on the table. It depends on how the data evolve.\"",
      "Speaking on a panel at the European Central Bank forum in Sinatra, Portugal, Powell deflected a question from the moderator about challenges posed by Trump's barbed criticism.",
      "\"I'm very focused on just doing my job,\" Powell said, drawing applause. The central bank remains \"100% focused\" on its dual mandate of controlling inflation and delivering maximum employment, Powell added.",

      "Nari Rhee, director of the Retirement Security Program at the UC Berkeley Labor Center and author of the analysis, told ABC News that after age 50, employment becomes increasingly difficult.",
      "For instance, many older workers become physically unable to continue employment until they reach retirement age.",
      "\"Most people hope and plan to retire at something like age 65, but life happens and quite often what happens is people start having health issues,\" Rhee said. \"If you've had blue collar work or manual work, often you started working probably in your late teens. And so, by the time you get into your 50s, your late 50s, your body is just really worn out, and you're not no longer able to work the kinds of jobs that you used to do.\"",
      "She added that some older workers who are physically unable to do the jobs they used to do or who were laid off have a hard time finding employment again due to age discrimination.",
      "Additionally, many older adults are responsible for caring for family members including spouses and parents, which may mean leaving the workplace entirely.",
      "\"In practical terms, there are all kinds of legitimate reasons why, especially older adults, might not be able to meet the work requirements in terms of actually putting in the number of hours, and that's before we even get to all the administrative issues,\" Rhee said. \"Even if you do work, you might not be able to navigate the red tape.\"",

Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressing opposition to a provision that would disqualify people who fail to meet Medicaid work requirements from receiving Affordable Care Act premium tax credits.",

      "Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurse Association, said cuts to Medicaid could force rural hospitals and community health centers to close.",
      "Although Senate Republicans have proposed a $25 billion rural health stabilization fund due to cuts to the Medicaid provider tax, it is unclear if that will be enough to prevent hospitals from closing.",
      "Many rural health care centers receive revenue from patients covered by Medicaid and losing that revenue could be costly.",
      "\"These hospitals have been on the verge of tight finances for years, and this could be enough to shut them down,\" Mensik Kennedy told ABC News. \"If we have cuts to Medicaid, we're going to see these hospitals start to shutter their doors, and people are going to have to drive three, four, hours to deliver a baby, to go have emergency care to get seen, and that's got to be unacceptable to everyone.\"",
      "Arnulfo De La Cruz, president of SEIU 2015, the nation's largest long-term care union and California's largest labor union, concurred, saying cuts to Medicaid would impact states' ability to provide health coverage and long-term care, particularly for rural and low-income Americans.",
      "\"Any cuts to Medicaid, the impact in California would be devastating \u2026 Medicaid is really the core of how the long-term care system is structured and funded,\" he told ABC News. \"Medicaid helps to fund clinics, hospitals, nursing homes, home care -- it's all connected as part of our health delivery system. If you were to dismantle or cut to the extent that they're talking about, I think you see clinics close, you see hospitals close, you see nursing homes close.\"",

      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- A federal judge has ruled that recent mass layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services were likely unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to halt plans to downsize and reorganize the nation's health workforce.",
      "U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose granted the preliminary injunction sought by a coalition of attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit filed in early May.",
      "DuBose said the states had shown \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d from the cuts and were likely to prevail in their claims that \u201cHHS\u2019s action was both arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe executive branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,\u201d DuBose wrote in a 58-page order handed down in U.S. district court in Providence.",
      "Her order blocks the Trump administration from finalizing layoffs announced in March or issuing any further firings. HHS is directed to file a status report by July 11.",
      "The ruling applies to terminated employees in four different divisions of HHS: the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Center for Tobacco Products within the Food and Drug Administration; the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families and employees of regional offices who work on Head Start matters; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. eliminated more than 10,000 employees in late March and consolidated 28 agencies to 15. Since then, agencies including the CDC have repeatedly rescinded layoffs affecting hundreds of employees, including in branches that monitor HIV, hepatitis and other diseases.",
      "The attorneys general argued that the massive restructuring was arbitrary and outside of the scope of the agency's authority. The lawsuit also says the action decimated essential programs and pushed burdensome costs onto states.",
      "\u201cThe intended effect \u2026 was the wholesale elimination of many HHS programs that are critical to public health and safety,\u201d the lawsuit argued.",
      "The cuts are part of a federal \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d directive to streamline costly agencies and reduce redundancies. Kennedy told senators at a May 14 hearing that there is \u201cso much chaos and disorganization\" at HHS.",
      "But the restructuring had eliminated key teams that regulate food safety and drugs, as well as support a wide range of programs for tobacco, HIV prevention and maternal and infant health. Kennedy has since said that because of mistakes, 20% of people fired might be reinstated.",

    "summary": "President Trump said his mass deportations would target criminals -- but new data shows a recent shift toward also arresting those who have not been accused of crimes.",
    "story": [
      "ICE is arresting more and more migrants who have not been accused of crimes.",
      "President Donald Trump campaigned for president on the promise of mass deportations that targeted criminals -- and while ICE agents have arrested over 38,000 migrants with criminal convictions, new data shows a recent shift toward also arresting those who have not been accused of crimes.",
      "In recent weeks, the Trump administration has arrested an increasing number of migrants with no criminal convictions, according to an ABC News analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement data.",
      "The numbers, which were obtained through a public records lawsuit and released by the Deportation Data Project at the University of California Berkeley, give the first real glimpse of how Trump's immigration enforcement policy is playing out in the streets.",
      "Over the first five months of the Trump administration, ICE has arrested over 95,000 individuals, according to data analyzed by ABC's owned television stations' data team.",
      "At the start of the administration, ICE tended to target migrants with pending or criminal convictions. From Inauguration Day to May 4, 2025, 44% of those arrested had a criminal conviction, while 34% of those arrested had pending charges and 23% had no criminal history, according to the data.",
      "But beginning May 25, the data appears to show there was a shift in enforcement -- with individuals with criminal convictions making up only 30% of those arrested. Those arrested with pending criminal charges accounted for 26% of the individuals arrested and 44% had no criminal history.",
      "\"It looks like there's been a shift from about Memorial Day this year up until now, to an increasing number of people who have been detained who have no criminal charges,\" said Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who reviewed the data.",
      "\"We hear a lot about the administration deporting the worst of the worst. And as far as we can tell from all available data up to this point, the data has not really supported that,\" Kocher said.",
      "The data is largely divided into three groups of individuals: those who have criminal convictions, those with pending charges, and those who may be facing civil immigration charges, labeled as \"other immigration violators.\" However, the data provides no indication of what kind of crimes the individuals may be accused or convicted of.",
      "In Los Angeles, where ICE raids recently sparked large demonstrations, and in the New York City area, almost 60% of those arrested by ICE in the first ten days of June had no criminal convictions nor any pending criminal charges, according to the data.",
      "Asked about the shift, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told ABC News, \"We are not going to disclose law enforcement sensitive intelligence and methods. 70% of the arrests ICE made were of criminal illegal aliens.\"",
      "\"We are continuing to go after the worst of the worst -- including gang members, pedophiles, and rapists,\" McLaughlin said. \"Under Secretary [Kristi] Noem, we are delivering on President Trump's and the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe.\"",
      "The majority of administration's migrant arrests have taken place in Texas, the state with the longest southern border. But the data also shows that enforcement has largely shifted away from apprehensions at the southern border to apprehensions in the interior of the country.",
      "John Sandweg, the former acting director of ICE under President Barack Obama, told ABC News that the shift in enforcement is not a surprise, considering that illegal border crossings are down dramatically.",
      "\"For the last probably 15 years at least, the majority of ICE arrests, people booked into ICE custody or ICE apprehensions, were individuals apprehended at the border. But now, the administration is very sensitive to the numbers and has started putting ICE under pressure,\" Sandweg said, referring to Trump's call for more migrants to be deported.",
      "\"The problem is that you are now engaged in operations that are, frankly, more likely to find non-criminals than criminals,\" Sandweg said.",
      "As ABC News previously reported, ICE's latest tactic has been arresting individuals at immigration courts. In most cases, when a deportation case is dismissed, it is a positive outcome for a migrant, attorneys told ABC News -- but according to immigration attorneys and advocates, immigration enforcement officers have been waiting in immigration court buildings and coordinating with DHS lawyers to arrest migrants promptly after their cases are dismissed, after which the migrants are placed into expedited removal proceedings without allowing them to fight their case.",
      "\"If there's anything that says this isn't about serious criminal enforcement, it's this wholesale dismissal of cases of the people who are showing up in immigration court,\" Sandweg said. \"I mean, you want to find the place where you're least likely to find dangerous criminals -- it's the people who show up for their immigration court hearings.\"",
      "Sandweg said these new types of enforcement, including courthouse arrests, are being made in an effort to achieve quotas set by the Trump administration.",
      "\"It's another way to just quickly make some arrests,\" Sandweg said.",
      "The administration, meanwhile, says it's continuing its efforts to target accused criminals.",
      "At a press conference on Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said federal authorities have arrested 2,711 alleged multinational gang members since Trump re-took office in January.",
      "\"You should all feel safer that President Trump can deport all of these gangs and not one district court judge can think they're emperor over this Trump administration and his executive powers,\" she said.",

      "Trump has emphasized that he believes Americans support his bill as emblematic of the agenda he campaigned on. He told reporters at a promotional event on Thursday, \"Almost every major promise made in the 2024 campaign already will have become a promise kept. That's very important.\"",
      "A wide-ranging Quinnipiac University poll published on Thursday that was taken in late June found that a small majority of registered voters oppose the bill, but are more split on a provision that would create new requirements to be insured through Medicaid.",

      "A smaller plurality of voters \u2013 49% \u2013 told Fox News they think the legislation will hurt their families, while 23% said it would help and 26% said it would make no difference.",

But at that time, 34% of American adults said they had no opinion about it, and separately, 66% said they had heard only a little or nothing at all about the bill.",

      "The Pew Research Center, in an early June poll, also found around half \u2013 49% \u2013 of Americans opposing the bill and 29% supporting it. Separately, 54% of Americans also felt the bill would have a \"mostly negative effect on the country,\" while 3 in 10 felt it would have a \"mostly positive effect.\"",

      "The French city of Cannes is banning cruise ships carrying over 1,000 passengers from its harbor starting next year",
      "PARIS -- The French Riviera resort of Cannes is imposing what its city council calls \u201cdrastic regulation\u201d on cruise ships, banning any vessels carrying more than 1,000 people from its harbor starting next year.",
      "The home of the world's premier film festival is joining a growing global backlash against overtourism, which recently saw uproar over Jeff Bezos\u2019 and Lauren Sanchez' Venice wedding this weekend, water-gun protests in Spain and a surprise strike at the Louvre Museum.",
      "\u201cLess numerous, less big, less polluting and more esthetic\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s the aim of Cannes city councilors who voted Friday to introduce new limits on cruise ships in its ports starting Jan. 1. Only ships with fewer than 1,000 passengers will be allowed in the port, with a maximum of 6,000 passengers disembarking per day. Larger ships will be expected to transfer passengers to smaller boats to enter Cannes.",
      "France \u2014 which drew in some 100 million visitors last year, more than any other European country and more than the country\u2019s population \u2014 is on the front line of efforts to balance economic benefits of tourism with environmental concerns while managing ever-growing crowds.",
      "\u201cCannes has become a major cruise ship destination, with real economic benefits. It\u2019s not about banning cruise ships, but about regulating, organizing, setting guidelines for their navigation,\u201d Mayor David Lisnard said in a statement.",
      "Cruise operators have called such restrictions damaging for destinations and for passengers.",
      "Two cruise ships were scheduled to dock in Cannes on Sunday, each bigger than the upcoming 1,000-passenger limit and with a combined capacity of more than 7,000 people. Their owners did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new restrictions.",
      "The nearby Mediterranean city of Nice announced limits on cruise ships earlier this year, as have some other European cities.",

      "Group and solo travelers are trickling into Afghanistan by plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles",
      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- By plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles, tourists are beginning to discover Afghanistan, with solo travelers and tour groups gradually venturing into a country that until recently was wracked by war.",
      "And the country\u2019s Taliban government, which seized power more than three years ago but has yet to be formally recognized by any other nation, is more than happy to welcome them.",
      "\u201cThe Afghan people are warm and welcoming and wish to host tourists from other countries and engage with them,\u201d Deputy Minister of Tourism Qudratullah Jamal told The Associated Press in an early June interview. \u201cTourism brings many benefits to a country. We have considered those benefits and aim for our nation to take full advantage of them.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a vital, multi-billion-dollar industry for many countries.",
      "Afghanistan\u2019s isolation on the international stage, largely because of the Taliban\u2019s restrictions on women and girls, has left much of its 41 million people mired in poverty. As it struggles to attract foreign investment, the lucrative potential of tourism is far from lost on the government.",
      "\u201cWe are currently earning a considerable amount of revenue from this industry, and we are hopeful it will grow even more in the future,\u201d Jamal said, noting money spent by visitors can reach more layers of society than revenue from other industries. \u201cWe are optimistic this sector will evolve into a large economy, bringing significant benefits. It plays an important role in strengthening our national economy.\u201d",
      "Tourist visas are quick and easy to obtain and flights from major transit hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul operate several times a week. The government has even set up a training institute for men \u2014 and it is only for men \u2014 seeking jobs in the hospitality and tourism sector.",
      "While visitor numbers are still very much a trickle rather than a flood, they are increasing. Nearly 9,000 foreign tourists visited Afghanistan last year, while nearly 3,000 people visited in the first three months of this year, Jamal said.",
      "Four decades of near-continuous conflict kept nearly all vacationers away from this landlocked country of towering mountains, deep gorges and millennia of history.",
      "The Taliban\u2019s takeover from a U.S.-backed government in August 2021 stunned the world and sent thousands of Afghans fleeing. But with the insurgency over, the bloodshed from frequent bombings and suicide attacks all but ended too.",
      "Attacks still occur, however. An Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan remains active and gunmen killed six people, including three Spanish tourists, in a May 2024 attack in Bamiyan, one of the country\u2019s main tourist attractions where centuries-old giant Buddhas carved into the cliffs were blown up by the Taliban in 2001.",
      "While Western countries still advise against travel to Afghanistan, a drop in violence from the two decades of U.S.-led military presence is indisputable, as the government is keen to point out.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan has gone through many years of war and hardship. Now, we want tourists to come and see the true traditions and customs of Afghans, to understand Afghan life, creativity and resilience,\u201d Jamal said, noting there was \u201ccomprehensive security across Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Critics question the ethics of foreigners visiting Afghanistan for pleasure when its government discriminates so heavily against half the country\u2019s population.",
      "Education beyond primary school level is banned for girls and women and few professions are open to them. Women cannot enter parks, gardens or gyms.",
      "Beauty salons are forbidden. Authorities dictate how women dress and have demanded they cover their faces in public, a decree still flouted by many, particularly in Kabul.",
      "Some visitors say they contemplated the ethics, but ultimately wanted to see the situation for themselves.",
      "French-Peruvian Illary Gomez said she and her British partner, James Liddiard, debated for about a year whether to drive through Afghanistan as part of their U.K.-to-Japan camper van journey.",
      "\u201cSome things didn\u2019t feel morally right,\u201d she said.",
      "But once here, they said they found a warm, hospitable and welcoming people and beautiful landscapes. They didn\u2019t feel their presence was any form of support for the Taliban.",
      "By traveling, \u201cyou put money in the hands of the people, not the government,\u201d Liddiard said.",
      "The treatment of women is particularly sensitive for government officials. Jamal declined to comment on the subject beyond saying male and female visitors were welcome.",
      "\u201cThose who respect our laws and traditions have already come and can continue to come,\u201d he said.",
      "While most restrictions are strictly enforced on Afghan women, they are far more relaxed for foreigners. Although they must still wear a headscarf in public, foreign women are more likely to gain entry into some restricted areas such as parks and are rarely asked to cover their faces in public.",
      "Opening the country to foreign visitors was also a way of building bridges, Jamal said.",
      "\u201cIt is a great way to promote interaction between the people of different countries. It helps build international relations and is also beneficial for trade,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cWhen foreigners come here, Afghans also learn a lot from them. In addition to expanding commerce, tourism also helps foster mutual understanding, cultural exchange and strengthens talents as people learn from one another.\u201d",
      "A foreign traveler seeing the country with his own eyes \u201ccreates closeness, builds connections and fosters trust among people,\u201d Jamal said. \u201cThey will respect each other\u2019s culture and the distance between peoples will diminish.",
      "\u201cSo this is not just economic development; it also brings spiritual and political benefits,\u201d he said.",

      "A federal appeals court has ruled Alabama prosecutors violated the constitutional rights of a man sentenced to death in 1990",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- A federal appeals court ruled Alabama prosecutors violated the constitutional rights of a man sentenced to death in 1990, saying Blacks were rejected from the jury during his trial.",
      "The Monday ruling from a three judge panel on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals means Michael Sockwell, 62, is eligible for a retrial. He was convicted of killing former Montgomery County Sheriff Isaiah Harris in 1988 when he was 26-years old.",
      "The panel issued a 2-1 opinion stating Alabama prosecutors violated Sockwell's 14th Amendment rights by \u201crepeatedly and purposefully\u201d rejecting potential Black jurors who were believed to be more sympathetic to him on the basis of their shared race.",
      "Prosecutors said Harris' wife hired Sockwell to kill Harris because she wanted to cover up an affair she was having and collect Harris' insurance money. There were no witnesses to the shooting. Sockwell, whose attorneys say has a low IQ that disqualifies him from the death penalty, initially told authorities in a videotaped confession that he killed Harris. At his trial, Sockwell testified that officers threatened to beat and kill him before he confessed and deprived him of food and water.",
      "Sockwell then testified that another man, who was having an affair with Harris' wife, committed the killing. Sockwell also denied he ever received money to kill Harris.",
      "The jury voted 7-5 to sentence Sockwell to life in prison, but the judge overruled the decision and sentenced Sockwell to death. Alabama no longer allows a judge to override a jury\u2019s sentence in capital cases.",
      "Attorneys for Sockwell appealed the decision, arguing the prosecutors unconstitutionally used race as the basis for jury selection, rejecting 80% of the Black jurors who were eligible for Sockwell's trial \u2014 compared to only 20% white jurors who were disqualified. The appeal cited notes from the prosecutor that rejected one juror who she described as \u201ca (B)lack male, approximately twenty-three years of age, which would put him very close to the same race, sex, and age of\u201d Sockwell.",
      "Judge Robert J. Luck, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, dissented. Luck emphasized that the prosecutor noted the race of white potential jurors too, a fact Luck said indicated race was not a disqualifying factor for jurors in Sockwell\u2019s case.",
      "The opinion, written by former President Bill Clinton-appointed Judge Charles Wilson, also cited four other cases in the years leading up to Sockwell's case where the state prosecutor appeared to have illegally rejected Black jurors based solely on their race, demonstrating a \u201cpattern\u201d of choosing juries with \u201cdiscriminatory intent.\u201d",
      "The Alabama Attorney General's Office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment Tuesday morning.",
      "Luck disputed that the prosecutor had a pattern of discrimination and said 17% of the jury in Sockwell's trial was Black out of a jury pool that was 24% Black to begin with. ___",

      "Jimmy Swaggart, the televangelist whose multimillion-dollar ministry was crippled by his encounters with prostitutes, has died",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who became a household name amassing an enormous following and multimillion-dollar ministry only to be undone by his penchant for prostitutes, has died.",
      "Swaggart died decades after his once vast audience dwindled and his name became a punchline on late night television. His death was announced Tuesday on his public Facebook page. A cause wasn't immediately given, though at 90 he had been in poor health.",
      "The Louisiana native was best known for being a captivating Pentecostal preacher with a massive following before being caught on camera with a prostitute in New Orleans in 1988, one of a string of successful TV preachers brought down in the 1980s and \u201990s by sex scandals. He continued preaching for decades, but with a reduced audience.",
      "Swaggart encapsulated his downfall in a tearful 1988 sermon, in which he wept and apologized but made no reference to his connection to a prostitute.",
      "\u201cI have sinned against you,\u201d Swaggart told parishioners nationwide. \u201cI beg you to forgive me.\u201d",
      "He announced his resignation from the Assemblies of God later that year, shortly after the church said it was defrocking him for rejecting punishment it had ordered for \u201cmoral failure.\u201d The church had wanted him to undergo a two-year rehabilitation program, including not preaching for a full year.",
      "Swaggart said at the time that he knew dismissal was inevitable but insisted he had no choice but to separate from the church to save his ministry and Bible college.",
      "Swaggart grew up poor, the son of a preacher, in a music-rich family. He excelled at piano and gospel music, playing and singing with talented cousins who took different paths: rock-'n'-roller Jerry Lee Lewis and country singer Mickey Gilley.",
      "In his hometown of Ferriday, Louisiana, Swaggart said he first heard the call of God at age 8. The voice gave him goose bumps and made his hair tingle, he said.",
      "\u201cEverything seemed different after that day in front of the Arcade Theater,\u201d he said in a 1985 interview with the Jacksonville Journal-Courier in Illinois. \u201cI felt better inside. Almost like taking a bath.\u201d",
      "He preached and worked part time in oil fields until he was 23. He then moved entirely into his ministry: preaching, playing piano and singing gospel songs with the barrelhouse fervor of cousin Lewis at Assemblies of God revivals and camp meetings.",
      "Swaggart started a radio show, a magazine, and then moved into television, with outspoken views.",
      "He called Roman Catholicism \u201ca false religion. It is not the Christian way,\u201d and claimed that Jews suffered for thousands of years \u201cbecause of their rejection of Christ.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don't like what I say, talk to my boss,\u201d he once shouted as he strode in front of his congregation at his Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, where his sermons moved listeners to speak in tongues and stand up as if possessed by the Holy Spirit.",
      "Swaggart's messages stirred thousands of congregants and millions of TV viewers, making him a household name by the late 1980s. Contributors built Jimmy Swaggart Ministries into a business that made an estimated $142 million in 1986.",
      "His Baton Rouge complex still includes a worship center and broadcasting and recording facilities.",
      "Swaggart\u2019s downfall came in the late 1980s as other prominent preachers faced similar scandals. Swaggart said publicly that his earnings were hurt in 1987 by the sex scandal surrounding rival televangelist Jim Bakker and a former church secretary at Bakker's PTL ministry organization.",
      "The following year, Swaggart was photographed at a hotel with Debra Murphree, an admitted prostitute who told reporters that the two did not have sex but that the preacher had paid her to pose nude.",
      "She later repeated the claim \u2014 and posed nude \u2014 for Penthouse magazine.",
      "The surveillance photos that crippled Swaggart's career apparently stemmed from his rivalry with preacher Marvin Gorman, whom Swaggart had accused of sexual misdeeds. Gorman hired the photographer who captured Swaggart and Murphree on film. Swaggart later paid Gorman $1.8 million to settle a lawsuit over the sexual allegations against Gorman.",
      "More trouble came in 1991, when police in California detained Swaggart with another prostitute. The evangelist was charged with driving on the wrong side of the road and driving an unregistered Jaguar. His companion, Rosemary Garcia, said Swaggart became nervous when he saw the police car and weaved when he tried to stuff pornographic magazines under a car seat.",
      "Swaggart was later mocked by the late TV comic Phil Hartman, who impersonated him on NBC's \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d",
      "The evangelist largely stayed out of the news in later years but remained in the pulpit at Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, often joined by his son, Donnie, a fellow preacher. His radio station broadcast church services and gospel music to 21 states, and Swaggart\u2019s ministry boasted a worldwide audience on the internet.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been no greater example of a good and faithful servant than my father. No ifs, ands and buts about it. A man who lived his life for the cause of Christ,\u201d Donnie Swaggart said in a video message shared on social media Sunday about his dad\u2019s final days.",
      "The preacher caused another brief stir in 2004 with remarks about being \u201clooked at\u201d amorously by a gay man.",
      "\u201cAnd I'm going to be blunt and plain: If one ever looks at me like that, I'm going to kill him and tell God he died,\u201d Jimmy Swaggart said, to laughter from the congregation. He later apologized.",
      "Swaggart made few public appearances outside his church, save for singing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d at the 2005 funeral of Louisiana Secretary of State Fox McKeithen, a prominent name in state politics for decades.",
      "In 2022, he shared memories at the memorial service for Lewis, his cousin and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll pioneer. The pair had released \u201cThe Boys From Ferriday,\u201d a gospel album, earlier that year.",

      "The Ford Foundation has announced Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken as its next president",
      "NEW YORK -- The Ford Foundation has settled on its next leader.",
      "Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken will succeed Darren Walker as the president of one of the largest U.S. charitable organizations, the Ford Foundation announced Monday. A leading expert on constitutional law and democracy, Gerken takes the helm of its $16 billion endowment as the philanthropic sector navigates challenges to the tax-exempt status of nonprofits opposed by President Donald Trump's administration and its sweeping orders targeting trillions of dollars in federal funding for civil society groups.",
      "\u201cI am deeply grateful for this opportunity and look forward to working with Ford staff and the board of trustees to protect democracy and the rule of law and further our mission to create a more just and fair world for everyone,\" Gerken said in a statement.",
      "Gerken brings an extensive legal background that includes voting rights experience at Washington, DC law firm Jenner & Block and clerkships with Supreme Court justices. The Ford Foundation noted that she prioritized increasing access for underrepresented students as the dean of Yale Law School. She is also a trustee of Princeton University, where she completed her bachelor\u2019s degree, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.",
      "Her tenure begins in November, making good on Walker\u2019s promise last year to exit the stage by the end of 2025. She called it a \u201cprofound honor\u201d to build upon the legacy of those who preceded her, \u201cparticularly the astonishing Darren Walker.\u201d Since 2013, Walker has focused the foundation\u2019s mission around social justice and overseen major investments in gender equity and disability rights.",
      "\u201cHer experience and dedication to philanthropy and the field of law will undoubtedly propel the foundation\u2019s mission forward,\" Walker said in a statement.",
      "The Ford Foundation was created in 1936 by the brothers Henry and Edsel Ford, pioneers of the automobile, and funded with stock in the Ford company. It supported civil rights litigation starting in the late 1960s and helped seed the field of public interest law in the United States.",
      "Before becoming vice president, then-Sen. J.D. Vance called out the Ford Foundation specifically for supporting progressive causes and accused them of using charitable funds for partisan ends.",

    "summary": "Attorney General Pam Bondi&rsquo;s comments about evidence the Justice Department is reviewing from its Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation have fueled anticipation about the expected release of more files related to the New York financier",
    "story": [
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s comments about evidence the Justice Department is reviewing from its Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation have fueled anticipation about the expected release of more files related to the New York financier",
      "WASHINGTON -- It was a surprising statement from Attorney General Pam Bondi as the Trump administration promises to release more files from its sex trafficking investigation of Jeffrey Epstein: The FBI, she said, was reviewing \u201ctens of thousands of videos\u201d of the wealthy financier \u201cwith children or child porn.\u201d",
      "The comment, made to reporters at the White House days after a similar remark to a stranger with a hidden camera, raised the stakes for President Donald Trump's administration to prove it has in its possession previously unseen compelling evidence. That task is all the more pressing after an earlier document dump that Bondi hyped angered elements of Trump\u2019s base by failing to deliver new bombshells and as administration officials who had promised to unlock supposed secrets of the so-called government \u201cdeep state\" struggle to fulfill that pledge.",
      "Yet weeks after Bondi\u2019s remarks, it remains unclear what she was referring to.",
      "The Associated Press spoke with people involved as lawyers or law enforcement officials in criminal cases of Epstein and socialite former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell who said they hadn't seen and didn't know of a trove of recordings like what Bondi described. Indictments and detention memos do not reference the existence of videos of Epstein with children, and neither was charged with possession of child sex abuse material even though that offense would have been much easier to prove than the sex trafficking counts they faced.",
      "One potential clue may lie in a little-noticed 2023 court filing \u2014 among hundreds of documents reviewed by the AP \u2014 in which Epstein\u2019s estate was revealed to have located an unspecified number of videos and photos that it said might contain child sex abuse material. But even that remains shrouded in secrecy with lawyers involved in that civil case saying a protective order prevents them from discussing it.",
      "The filing suggests a discovery of recordings after the criminal cases had concluded, but if that's what Bondi was referencing, the Justice Department has not said.",
      "The department declined repeated requests from the AP to speak with officials overseeing the Epstein review. Spokespeople did not answer a list of questions about Bondi\u2019s comments, including when and where the recordings were procured, what they depict and whether they were newly discovered as authorities dug through their evidence collection or were known for some time to have been in the government's possession.",
      "\u201cOutside sources who make assertions about materials included in the DOJ\u2019s review cannot speak to what materials are included in the DOJ\u2019s review,\u201d spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said in a statement.",
      "Epstein\u2019s crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a coverup. Elon Musk entered the frenzy during his acrimonious fallout with Trump when he said without evidence in a since-deleted social media post that the reason the Epstein files have yet to be released is that the Republican president is featured in them.",
      "During a Fox News Channel interview in February, Bondi suggested an alleged Epstein \u201cclient list\u201d was sitting on her desk. The next day, the Justice Department distributed binders marked \u201cdeclassified\u201d to far-right influencers at the White House, but it quickly became clear much of the information had long been in the public domain. No \u201cclient list\u201d was disclosed, and there\u2019s no evidence such a document exists.",
      "The flop left conservatives fuming and failed to extinguish conspiracy theories that for years have spiraled around Epstein's case. Right wing-personality Laura Loomer called on Bondi to resign, branding her a \u201ctotal liar.\"",
      "Afterward, Bondi said an FBI \u201csource\u201d informed her of the existence of thousands of pages of previously undisclosed documents and ordered the bureau to provide the \u201cfull and complete Epstein files,\" including any videos. Employees since then have logged hours reviewing records to prepare them for release. It\u2019s unclear when that might happen.",
      "In April, Bondi was approached in a restaurant by a woman with a hidden camera who asked about the status of the Epstein files release. Bondi replied that there were tens of thousands of videos \u201cand it\u2019s all with little kids,\" so she said the FBI had to go through each one.",
      "After conservative activist James O\u2019Keefe, who obtained and later publicized the hidden-camera video, alerted the Justice Department to the encounter, Bondi told reporters at the White House: \u201cThere are tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children or child porn.\u201d",
      "The comments tapped into long-held suspicions that, despite the release over the years of thousands of records documenting Epstein\u2019s activities, damaging details about him or other prominent figures remain concealed.",
      "The situation was further muddied by recent comments from FBI Director Kash Patel to podcaster Joe Rogan that did not repeat Bondi's account about tens of thousands of videos.",
      "Though not asked explicitly about Bondi, Patel dismissed the possibility of incriminating videos of powerful Epstein friends, saying, \u201cIf there was a video of some guy or gal committing felonies on an island and I\u2019m in charge, don\u2019t you think you\u2019d see it?\u201d Asked whether the narrative \u201cmight not be accurate that there\u2019s video of these guys doing this,\u201d he replied, \u201cExactly.\u201d",
      "Epstein\u2019s suicide in August 2019, weeks after his arrest, prevented a trial in New York and cut short the discovery process in which evidence is shared among lawyers.",
      "But even in a subsequent prosecution of Maxwell, in which such evidence would presumably have been relevant given the nature of the accusations against an alleged co-conspirator, salacious videos of Epstein with children never surfaced nor were part of the case, said one of her lawyers.",
      "\u201cWe were never provided with any of those materials. I suspect if they existed, we would have seen them, and I\u2019ve never seen them, so I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about,\u201d said Jeffrey Pagliuca, who represented Maxwell in a 2021 trial in which she was convicted of luring teenage girls to be molested by Epstein.",
      "To be sure, photographs of nude or seminude girls have long been known to be part of the case. Investigators recovered possibly thousands of such pictures while searching his Manhattan mansion, and a videorecorded walk-through by law enforcement of his Palm Beach, Florida, home revealed sexually suggestive photographs displayed inside, court records show.",
      "Accounts from more than one accuser of feeling watched or seeing cameras or surveillance equipment in Epstein's properties have contributed to public expectations of sexual recordings. A 2020 Justice Department Office of Professional Responsibility report on the handling of an earlier Epstein investigation hinted at that possibility, saying police who searched his Palm Beach home in 2005 found computer keyboards, monitors and disconnected surveillance cameras, but the equipment \u2014 including video recordings and other electronic items \u2014 was missing.",
      "There's no indication prosecutors obtained any missing equipment during the later federal investigation, and the indictment against him included no recording allegations.",
      "An AP review of hundreds of documents in the Maxwell and Epstein criminal cases identified no reference to tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with underage girls.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t recall personally ever having that kind of discussion,\u201d said one Epstein lawyer, Marc Fernich, who couldn't rule out such evidence wasn't located later. \u201cIt's not something I ever heard about.\u201d",
      "In one non-specific reference to video evidence, prosecutors said in a 2020 filing that they would produce to Maxwell\u2019s lawyers thousands of images and videos from Epstein\u2019s electronic devices in response to a warrant.",
      "But Pagliuca said his recollection was those videos consisted largely of recordings in which Epstein was \u201cmusing\u201d into a recording device \u2014 \u201cEpstein talking to Epstein,\u201d he said.",
      "Complicating efforts to assess the Epstein evidence is the volume of accusers, court cases and districts where legal wrangling has occurred, including after Epstein's suicide and Maxwell's conviction.",
      "The cases include 2022 lawsuits in Manhattan's federal court from an accuser identified as Jane Doe 1 and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein had a home, alleging that financial services giant JPMorgan Chase failed to heed red flags about him being a \u201chigh-risk\u201d customer.",
      "Lawyers issued a subpoena for any video recordings or photos that could bolster their case.",
      "They told a judge months later the Epstein estate had alerted them that it had found content that \u201cmight contain child sex abuse imagery\" while responding to the subpoena and requested a protocol for handling \"videorecorded material and photographs.\" The judge ordered representatives of Epstein\u2019s estate to review the materials before producing them to lawyers and to alert the FBI to possible child sexual abuse imagery.",
      "Court filings don't detail the evidence or say how many videos or images were found, and it's unclear whether the recordings Bondi referenced were the same ones.",
      "The estate's disclosure was later included by a plaintiffs' lawyer, Jennifer Freeman, in a complaint to the FBI and the Justice Department asserting that investigators had failed over the years to adequately collect potential evidence of child sex abuse material.",
      "Freeman cited Bondi's comments in a new lawsuit on behalf of an Epstein accuser who alleges he assaulted her in 1996. In an interview, Freeman said she had not seen recordings and had no direct knowledge but wanted to understand what Bondi meant.",
      "\u201cI want to know what she's addressing, what is she talking about \u2014 I'd like to know that,\" she said.",

      "Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republicans who control the state Legislature have reached a deal on a new two-year budget",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republicans who control the state Legislature announced a deal Tuesday on a new two-year budget that cuts income taxes, increases funding for the Universities of Wisconsin despite a threatened cut and raises taxes to pay for transportation projects.",
      "The deal in the battleground state, where Evers and Republicans have a long history of not working together, emerged the day after the deadline for enacting a new budget. However, there is no government shutdown in Wisconsin when the budget is late. The Legislature is scheduled to pass it this week.",
      "Evers called the deal \u201ca pro-kid budget that\u2019s a win for Wisconsin\u2019s kids, families, and our future.\u201d",
      "Here is what to know about Wisconsin's budget deal:",
      "Evers and Republicans agreed to $1.3 billion in income tax cuts largely targeting the middle class. More than 1.6 million people will have their taxes cut an average of $180 annually.",
      "The deal would expand the state's second lowest income tax bracket and make the first $24,000 of income for people age 67 and over tax-free. It also eliminates the sales tax on electricity, saving taxpayers about $156 million over two years.",
      "Republican legislative leaders praised the deal as providing meaningful tax relief to the middle class and retirees.",
      "\u201cThis budget delivers on our two biggest priorities: tax relief for Wisconsin and reforms to make government more accountable,\u201d Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said in a statement.",
      "And Senate Republican Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu praised it as a compromise that cuts taxes but also stabilizes the state's child care system and strengthens schools by increasing special education funding.",
      "The Universities of Wisconsin would see a $256 million increase over two years, the largest funding increase for the UW system in about two decades. UW Regents had asked for an $855 million overall increase and Republicans in June floated the possibility of an $87 million cut.",
      "The deal also imposes a faculty minimum workload requirement and calls for an independent study on the system\u2019s future sustainability.",
      "There will be $200 million in additional tax revenue to pay for transportation projects, but Evers and Republican leaders did not detail where that money would come from.",
      "The agreement increases funding for child care programs by $330 million over two years, a third of which will be direct payments to providers. The money will replace the Child Care Counts program started during the COVID-19 pandemic. That program, which provides funding to child care providers, expired on Monday. Evers, Democrats and child care advocates have been pushing for additional funding to address child care shortages throughout the state.",
      "Funding for K-12 special education programs will increase by $500 million.",
      "State employees, including at the university, would get a 3% raise this year and a 2% raise next year.",
      "The budget deal was reached after Republicans killed more than 600 Evers proposals in the budget, including legalizing marijuana, expanding Medicaid and raising taxes on millionaires.",
      "It is the first time the Legislature has missed the June 30 budget deadline since 2017. All three prior budgets passed by the Legislature since Evers has been governor were on time, until this one. Republicans have held the majority in the Legislature since 2011.",
      "Republicans negotiated more with Evers on this budget than the previous three when their majorities in the Senate and Assembly were larger. Democrats gained seats in November and are pushing to take majority control of at least one legislative chamber next year.",
      "Amid the ongoing talks last week, Assembly Republicans urged bipartisanship to reach a deal.",
      "The Legislature's budget-writing committee is scheduled to vote on the plan Tuesday. The full Legislature is set to meet starting Wednesday to give it final passage.",
      "Republicans hold a narrow 18-15 majority in the Senate, and with two GOP senators previously saying they planned to vote against the budget, some Democratic votes were expected to be needed to pass it.",
      "Once the budget clears the Legislature, Evers will be able to make changes using his expansive partial veto powers. But his office said Evers would not veto any budget provisions that were part of the deal he reached with Republicans.",
      "Evers, who is midway through his second term, has said he will announce his decision on whether to seek a third term after he has signed the budget. He has 10 business days to take action on the spending plan once the Legislature passes it.",

      "Vice President JD Vance has arrived at the Capitol as senators slog through a tense overnight session on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is slogging through a tense overnight session that has dragged into Tuesday, with Republican leaders searching for ways to secure support for President Donald Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts while fending off proposed amendments, mostly from Democrats trying to defeat the package.",
      "An endgame appeared to be taking shape. Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota spent the night reaching for last-minute agreements between those in his party worried the bill's reductions to Medicaid will leave millions without care and his most conservative flank, which wants even steeper cuts to hold down deficits ballooning with the tax cuts.",
      "Vice President JD Vance arrived at the Capitol, on hand to break a tie vote if needed.",
      "It's a pivotal moment for the Republicans, who have control of Congress and are racing to wrap up work with just days to go before Trump's holiday deadline Friday. The 940-page \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d as it\u2019s formally titled, has consumed Congress as its shared priority with the president.",
      "At the same time House Speaker Mike Johnson has signaled more potential problems ahead, warning the Senate package could run into trouble when it is sent back to the House for a final round of voting, as skeptical lawmakers are being called back to Washington ahead of Trump\u2019s Fourth of July deadline.",
      "In a midnight social media post urging them on, Trump called the bill \u201cperhaps the greatest and most important of its kind.\u201d Vice President JD Vance summed up his own series of posts, simply imploring senators to \u201cPass the bill.\u201d",
      "What started as a routine, but laborious day of amendment voting, in a process called vote-a-rama, spiraled into an almost round-the-clock marathon as Republican leaders were buying time to shore up support.",
      "The droning roll calls in the chamber belied the frenzied action to steady the bill. Grim-faced scenes played out on and off the Senate floor, and tempers flared.",
      "The GOP leaders have no room to spare, with narrow majorities in both chambers. Thune can lose no more than three Republican senators, and already two \u2014 Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who warns people will lose access to Medicaid health care, and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who opposes raising the debt limit by $5 trillion \u2014 have indicated opposition.",
      "Attention quickly turned to key senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, who have also wroked to stem the the health care cuts, but also a loose coalition of four conservative GOP senators pushing for even steeper reductions.",
      "Murkowski in particular was the subject of the GOP leadership's attention, as Thune and others sat beside her in conversation.",
      "Then all eyes were on Paul after he returned from a visit to Thune\u2019s office with a stunning offer that could win his vote. He had suggested substantially lowering the debt ceiling, according to two people familiar with the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.",
      "And on social media, billionaire Elon Musk was again lashing out at Republicans as \u201cthe PORKY PIG PARTY!!\u201d for including the $5 trillion debt limit provision, which is needed to allow continued borrowing to pay the bills.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said his side was working to show \u201chow awful this is.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans are in shambles because they know the bill is so unpopular,\u201d Schumer said as he walked the halls.",
      "A new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law. The CBO said the package would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the decade.",
      "Few Republicans appear fully satisfied as the final package emerges, in either the House or Senate.",
      "Collins had proposed bolstering the $25 billion proposed rural hospital fund to $50 billion, offset with a higher tax rate on those earning more than $25 million a year, but her amendment failed.",
      "And Murkowski was trying to secure provisions to spare people in her state from some food stamp cuts, which appeared to be accepted, while she was also working to beef up federal reimbursements to hospitals in Alaska and others states, that failed to comply with parliamentary rules.",
      "\u201cRadio silence,\u201d Murkowski said when asked how she would vote.",
      "At the same time, conservative Senate Republicans insisting on a vote on their plan for health care cuts, including Rick Scott of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, filed into Thune's office for a near-midnight meeting.",
      "A few of the amendments from Democrats were winning support from a few Republicans, though almost none were passing.",
      "One amendment was overwhelmingly approved, 99-1. It would strip a provision barring states from regulating artificial intelligence if they receive certain federal funding.",
      "All told, the Senate bill includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, according to the latest CBO analysis, making permanent Trump's 2017 rates, which would expire at the end of the year if Congress fails to act, while adding the new ones he campaigned on, including no taxes on tips.",
      "The Senate package would roll back billions of dollars in green energy tax credits, which Democrats warn will wipe out wind and solar investments nationwide. It would impose $1.2 trillion in cuts, largely to Medicaid and food stamps, by imposing work requirements on able-bodied people, including some parents and older Americans, making sign-up eligibility more stringent and changing federal reimbursements to states.",
      "Additionally, the bill would provide a $350 billion infusion for border and national security, including for deportations, some of it paid for with new fees charged to immigrants.",
      "Unable to stop the march toward passage, the Democrats as the minority party in Congress are using the tools at their disposal to delay and drag out the process.",
      "Democrats forced a full reading of the text, which took 16 hours, and they have a stream of amendments.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, raised particular concern at the start of debate late Sunday about the accounting method being used by the Republicans, which says the tax breaks from Trump's first term are now \u201ccurrent policy\u201d and the cost of extending them should not be counted toward deficits.",

      "The law also explicitly defines female and male based on reproductive organs at birth and removes the ability for people to change the sex designation on their birth certificate.",
      "An unprecedented take-back of legal rights after nearly two decades in Iowa code leaves transgender, nonbinary and potentially even intersex Iowans more vulnerable now than they were before. It's a governing doctrine now widely adopted by President Donald Trump and Republican-led states despite the mainstream medical view that sex and gender are better understood as a spectrum than as an either-or definition.",
      "When Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed Iowa\u2019s new law, she said the state\u2019s previous civil rights code \u201cblurred the biological line between the sexes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s common sense to acknowledge the obvious biological differences between men and women. In fact, it\u2019s necessary to secure genuine equal protection for women and girls,\u201d she said in a video statement.",
      "Also taking effect Tuesday are provisions in the state\u2019s health and human services budget that say Medicaid recipients are no longer covered for gender-affirming surgery or hormone therapy.",
      "Iowa\u2019s state Capitol filled with protesters as the law went through the Republican-controlled Legislature and to Reynolds\u2019 desk in just one week in February. Iowa Republicans said laws passed in recent years to restrict transgender students\u2019 use of bathrooms and locker rooms, and their participation on sports teams, could not coexist with a civil rights code that includes gender identity protections.",
      "About two dozen other states and the Trump administration have advanced restrictions on transgender people. Republicans say such laws and executive actions protect spaces for women, rejecting the idea that people can transition to another gender. Many face court challenges.",
      "About two-thirds of U.S. adults believe that whether a person is a man or woman is determined by biological characteristics at birth, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in May found. But there's less consensus on policies that target transgender and nonbinary people.",
      "Transgender people say those kinds of policies deny their existence and capitalize on prejudice for political gain.",
      "In a major setback for transgender rights nationwide, the U.S. Supreme Court last month upheld Tennessee\u2019s ban on puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors. The court\u2019s conservative majority said it doesn\u2019t violate the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same.",
      "Not every state includes gender identity in their civil rights code, but Iowa was the first to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank.",
      "Iowans will still have time to file a complaint with the state Office of Civil Rights about discrimination based on gender identity that occurred before the law took effect.",
      "State law requires a complaint to be submitted within 300 days after the most recent incident of alleged discrimination. That means people have until April 27 to file a complaint about discrimination based on gender identity, according to Kristen Stiffler, the office\u2019s executive director.",
      "Sixty-five such complaints were filed and accepted for investigation from July 2023 through the end of June 2024, according to Stiffler. Forty-three were filed and accepted from July 1, 2024, through June 19 of this year.",
      "Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl, a Democrat and the state\u2019s first openly transgender lawmaker, fears the law will lead to an increase in discrimination for transgender Iowans.",
      "\u201cAnytime someone has to check your ID and they see that the gender marker doesn\u2019t match the appearance, then that opens up hostility, discrimination as possibilities,\u201d Wichtendahl said, naming examples such as applying for a job, going through the airport, buying beer or getting pulled over in a traffic stop. \u201cThat instantly outs you. That instantly puts you on the spot.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination, but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes.",
      "Five years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled LGBTQ people are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace. But Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "The months between when the bill was signed into law and when it took effect gave transgender Iowans time to pursue amended birth certificates before that option was eliminated.",
      "Keenan Crow, with LGBTQ+ advocacy group One Iowa, said the group has long cosponsored legal clinics to assist with that process.",
      "\u201cThe last one that we had was by far the biggest,\u201d Crow said.",
      "Iowa\u2019s Department of Transportation still has a process by which people can change the gender designation on their license or identification card but has proposed administrative rules to eliminate that option.",
      "Wichtendahl also said she has talked to some families who are looking to move out of state as a result of the new law.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking because this is people\u2019s lives we\u2019re talking about,\" Wichtendahl added. \u201cThese are families that have trans loved ones and it\u2019s keeping their loved ones away, it\u2019s putting their loved ones into uncertain future, putting their health and safety at risk.\u201d",

      "Nearly 10,000 city workers in Philadelphia have gone on strike, halting trash collection and other services",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Nearly 10,000 city workers in Philadelphia who collect trash, answer 911 calls, maintain city pools and perform other jobs went on strike Tuesday after contract negotiations broke down.",
      "District Council 33 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees announced the strike on its Facebook page early Tuesday, saying \u201cHOLD THE LINES.\u201d",
      "Mayor Cherelle Parker said the city would suspend residential trash collection, close some city pools and shorten recreation center hours, but vowed to keep the city running. Police and firefighters are not on strike.",
      "Parker, a pro-labor Democrat, promised that Fourth of July celebrations in the nation\u2019s birthplace would go on as usual.",
      "\u201cKeep your holiday plans. Don\u2019t leave the city,\" she said at a Monday afternoon news conference that followed hours of last-minute negotiations.",
      "City officials urged residents to be patient and not hang up should they need to call either 911 or the city\u2019s non-emergency helpline. They said they would open drop-off sites for residential trash.",
      "Parker said she had offered raises that amount to 13% over her four-year term and added a fifth step to the pay scale to align with other unionized workers. District Council 33 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees is the largest of four unions representing city workers.",
      "\u201cWe believe it\u2019s a fair offer and still fiscally responsible for the people of this city,\u201d said Parker, who took office last year.",
      "Union leaders, in their initial contract proposal, asked for 8% annual raises each year of the three-year contract, along with cost-of-living hikes and bonuses of up to $5,000 for those who worked through the pandemic. The union also asked the city to pay the full cost of employee health care, or $1,700 per person per month.",
      "\u201cDistrict Council 33\u2019s members contribute as much blood, sweat and tears as does anyone else,\u201d they said in a demand letter. \u201cWe all make the city work. Our contract must reflect that reality.\u201d",
      "In November, the city transit system averted a strike when the parties agreed to a one-year contract with 5% raises.",

      "The winner of the New York City Democratic mayoral primary featuring progressive Zohran Mamdani and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo is likely to be finalized Tuesday when the city\u2019s board of elections announces the next round of results",
      "NEW YORK -- The winner of New York City\u2019s Democratic mayoral primary, between progressive Zohran Mamdani and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, is likely to be finalized Tuesday when the city\u2019s board of elections announces the next round of results.",
      "Mamdani already declared victory on election night last week after gaining a commanding lead over Cuomo, who swiftly conceded. But more results are needed to establish the victor due to the city's ranked choice voting model, which allows voters' second, third, fourth and even fifth preferences to be counted if their top candidate falls out of the running.",
      "The board is scheduled to run through its first tabulation at noon, which may be enough for Mamdani to clear the 50% threshold needed. If so, he would move on to the November election to face a field including incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and potentially Cuomo again, if the former governor decides to run on an independent ballot line.",
      "Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist and member of the state Assembly, was virtually unknown when he launched his candidacy centered on a bold slate of populist ideas. But he built an energetic campaign that ran circles around Cuomo as the older, more moderate Democrat tried to come back from the sexual harassment scandal that led to his resignation four years ago.",
      "The results, even before they were finalized, sent a shockwave through the political world.",
      "Mamdani\u2019s campaign, which was focused on lowering the cost of living, claims it has found a new blueprint for Democrats who have at times appeared rudderless during President Donald Trump's climb back to power.",
      "The Democratic establishment has approached Mamdani with caution. Many of its big players applauded his campaign but don't seem ready to throw their full support behind the young progressive, whose past criticisms of law enforcement, use of the word \u201cgenocide\u201d to describe the Israeli government\u2019s actions in Gaza and \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d label amount to landmines for some in the party.",
      "If elected, Mamdani would be the city's first Muslim mayor and its first of Indian American decent. He would also be one of its youngest.",
      "For Republicans, Mamdani has already provided a new angle for attack. Trump and others in the GOP have begun to launch broadsides at him, moving to cast Mamdani as the epitome of leftist excess ahead of consequential elections elsewhere this year and next.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m a Republican, I want this guy to win,\u201d said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University. \u201cBecause I want to be able to compare and contrast my campaign as a Republican, in a national election, to the idea of, \u2018This is where the Democratic party is.\u2019\u201d",
      "New York City's ranked choice voting model allows voters to list up to five candidates on their ballots in order of preference. If a single candidate is the first choice of more than 50% of voters, then that person wins the race outright. Since no candidate cleared that bar on the night of the primary, the ranked choice voting process kicked in. The board is scheduled to certify the election on July 15.",
      "Mamdani has been a member of the state Assembly since 2021, and has characterized his inexperience as a potential asset. His campaign promised free city buses, free child care, a rent freeze for people living in rent-stabilized apartment, government-run grocery stores and more, all paid for with taxes on the wealthy. Critics have slammed his agenda as politically unrealistic.",
      "Cuomo ran a campaign centered on his extensive experience, casting himself as the only candidate capable of saving a city he said had spun out of control. During the campaign, he focused heavily on combating antisemitism and leaned on his name recognition and juggernaut fundraising operation rather than mingling with voters.",
      "Confronted with the sexual harassment allegations that ended his tenure as governor, he denied wrongdoing, maintaining that the scandal was driven by politics and that voters were ready to move on.",
      "Cuomo did not remove his name from the November ballot last week, ahead of a procedural deadline to do so, and has said he is still considering whether to mount an actual campaign for the office.",
      "Adams, while still a Democrat, is running in the November election as an independent. He dropped out of the Democratic primary in April after he was severely wounded by his now-dismissed federal bribery case. Though he had done little in the way of campaigning since then, he reignited his reelection operation in the days after Mamdani declared victory, calling it a choice between a candidate with a \u201cblue collar\u201d and one with a \u201csilver spoon.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is making a day trip to Florida\u2019s Everglades on Tuesday for a firsthand look at a new immigration detention facility that the White House suggests will be especially secure given that it is \u201csurrounded by alligators.\u201d",
      "The detention facility is on an isolated airstrip about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Miami and could house 5,000 detainees. It's drawn protests over the potential impact on a delicate ecosystem and criticism that Trump is trying to send a cruel message to immigrants \u2014 while some Native American leaders have also opposed construction, saying the land is sacred.",
      "But a key selling point for the Trump administration is the site's remoteness, and the fact that it is in swampland filled with mosquitoes, pythons and alligators. The White House hopes that conveys a message to the detainees being housed there and the world at large that repercussions will be severe if the immigration laws of the United States are not followed.",
      "Press secretary Karoline Leavitt noted that the center is \u201cinformally known as Alligator Alcatraz,\u201d a moniker that has alarmed immigrant activists but appeals to the president\u2019s aggressive approach to deportations.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s only one road leading in, and the only way out is a one-way flight,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cIt is isolated and it is surrounded by dangerous wildlife and unforgiving terrain.\u201d",
      "Crackdowns on the border and harsh immigration policies have long been a centerpiece of Trump\u2019s political brand.",
      "During his first term in 2019, Trump denied reports that he floated the idea of building a moat filled with alligators at the U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cI may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough,\" he said at the time.",
      "In his second term, Trump has suggested that his administration could move to reopen Alcatraz, the notorious and hard-to-reach island prison off San Francisco. And Leavitt said the new Florida detention center's inhospitable location \u2014 and dangerous nearby fauna \u2014 were pluses.",
      "\u201cA detention center surrounded by alligators, yes, I do think that\u2019s a deterrent for them to try to escape,\u201d she said.",
      "Former U.S. Rep. David Jolly of Florida, a former Republican who is now running for governor as a Democrat, called the facility a \u201ccallous political stunt.\u201d",
      "The White House has similarly promoted the political shock value of sending some immigrants awaiting deportation from the U.S. to a detention lockup in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and others to a megaprison in El Salvador.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees are in detention facilities for immigration reasons, like entering the country illegally or overstaying a visa. They are either waiting for ICE to put them on the next flight or bus ride home or are fighting their removal in immigration court.",
      "If an immigrant is accused of or has committed a violent crime, he or she is tried and held in state or federal criminal jurisdiction, separate from the immigration system. In those cases, they may be transferred to ICE for deportation after completing their criminal sentences.",
      "State officials are spearheading construction of the Florida facility, but much of the cost is being covered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is best known for responding to hurricanes and other natural disasters.",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, whom Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has credited as the architect of the Everglades plan, first debuted the proposal with a slickly produced video, complete with custom graphics featuring red-eyed alligators and backed by a hard rock soundtrack.",
      "The Florida Republican Party has fundraised off the facility, selling branded T-shirts and beverage container sleeves. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suggested Monday that the facility could be open and \u201cready for business\u201d by the time Trump arrives.",
      "DeSantis said the site has obtained approval from the Department of Homeland Security, which posted an image of alligators wearing ICE hats and sitting in front of a fenced-in compound ringed with barbed wire.",
      "The governor, who challenged Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, has also played up the fact that the site will be hard to escape from.",
      "\u201cThey ain\u2019t going anywhere once they\u2019re there, unless you want them to go somewhere, because good luck getting to civilization,\" DeSantis said. \"So the security is amazing.\u201d",

      "Authorities announced Monday that he had arrived at the jail in the small southern Colorado city of Alamosa, not far from where Suzanne Morphew's skeletal remains were found off a dirt road in September 2023.",
      "Her remains were discovered accidentally as authorities were searching for another missing woman a year after prosecutors dropped their initial prosecution of Morphew.",
      "A 2024 autopsy report said Suzanne Morphew died of \u201cunspecified means\u201d but ruled her death a homicide.

      "A rare Przewalski\u2019s horse foal named Marat is thriving at the Minnesota Zoo, thanks to an unusual surrogate",
      "APPLE VALLEY, Minn. -- An endangered wild Asian horse foal is thriving thanks to an unlikely hero.",
      "Marat, a Przewalski\u2019s horse, fell critically ill soon after his birth at the Minnesota Zoo nearly two months ago. He survived thanks to intensive care. But his mother rejected him when he returned.",
      "His future looked grim until Alice, a domestic Pony of the Americas who\u2019d recently lost her newborn, accepted him as her own. Veterinarians say this is one of the first times this kind of surrogacy has been tried with Asian wild horses, and his caregivers couldn't be happier.",
      "Zoo staffers picked the name Marat because it means \u201cone who is brave,\u201d and he's had to be brave from such a young age",
      "Przewalski's are considered the only remaining truly wild horse species. They were declared extinct in the wild in the 1960s, with just a few surviving in zoos. But they've since been reestablished on the steppes of Mongolia and China, with some in Russia and Ukraine. Since fewer than 2,000 exist today, each foal is critical to the species' survival.",
      "\u201cBeing one of the true wild horses left in the world, behaviorally, they are a little bit different,\" said Kurt Heizmann, the zoo's director of animal care. They've never been truly domesticated, and they're shorter and stockier than familiar breeds, he said.",
      "Marat was born with some limb problems that made it hard for him to stand up straight, said Dr. Annie Rivas, the zoo's director of animal health.",
      "\u201cAnd because he was struggling to keep up with Mom in the herd, he was spending a lot of time lying down on the ground and unfortunately developed bacterial sepsis. So he was very, very sick,\u201d Rivas said.",
      "The University of Minnesota's equine intensive care unit nursed him back from his pneumonia and wounds. But it wasn't unusual that his first-time mom, Nady, would refuse to take him back.",
      "\u201cThat left us with, \u2018What are we going to do with this foal?\u2019\u201d Rivas said. \u201cWe could hand-rear him, but we\u2019re not going to be the ones who are the best at teaching them how to be a horse \u2014 especially a wild horse.\u201d",
      "Fortunately, they found Alice, a gentle mare who was still grieving her own foal but immediately started nurturing Marat and allowing him to nurse.",
      "\u201cIt was really kind of a perfect fairy-tale ending. ... They just bonded like that,\u201d Rivas said.",
      "Integrating Marat into the complex social hierarchies of a wild herd will be the next challenge, she said, but Alice is helping Marat learn how to behave with other horses. They'll probably stay together for a few more months. They want him to join the zoo's adult Przewalski\u2019s herd before he's too old.",
      "\u201cHe is definitely a wild horse,\" Rivas said. \"One, he is a stallion, so he\u2019s already got a big personality from that. But he is also a little more wild than you would expect a domestic horse foal to be at this point in his life.

    "summary": "With no verdict reached in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal sex trafficking trial on the first day of deliberations\u200b, jurors gathered again Tuesday to continue their work.",
    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial wanted to review some of the testimony from the hip-hop mogul's former longtime girlfriend Cassie Ventura during the second day of deliberations Tuesday.",
      "The panel of eight men and four women continued deliberating the charges against Combs after not reaching a verdict on the first day of deliberations.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian began the day by addressing with the prosecution and defense a question posed Monday from the jury about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 which relates to the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The jury sent a note asking for clarification on the part of the instructions addressing drug distribution.",
      "Subramanian said he would remind jurors of the instructions he gave them on that part of the case before they started deliberating on Monday. Combs' lawyers had pushed for a more expansive response, but prosecutors argued \u2014 and Subramanian agreed \u2014 that doing so could end up confusing jurors more.",
      "An exchange between Subramanian and Combs' defense team got a little testy as they wrangled over the response.",
      "\"Can you do what I'm asking or no?\" the judge asked.",
      "\"Of course I can do what your honor is asking,\" one of the defense lawyers responded.",
      "About 75 minutes into Tuesday's deliberations, the jury requested the testimony from Ventura, one of the prosecution's most important witnesses, when she gave her account of Combs allegedly beating, kicking and dragging her at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 \u2014 an assault captured on now-infamous security camera footage. Combs apologized after the video surfaced.",
      "The jury also asked to see Ventura's testimony about an incident in which she said Combs accused her of taking drugs from him and kicked her off of their yacht at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2013. On their way back to the U.S., she said, he threatened to release explicit videos of her having sex.",
      "In addition, the jury asked for Ventura and stripper Daniel Phillip's testimony about her jumping into his lap at a New York City hotel after, as Phillip testified, he suspected Combs had been slapping and slamming her around an adjacent room.",
      "\"Her whole entire body was shaking, like she was terrified,\" said Phillip, who was at the hotel for a sexual encounter with Ventura sometime between 2012 and 2014.",
      "Phillip testified that he asked Ventura why she was with Combs if he was hitting her and beating her. He said he told her she was in real danger. Ventura, he said, \"basically tried to convince me that it was OK, it's OK. I'm fine, I'll be OK.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to\u00a0federal charges\u00a0of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking, and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "The first day of deliberations saw several notes from the jury, as well as Combs and his supporters bowing their heads in prayer in the courtroom. One of the notes came not long after jurors started deliberating and raised concerns from several jurors about another member of the panel. They told the judge they thought \"he cannot follow your honor's instructions.\"",
      "After a discussion between the judge, attorneys for Combs and prosecutors, the judge reminded the jurors of their obligation to follow the law and sent them back to resume their deliberations, but said if more issues should arise, the foreperson should send another note.",
      "To help them come to a verdict, jurors were provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",
      "Five alternate jurors\u00a0are also on standby in case they're needed to fill in on the main jury.",
      "The jury will sift through seven weeks of at times\u00a0graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\" Defense lawyers argued that there was no conspiracy and that his conduct did not violate federal laws.",

    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking case in New York shared concerns about an individual juror with the judge not long after they started deliberating Monday. The first day of deliberations ultimately ended without a verdict.",
      "After more than two hours of legal instructions from federal Judge Arun Subramanian, the jury of eight men and four women headed behind closed doors to deliberate at around 11:30 a.m. Subramanian told the five alternate jurors to remain on standby in case they're needed to fill in on the main jury who are weighing charges that could put the hip-hop mogul in prison for life.",
      "About 10 minutes into deliberations, the jury sent a note indicating they'd completed their first order of business: electing a foreperson.",
      "Less than two hours later, at about 1:25 p.m., a note from the jury was read in court  to inform the judge of concerns regarding one juror's ability to follow the instructions. The jury asked the judge to question this juror. The judge discussed the response with the prosecution and defense and decided to remind the jury of their obligation to follow the law and resume their deliberations.",
      "After the judge originally proposed asking the jury foreperson the nature of concerns about the fellow juror, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo suggested caution and that less be said rather than more.",
      "\"We can always ratchet it up. We can't ratchet it down,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the late afternoon, the jury sent the judge a new note with a question about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 stemming from the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The judge told the court he'd answer them on Tuesday and dismissed the jury for the day.",
      "Jurors are being provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",
      "Subramanian had stressed to the jury the importance of delivering a unanimous verdict, but also said no juror should surrender their beliefs in order to reach unanimity.",
      "Ahead of the deliberations, CBS News legal contributor Caroline Polisi, a criminal defense attorney, discussed on \"CBS Mornings\" what judges typically tell juries.",
      "\"The judge will instruct the jurors, 'maintain your own integrity with respect to what you believe, but keep an open mind, engage in discussions with other jurors, look at the evidence, see other people's point of view, and if you can with integrity really come over to, you know, the other side, then you can get to unanimity,'\" Polisi said.",
      "As the deliberations got underway, Combs faced his family and supporters in the courtroom gallery. They bowed their heads in prayer \u2014 his family members holding hands with each other. When they finished, they all applauded.",
      "The judge granted Combs' request to have some books with him during the deliberations. On his way out of the courtroom on Monday, Combs showed two books to reporters: \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" and \"The Happiness Advantage.\"",
      "The jury will sift through seven weeks of sometimes graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking \u2014 relating to two of his ex-girlfriends \u2014 and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "Polisi said the prosecution's best chance at getting a conviction could be with the sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"The prosecution made clear there only has to be one instance, out of these hundreds of 'freak-offs,' one instance where it was coerced by force, fraud or coercion, and that can include threats of harm that doesn't even include physical harm,\" Polisi said. \"So that can include fear of financial harm, fear of reputational harm. Remember, he videotaped all of these encounters, and the government laid out specific instances where he threatened to release those tapes.\"",
      "In closing arguments last week, federal prosecutors and Combs' defense team took their last shots at convincing jurors to convict or acquit the Grammy Award-winning founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law.\"",
      "She said that he used his \"close inner circle and a small army of personal staff, who made it their mission to meet the defendant's every desire, promote his power and protect his reputation at all costs.\"",
      "Agnifilo countered, \"This isn't about crime. It's about money.\" He noted that one of Combs' accusers in the criminal case also sued him in civil court.",
      "\"He is not a racketeer. He is not a conspirator to commit racketeering. He is none of these things. He is innocent. He sits there innocent. Return him to his family, who have been waiting for him,\" the lawyer told jurors.",
      "In all, 34 witnesses testified, headlined by Combs' former girlfriends Cassie \u2014 the R&B singer born Casandra Ventura \u2014 and \"Jane,\" who testified under a pseudonym. Both women said he often was violent toward them. Cassie said he forced her into hundreds of sexual encounters with paid male sex workers while Jane recounted numerous \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Jurors also saw now-infamous security camera video of Combs beating, kicking and dragging Cassie at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 and clips from videos of sexual encounters.",
      "Combs chose not to testify, and his lawyers didn't call any witnesses in their defense case. His attorneys elected instead to challenge the accusers' credibility during lengthy cross-examination questioning.",
      "The defense has acknowledged that Combs veered into violence, but his lawyers maintain that the sex acts were consensual. They contend that prosecutors are intruding in Combs' personal life and that he's done nothing to warrant the charges against him.",

      "The taxpayer-funded BBC said in a statement Monday that it regrets not cutting short its live streaming signal after punk-rap duo Bob Vylan started leading a chant of \"Death, death to the IDF,\" during their Saturday performance, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "\"The BBC respects freedom of expression but stands firmly against incitement to violence,\" the statement\u00a0from the broadcaster said. \"The antisemitic sentiments expressed by Bob Vylan were utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves... The [BBC broadcasting] team were dealing with a live situation but with hindsight we should have pulled the stream during the performance. We regret this did not happen.\"",
      "The BBC, which is CBS News' partner network in the U.K., quickly acknowledged that the language used on Saturday was \"deeply offensive,\" but the network was criticized \u2014 including by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and members of his cabinet \u2014\u2014 for not reacting more quickly after the chant started.",
      "Glastonbury festival's organizers also condemned the chant in a statement, saying: \"Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\"",
      "The reaction from the Trump administration appeared to be significantly harsher, with Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau saying in a social media post on Monday that U.S. entry visas already issued to Bob Vylan's members had been revoked \"in light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants.\"",
      "The band's website shows more than a dozen scheduled tour dates in the U.S., from coast to coast, starting in late October.",

    "story": [
      "He was born on the planet Krypton. But the Man of Steel comes to life in California, inside an edit room in Burbank. It's there that James Gunn is reviewing a scene from what Warner Brothers hopes is a summer blockbuster: \"Superman.\" With a reported budget of at least $225 million, it arrives in theaters July 11.",
      "It's the first feature from DC Studios, a division of Warner Brothers.\u00a0 Gunn is not only the film's director; he wrote the screenplay, and he's DC's CEO.",
      "\"I feel good about the movie,\" he said. \"And I'm excited about that. And I think we've done something that's different.\"",
      "Among those differences: \"My Superman is not indestructible,\" Gunn said. \"We see him bleed, immediately. At times, I've thought, 'He's too strong.' You don't want him to be able to punch a planet in half or, for that matter, go around a planet a billion times and make time go backwards, you know? I wanted a Superman who was a little bit more down-to-Earth.\"",
      "And few things are more down-to-Earth than a dog. \"The dog is the whole reason \u2013 [it] was the start of the movie for me, a thousand percent,\" Gunn said. \"I adopted a dog. His name is Ozu. And he didn't want to be touched, he had never known human beings. He chewed up all our furniture. He was, you know, chasing the cat, and just being the worst dog you can imagine. And I thought, 'Wow. What if this terrible dog had super powers? I'd really be screwed!'\"",
      "The first Superman feature film came in 1951 with George Reeves, who later played the role on TV. In this century, Superman has been played by Brandon Routh and Henry Cavill. But in the last 75 years, only one big screen Superman has fully captured the audience's imagination: Christopher Reeve.",
      "Trained in the theater, Reeve was a graduate of the Juilliard School in New York \u2013 as is the new Superman, David Corenswet. He is 31 \u2013 seven years older than Reeve was when he made his debut in 1978. \"I don't think there's any way or reason to try to sort of live up to Christopher Reeve,\" Corenswet said. \"I just feel grateful to get to play that character that he embodied and put into the public consciousness in such a positive and strong way.\"",
      "We met Corenswet at the Arden Theatre in Philadelphia. It's Corenswet's hometown, where he still lives, and it's at the Arden where he landed his first paid gig, when he was nine years old: \"All My Sons\" by Arthur Miller.",
      "Like his Superman, Corenswet is immediately disarming, as well as vulnerable, as in a scene with Superman's girlfriend, reporter Lois Lane (played by Rachel Brosnahan).",
      "\"He is definitively different from everybody else on Earth,\" Corenswet said. \"He is not human. He's an alien, and he has these powers that nobody else has. And at the same time, he wants desperately to be a part of humanity. So ultimately, the dramatic stakes of Superman as a character is that he is lonely and he doesn't want to be.\"",
      "He also has a sense of humor about those red shorts. \"Without the trunks, the uniform can look very military,\" Corenswet said. \"So he puts the red underwear on, a) so that everybody can see him, against the blue sky you can see the red trunks, b) so that everybody knows he doesn't take himself too seriously. He's not trying to look cool.",
      "\"Now, that doesn't in any way undermine how badass and cool he is when he's up in the sky fighting the bad guys. But once he touches down, he wants to be the one that people can laugh or make fun of, because he can take it.\"",
      "Superman has been saving the world for nearly nine decades. Created by Jerry Siegel and drawn by Joe Shuster, he first appeared in a comic in 1938.",
      "Asked if Superman represents the signature American movie character, critic and filmmaker Elvis Mitchell said, \"I think he's bigger than that. Spider-Man is tortured. You know, he has to support himself and his aunt, and he's responsible for the death of his uncle. And Batman's responsible for the death of everybody in his line of sight. They're all sufferers.",
      "\"But Superman, he stands tall, and there's a pride of authorship, literally, in the character. 'Cause he's creating his own narrative as his alter ego. People want to see that. They want to believe that you can create your own narrative in a way that is benevolent, even if you have all the power in the world. It's wrong of you to turn away from people who need your help.\"",
      "Asked what he wants audiences around the world to take away from his Superman, Gunn said, \"I think, just culturally, being able to place a little bit more importance on being a good human being. I think we're surrounded by a lot of meanness. I think Superman is surrounded by a lot of meanness in the movie. But he stands against that grain. And that's what makes him rebellious.",
      "\"And in a way, I think today, in today's world, Superman's the edgier, more rebellious character because he's the one who's standing up for the values that most people are not,\" he said.",
      "Corenswet is embracing the challenge, fully aware that success could mean Superman defines his career. He said, \"When you take a role that's gonna be this visible and this iconic, even just visually iconic, and it's your face and the underwear, yeah, I wanted to be prepared for the possibility that it wouldn't lead to a bunch of other things, that this would be the thing.",
      "\"And I felt really lucky that when I asked myself that question the answer came back, somebody's gotta play this part, and if you're the person to play it and you give up everything else to do it, it would be worth doing.\"",

      "Separately, \"Rust\" armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March 2024.

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs\u00a0was portrayed in his lawyer's closing argument on Friday as the victim of an overzealous prosecution that tried to turn the recreational use of drugs and a swinger lifestyle into a racketeering conspiracy that could put the music mogul behind bars for life.",
      "Attorney Marc Agnifilo mocked the government's case against Combs and belittled the agents who seized hundreds of bottles of Astroglide lubricant and baby oil at his properties as he began his four-hour presentation Friday in a New York courtroom.",
      "\"Way to go, fellas,\" he said of the agents.",
      "He said prosecutors had \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes to combine it with recreational drug use and call it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Agnifilo said of Combs: \"He sits there innocent. Return him to his family who have been waiting for him.\"",
      "Agnifilo called Combs' prosecution a \"fake trial\" and ridiculed the notion that he engaged in racketeering. \"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?\" Agnifilo asked. \"Did any witness get on that witness stand and say yes, I was part of a racketeering enterprise \u2014 I engaged in racketeering?\" No, Agnifilo argued, telling jurors that those accusations were a figment of the prosecution's imagination.",
      "The lawyer argued prosecutors had invaded Combs' most intimate personal affairs, telling jurors: \"Where's the crime scene? It's your sex life.\"",
      "Agnifilo also argued there's another factor at play in the allegations that women have lobbed against Combs: the prospect of draining him of his wealth through lawsuits.",
      "\"This isn't about crime. It's about money. This is about money,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the prosecution's rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said Agnifilo had spent \"a whole lot of energy\" trying to distract from Combs' \"inexcusable behavior.\"",
      "\"Make no mistake,\" Comey told jurors, \"this trial was about how in Sean Combs' world, 'no' was never an option.\"",
      "In his closing argument, Agnifilo reiterated that the defense \"owns\" the fact that Combs was violent but argued that behavior does not justify the grave charges against him.",
      "Combs and R&B singer\u00a0Cassie Ventura Fine\u00a0had a \"loving, beautiful relationship,\" albeit a \"complicated\" one, Agnifilo said. \"If racketeering conspiracy had an opposite, it would be their relationship,\" Agnifilo said. \"They were deeply in love with each other.\"",
      "In her rebuttal, Comey said, \"Being a domestic abuser is not a defense to sex trafficking.\"",
      "Jurors are expected to begin deliberating on Monday.",
      "Combs' family, including six of his children and his mother, were in the audience for the defense's closing, which took place a day after the prosecution made its closing arguments Thursday \u2014 after calling on 34 witnesses over the course of seven weeks. Combs' ex-girlfriend, Ventura Fine, and rapper\u00a0Kid Cudi, were among those who testified.",
      "The trial of Combs, 55, began on May 12. Prosecutors allege he relied on employees, resources and influence of his business empire to create a criminal enterprise that engaged in \u2014 or attempted to engage in \u2014 \"sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for the purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.\"",
      "Combs has denied the allegations against him and\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to five counts. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.",
      "Combs has been present at the trial but told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian earlier this week that he decided not to testify.",
      "\"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I'm making it,\" he said.",
      "The defense\u00a0rested\u00a0on Tuesday after presenting its case for less than 30 minutes. It didn't call any witnesses.",
      "Combs' lawyers built their case for acquittal through lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Some testified only in response to subpoenas and insisted they didn't want to be there.",
      "In federal prosecutors' closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said to the jury that Combs used \"power, violence and fear\" to rule a criminal enterprise, which allegedly facilitated brutal sex crimes. Slavik said Combs \"counted on silence and shame\" to allow his abuse to continue. She also said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up.",

      "Schifrin's son, Ryan Schifrin, confirmed the death to CBS News in a statement, saying his father \"succumbed to complications from pneumonia.\"",
      "\"His family was at his side, and he passed peacefully,\" Schifrin said. \"We are grateful for the opportunity to be there for him. We are still trying to process this loss, and are very moved by all the love and support we have received.\"",

      "\"Every movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \"The movie dictates what the music will be.\"",

The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",

      "Schifrin's composition of the \"Mission: Impossible\" theme",
      "But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television's \"Mission: Impossible,\" which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \"only the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\" by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song, but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\"The producer called me and told me, 'You're going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it's going to start with a fuse,'\" Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \"So I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that's why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\"",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin's music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin's music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\"I remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\" Giacchino told NPR. \"And I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, 'Just have fun with it.' And I did.\"",
      "\"Mission: Impossible\" won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996's first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand's Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Schifrin's background and his other prolific work",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band.",
      "Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie's quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \"Gillespiana.\"",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965's \"Jazz Suite on the Mass Texts\" while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV's \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \"Tango,\" \"Rush Hour\" and its two sequels, \"Bringing Down The House,\" \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey,\" \"After the Sunset\" and the horror film \"Abominable.\"",
      "Writing the arrangements for \"Dirty Harry,\" Schifrin decided that the main character wasn't in fact Clint Eastwood's hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\"You would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\" he told the AP. \"I wrote a theme for Scorpio.\"",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\"Receiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\" Schifrin said at the time. \"It is mission accomplished.\"",
      "Among Schifrin's conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California's Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \"Christmas in Vienna\" in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \"Letters from Argentina,\" nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event's 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \"Songs of the Aztecs.\" The work premiered at Mexico's Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site's Aztec temple.",
      "\"I found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \"But the real answer is that there's something magic about it. ... There's something magic in the art of music anyway.\"",

      "\"I have had to basically change my whole life, like inside out,\" she said.",
      "While MARINA stepped back from her career, her early music found new life on TikTok.",
      "\"It is strange because I was so used to like pushing to make things happen in my career. And then suddenly this whole thing, you get three platinum records by doing nothing,\" she said.",
      "Now living in Los Angeles, MARINA approaches each album with detailed planning, usually in a journal. But this time, she made an album map for \"Princess of Power\" which includes a color palette, themes and the kind of energy she wanted the music to have: cosmic, love rush, euphoric, dazzling, bright light and powerful.",
      "\"This album was different because I think I'm at the point where I'm not writing so much to like heal myself,\" she said. \"I was like, I have this platform, and I want to make sure that whatever I'm putting out into the world has a certain type of energy that feels positive to me \u2026 because that's what I really needed two years ago when I started writing this.\"",
      "\"You don't get to do this many times in your life, you know, as an artist,\" she continued. \"So, I was like, this is the time I'm gonna do this. Let's see what happens.\"",
      "Performing these new songs allows MARINA to embody the transformation she's undergone.",
      "\"It's almost like making it public means I can suddenly step into it,\" she said. \"It's almost like I can finally say to people, 'This is who I am actually.' Like the person you knew four years ago has gone.\"",
      "That transformation represents more than recovery, it's a reclamation of her power.",

    "story": [
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and '70s with bubblegum pop hits like \"Little Woman\" and \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" has died, his wife said in a statement posted to social media. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \"Bobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light.\"",
      "Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech\u00a0on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 09:20:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Scientists conducting medical research are facing an existential crisis: Layoffs and budget cuts pushed by President Trump that, they say, jeopardize finding a cure for cancer.",
    "story": [
      "They might easily be mistaken for Congressional staffers, reluctant to face the day, but these are among the most accomplished cancer specialists in the country, meeting with Representatives, Senators and staff. Among them: Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, from up the road in Baltimore; and Dr. George Weiner, a cancer specialist in Iowa for more than 35 years, who has flown in frequently to lobby Congress for more research funds.",
      "Lobbying for cancer research, he says, used to be like pushing on an open door. \"Most of the time when I've come, I've met with Democrats and Republicans, and we talked about the bipartisan support for cancer research,\" Weiner said. \"This is the first time that I felt there was an existential crisis in our ability to make the type of progress that I see in front of us.\"",
      "These days, the conversation is all about thousands of layoffs \u2026 delays in research \u2026 massive budget cuts \u2013 close to a 40% proposed cut in funding for the National Cancer Institute.",
      "\"I wake up every morning looking at my phone: Did I get an email from the National Cancer Institute saying I'm no longer receiving my grants?\" said Jaffee.",
      "Has she felt the impact yet? \"Oh, yeah, we certainly have felt the impact, to the point where people are leaving,\" Jaffee replied. \"So, in our clinical research operation, which takes years to build, train research nurses, takes two years to train coordinators, takes six to 12 months, these people are leaving because the funding isn't coming in.\"",
      "I asked, \"If they keep cutting back, how long before Dr. Jaffee says, 'That's it'?\"",
      "\"I have to be honest, there are days when I do feel that,\" she replied. \"But I look around and I feel like I would be disloyal to our patients. We are in a technological revolution in cancer research. We are rapidly making discoveries that we couldn't even do ten years ago.\"",
      "\"What price do you put on life?\"",
      "Kevin Callahan was a Marine in Vietnam when he barely survived stepping on a land mine. Decades later, he was diagnosed with a killer disease: pancreatic cancer. First came surgery and chemo. Now, he's part of a clinical trial, which is where Dr. Jaffee and her colleague Dr. Neeha Zaidi come in, working to develop a vaccine to prevent pancreatic cancer from recurring.",
      "I asked Callahan, \"When you see some of the debates that are going on right now, and it relates to the National Cancer Institute and NIH \u2026\"",
      "\"It raises the hair on the back of my neck,\" he replied.",
      "Beth Callahan wasn't all that sure about the clinical trial at first, but Kevin couldn't stop thinking about all that had gone into it \u2013 getting chemotherapy as an approved treatment. \"They would shoot me up with three drugs, and the fourth one I would go home with a little bag on my chest, and it wouldn't come out until Friday. It had to be done over 40 hours. I thought to myself, 'How many poor bastards went through tests to get that done?' So I thought, 'If there's anything that I can do, I'm more than happy to go in with the study and see if I can help somebody else later on, [to] develop this vaccine.'\"",
      "Pancreatic cancer is particularly nasty, even when, as with Kevin, it's detected early. The experimental vaccine they've been administering to him is promising, but according to Jaffee, the chances of recurrence are 80%, and the chances of a patient being alive in five years is 20%.",
      "Yet, Kevin is four-and-a-half years out, without recurrence, \"part of a small cohort of patients who received the vaccine on that trial who are, like him, doing well without recurrence,\" Jaffee said.",
      "I asked, \"Could it be anything other than the vaccine?",
      "Jaffee replied, \"We don't believe so. This is not a cancer where sometimes it looks less aggressive than other times. This is a cancer that uniformly \u2013 it doesn't matter who you are \u2013 it comes back.\"",
      "And so far, it has not. Kevin says, \"Bottom line, I'm cancer free.\"",
      "Now the Callahans are concerned the cuts at the NIH could interfere with \u2013 or even stop \u2013 Kevin's vaccine trial.",
      "I said, \"They claim that they're not cutting back on any of the science, on any of the people who are really doing the research.\"",
      "\"I don't believe that for a minute,\" said Kevin.",
      "Asked if it is worth the money invested by taxpayers, Beth responded: \"What price do you put on life? It's our lives. It's our children's lives. It's our grandchildren's lives. What price do you put on that? We're not just talking about cutting funding to individual research programs. We're talking about NIH, which is a gift that we have had in this country for decades. Why would we give that up as a country?\"",
      "Located just outside of Washington, D.C., the National Cancer Institute is the crown jewel of the National Institutes of Health. It is also the most expensive. Its budget last year was $7 billion.",
      "Dr. Weiner noted, \"Mary Lasker, who was a brilliant woman and a force of nature who worked with Richard Nixon on the original war on cancer, would say, 'If you think research is expensive, try disease.'\"",
      "The Trump administration is proposing cutting that $7 billion cancer budget down to about $4.5 billion. Weiner thinks that America's widely-recognized position as the world's leader in medical research is at a tipping point. \"Progress is gonna be proportional to investment,\" he said. \"So, progress is not gonna totally stop if funding drops dramatically. But the more it drops and the longer it drops, the slower progress will be.",
      "\"But that's not the case for patients,\" he said. \"Our job as researchers is to bring those advances to help those patients as soon as possible, because those patients can't wait.\"",
      "That would describe Natalie Phelps' dilemma to a T.",
      "\"When is cancer political?",
      "Natalie Phelps has Stage 4 metastatic colorectal cancer. \u00a0She and her husband, Jeff, live out in Washington State.",
      "\"We have one boy, one girl, and a giant German Shepherd, very average American,\" she said. \"And I had always hoped, if I needed a clinical trial, I was like, 'I'm gonna get to the NIH. I'm gonna go to the top place in the world.'\"",
      "Phelps was invited to NIH for testing to determine if she qualified for a promising breakthrough immunotherapy treatment that has shrunk tumors in about a quarter of the patients with gastrointestinal cancers. \u00a0She said, \"When I was invited to go back, I had cancer patients congratulating me. They were like, 'You made it!' It's like making it into the Olympics when you're a cancer patient.\"",
      "The clinical trial is run by Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a legend in the field of cancer research who is still practicing in his mid-eighties. \"Well, she's a young woman with a metastatic cancer, and so that's a desperate situation. Every patient we see here at the National Cancer Institute has been through all standard treatments that haven't worked. And they come here to the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, of Hope, trying to see if some experimental treatments might be of help to them.\"",
      "In late May, Natalie Phelps finally qualified for Rosenberg's clinical trial. But budget cuts at NIH had already slowed the trial down. NIH has lost about 1,500 employees.",
      "\"We did lose two technicians that are involved in producing the materials that are used to treat patients,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "\"And would that cause a significant delay?\" I asked. \"When I say 'significant,' I mean in Natalie's case she feels that it has been delayed by a month. Is that correct?\"",
      "\"That's correct.\"",
      "\"A month could be critical for her.\"",
      "\"It certainly can when you have metastatic cancer that's growing,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "That one-month delay means Natalie's specialized immune cell therapy won't be ready until late July. I said to her, \"I don't even know what seems like an appropriate question. You must be devastated.\"",
      "\"Well, yeah, Ted,\" she replied. \"I was diagnosed in 2020 during COVID, after giving birth to my second child. And I had to spend the first bit of my child's life changing diapers and doing bottles with the chemotherapy pump attached to me. I've done 48 rounds of chemotherapy. I've had multiple aggressive surgeries and radiation. And I have been in treatment for five years, hoping that I can raise her, but at the very least let her have a memory of who her mother was.",
      "\"I have endured so much, and now I have another hurdle just because of funding cuts?\" she said. \"I mean, my husband and I can't believe it. When is cancer political?\"",
      "In a recent online statement, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya pushed back on concerns about budget cuts and employee layoffs. He said, \"As to the current re-organization, no clinical trial has been delayed, nor has any participant been dropped from any clinical trial\u2026\"",
      "Natalie Phelps is just one patient, one case out of many; but her participation in a clinical trial was delayed, because two specialized technicians were let go.",
      "And that delay has proved to be devastating. She sent us a video message a couple of days ago from NIH:",
      "\"I got my test results back today and I didn't pass,\" she said. \"I have several new brain tumors, and it's not safe for me to participate in the trial. The earliest I could get back here for treatment would be about six weeks after having the tumors radiated, provided that the radiation's successful. I don't know. It's a long time.\"",
      "As for the budget cuts that caused the layoffs that produced the delay, it probably won't help much to learn that they were nothing personal.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-us-funding-gavi-vaccine-alliance-travesty-experts-warn/",
    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 13:32:21 -0400",
    "summary": "RFK Jr. announced a halt to all U.S. funding for the global Gavi vaccine alliance. One expert calls it a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Every four years, representatives to the global alliance of governments, pharmaceutical makers, United Nations agencies and philanthropic organizations known as Gavi, which helps get vaccines to people who need them, meet to lock in new funding pledges. Just as this year's meeting in Brussels was drawing to a close on Wednesday, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that all funding from Washington would cease.",
      "In a three-and-a-half-minute video message that Kennedy\u00a0shared on social media, he said the Trump administration was halting funding to the organization because it had \"neglected the key issue of vaccine safety.\"",
      "Kennedy, who has sought to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, has a history of making\u00a0misleading statements about\u00a0vaccine safety and has been tied to\u00a0anti-vaccine activism groups.",
      "Gavi says it has helped vaccinate more than 1.1 billion children in 78 low income countries and prevented more than 18.8 million deaths since its creation 25 years ago. Its focus is getting vaccines, especially new vaccines, to populations that would struggle to afford them or access them otherwise.",
      "Kennedy argued in the video that GAVI \"has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,\" and that \"when vaccine safety issues have come before Gavi, Gavi has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.\"",
      "Kennedy accused GAVI of ignoring the science and said the alliance must \"justify the $8 billion the U.S. has given it since 2001.\"",
      "The U.S. has long been among the top government contributors to Gavi's funding, which also comes from private organizations.",
      "The Biden administration had committed to $1.6 billion in funding for the organization from 2026 through 2030 \u2014 an amount roughly equal to the funding pledged by the private Gates Foundation \u2014 and shock and outrage reverberated across the conference in Brussels after Kennedy's announcement.",
      "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and the Gates Foundation, said on social media that the move would have \"devastating consequences.\" He called on the U.S. Congress to keep funding Gavi, warning that if it did not, \"more sick kids will fall behind in school,\" and there would be \"more overcrowded hospital wards and eventually more grieving parents.\"",
      "\"If Congress allows this to happen, the consequences will be devastating,\" Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said. \"Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of preventable deaths will occur, especially among mothers and children.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, a public health researcher and surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who previously held a seat on the Gavi board, said Kennedy would be held personally responsible for the results of halted U.S. government funding, which he called a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
      "\"I would expect to see significant changes and reductions in access to safe and effective vaccines to children, in the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world,\" one U.S. official with decades of experience in global health and vaccination programs told CBS News on the condition of anonymity. \"Kennedy's rhetoric on vaccine safety is not helpful and is likely to fuel vaccine hesitancy in the minds of people across the world, where we will surely now see more uncontrolled outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This is very unfortunate.\"",
      "The U.N.'s World Health Organization has warned since 2019 that vaccine hesitancy and mistrust is one of the leading threats to global public health.",
      "The goal of this year's conference was to secure funding to reach the organization's target of over 90% global coverage with essential vaccines for a wide range of diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and measles. Gavi received more than $9 billion in funding commitments on Wednesday, but it had hoped to garner $11.9 billion for the next five years, with the goal of immunizing 500 million children globally.",
      "Other countries acknowledged Gavi's importance, and increased their contributions at the conference on Wednesday.",
      "Topping that list was the U.K.",
      "British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced $1.7 billion for the coming five years, making the U.K. Gavi's new largest donor.",
      "Ghana's President John Darami Mahama, addressing the Gavi conference on Wednesday, began by detailing his younger brother's struggle with polio, and the stigma associated with the disease, which has been virtually eradicated worldwide thanks to vaccination programs launched in the late 1980s.",
      "\"I understand the importance of vaccines,\" Mahama told the delegations.",
      "When his brother was diagnosed, vaccine access in Ghana was close to zero, but the president said that, through partnership with Gavi, 97% of the population was now vaccinated.",
      "He said officials were still working to reach the last 3% \u2014   about \"65,000 children who are in remote areas, difficult to reach for life saving vaccines\" \u2014 and that Ghana planned to no longer need Gavi's support by 2030.",
      "Mahama concluded his remarks with a topical comparison, saying: \"One B-2 Spirit Bomber that dropped bombs on Iran cost $2.13 billion,\" and that he had done the math, adding: \"Surely the world can afford the value of four B-2 bombers to save 500 million children. It's a choice we have to make.\"",

      "She is joining the CDC office responsible for overseeing most of the agency's work and data to probe potential safety risks from vaccines, including databases used by health officials to collect and analyze reports from the public and health care systems.",
      "Redwood is expected to be hired as a special government employee, the CDC officials said, a status often afforded to advisers and other temporary experts brought on for specific projects or committees.",
      "The CDC and Redwood did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Redwood is also scheduled to present Thursday to the agency's new roster of outside vaccine advisers, who were replaced earlier this month by Kennedy with his own picks, about her concerns about the vaccine preservative thimerosal causing autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "The CDC and outside groups have debunked fears about thimerosal causing autism in the past. In a report briefly published on the CDC's website before this week's vaccines meeting, the agency cited several studies turning up no evidence of thimerosal causing neurodevelopmental disorders, and warned of significant methodological issues with a handful of studies that did.",
      "\"Considering the breadth of evidence and consistency in results from multiple population-based studies conducted in several countries with various study designs, the evidence does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders,\" the CDC said in its now-deleted report.",
      "Children's Health Defense in the past has criticized the CDC Immunization Safety Office for its efforts to debunk concerns about thimerosal, accusing the office in 2018 of attempting \"to pull the wool over the public's eyes\" about the preservative. Kennedy echoed some of those claims in a post late Tuesday on X.",
      "\"Removing a known neurotoxin from being injected into our most vulnerable populations is a good place to start with Making America Healthy Again,\" Redwood said in prepared slides released by the agency ahead of the Thursday meeting.",
      "Redwood's addition to the agenda sparked a renewed round of criticism for Kennedy, who medical groups worry is dismantling a key component of how the U.S. develops influential vaccine recommendations tied to insurance coverage and federal policies.",
      "\"Even though the prevalence of thimerosal in flu vaccines is low and it hasn't been linked to developmental issues, the public confusion and over ethylmercury remains \u2014 confusion that anti-vaccine activists, such as Lyn Redwood, have sought to stoke,\" the University of Minnesota's Vaccine Integrity Project wrote Monday.",
      "Beyond thimerosal, which the CDC says data suggests is used in less than 0.3% of flu vaccines given to moms during pregnancy, Redwood has raised concerns about other vaccine ingredients.",
      "In an interview with Kennedy published in October last year, Redwood said aluminum had been found in the brains of children with autism at \"some of the highest levels ever documented.\"",
      "The FDA has said aluminum added to some vaccines has \"a demonstrated safety profile of over many decades of use,\" and that aluminum exposure is most commonly from eating food or drinking water.",
      "Redwood said she had worked with one of the heads of the CDC's Immunization Safety Office in the past over her concerns about mercury in vaccines.",
      "\"I was so naive. I really thought that they would take immediate action, and that they would stop these exposures,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "When it comes to finding a job, where you look can be just as important as who you know.",
      "A new analysis by SmartAsset sought to identify the best job markets around the U.S. by ranking 348 cities based on six metrics: unemployment rate; rate of income growth; percentage of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance; typical commute time; percentage of remote workers; and median housing payments as a share of income.",
      "Read on to find which cities have the most to offer U.S. workers.",
      "Which cities have the best overall job market?",
      "Bend, Oregon, has the top job market in the United States, according to SmartAsset. The West Coast city notched points for its low unemployment rate (3.1%) and high income growth. From 2020 to 2023, the median income in Bend grew 44% \u2014 the fourth highest rate after Richmond, Virginia, (50%); Nampa, Idaho, (47%); and Dayton, Ohio, (45%).",
      "A hub for outdoor recreation, Bend also stands out for its work-life balance. The median commute time for workers in Bend is 16 minutes, with just over a quarter of the city's population working remotely.",
      "Trailing Bend in the No. 2 and No. 3 spots for best overall job markets are Richmond, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington.",
      "Which cities have the highest percentage of health care coverage for workers?",
      "For workers looking for solid health care coverage, a move to Santa Clara, California, may be worth considering. Over 88% of the population in the southern Bay Area city have private health insurance plans through their employer. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Bellevue, Washington, follow close behind with roughly 87% of their residents having health coverage through their employers.",
      "Which cities have the shortest commutes?",
      "Spending large chunks of time sitting on a train or stuck in traffic is not conducive to good work-life balance. For that reason, cities with the shortest commute times contribute to top job market rankings in SmartAssets' study.",
      "With a median commute time of roughly 14 minutes, workers in Wichita Falls, Texas, have one the shortest commute times in the country, according SmartAsset. Abilene, Texas, and Topeka, Kansas, workers also spend less time in transit than others, with median commutes of around 14 and 15 minutes, respectively.",
      "Which cities are remote-work friendly?",
      "When it comes to cities with the highest percentage of remote workers, Frisco, Texas, part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro, stands out from the crowd, with over 32% of workers conducting their jobs remotely. Berkeley, California, and Charlotte, North Carolina, also embrace work from home with a total 29% and 28% remote workers, respectively.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 13:53:32 -0400",
    "summary": "GOP tax and spending bill would create a tax deduction for workers in tipped occupations. But not all would lower taxes for workers in tipped jobs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's promise to eliminate federal income tax on worker tips could soon come to fruition after the Senate passed President Trump's massive budget package.",
      "One part of the legislation, the centerpiece of the Trump administration's economic agenda, would provide workers who rely on tips for a large share of their income, such as waiters, bartenders and hairdressers, with relief from federal income tax on those tips.",
      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",
      "Senators narrowly approved the legislation, which Republicans call the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" on July 1 by a vote of 51-50. The measure now returns to the House for sign off. Mr. Trump has vowed to swiftly sign the bill and urged lawmakers to approve it by July 4.",
      "How would \"no tax on tips\" work?",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate versions\u00a0of the tax and spending bill vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who would benefit?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all would benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants would qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees would not despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-trump-tariffs/",
    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 10:11:37 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists warned that a barrage of new U.S. tariffs could trigger a renewed bout of inflation. So why aren't prices surging?",
    "story": [
      "Despite concerns earlier this year that President Trump's tariffs would cause a renewed bout of inflation, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have remained relatively stable.",
      "The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.3% in May, modestly above the central bank's 2% annual target. The May Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.4%, cooler than economists expected.",
      "The muted inflation data reflects short-term steps taken by some companies to offset the tariff impact, such as pre-ordering inventory, absorbing the cost of some tariffs to cushion consumers from price hikes, and leveraging loopholes to delay or lower duty payments, economists say.",
      "Additionally, cost increases for parts and other intermediate inputs could take time to work their way through supply chains before they show up in consumer prices.",
      "\"Many businesses have been creative and savvy in using different means to buffer the initial shock,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That doesn't mean consumers and businesses, who were battered by the highest inflation in decades during the pandemic, are out of the woods. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, thinks prices are likely to rise as tariffs gradually push up import costs in the second half of the year.",
      "\"We still think in next few months we'll continue to see the impact of the new trade policies on price levels, and they should translate into higher inflation,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Here are three reasons why tariffs haven't driven up inflation as much as many economists expected, at least for now.",
      "Aggressive \"front-loading\"",
      "After the Trump administration announced a range of tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico and dozens of other countries earlier this year, many companies scrambled to stock up, or front-load, on products, parts and other imports to\u00a0avoid incurring added tariff costs.",
      "\"They tried to front-run the imposition of the duties by importing rapidly,\" Daco said. \"They bought goods they needed and stocked them, so that was the first line of defense against the tariffs.\"",
      "Much of that extra inventory remains in warehouses or on store shelves, allowing importers to delay price hikes.",
      "\"Lots of retailers pre-ordered inventory before the tariffs went into effect, so the inventory they're selling has not been marked up yet,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waiting for clarity",
      "Some businesses facing higher tariffs are choosing to hold off on passing any cost increases through to consumers\u00a0as they wait for the fog around U.S. trade policy to lift.",
      "The Trump administration in April froze most of its tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, with that pause due to expire on July 9. And after announcing tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports earlier this year, Mr. Trump and Chinese officials on Thursday said the two countries have agreed on the framework for a trade deal.",
      "\"We have had literally dozens of changes in tariff policy in the last five months. In that highly uncertain environment, companies that sell items that are subject to tariff may be cautious about raising prices immediately,\" Charley Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Companies often refrain from raising prices to avoid scaring away consumers and losing market share to competitors.",
      "Added Daco: \"Essentially, some business decided to not immediately pass on the cost. They said, 'Let's see if we can hold out for a month, delay some imports, use the inventory on hand and be creative in terms of our broader pricing strategy'.\"",
      "Although tariffs are paid by importers, which typically pass those costs on to consumers, some foreign exporters have also been willing to take a hit.",
      "Lower tariff costs",
      "Although Mr. Trump has announced sky-high tariff rates, the actual duties collected at the U.S. border so far are lower than the official rates. That's because some importers have been able to skirt the levies by storing goods in so-called bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones.",
      "Businesses can use bonded warehouses, which are usually located near major commercial ports, to temporarily store goods, components and other inputs without immediately having to pay tariffs or taxes.",
      "\"If you make use of a warehouse or so-called foreign trade zone, you are able to delay the payment of tariffs until these goods are put into commerce,\" Daco said. \"So it's a free-trade zone, or imaginary area that is not subject to tariffs.\"",
      "Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a number of tariff exemptions and exclusions. In practice, that has resulted in the actual levies on imports often being lower than the nominal rate initially announced by the White House.",
      "As of June, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports was around 10%, compared with an official average tariff rate of 15%.",
      "Still, business can't hold the line on price hikes indefinitely if tariffs remain elevated, experts say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0told lawmakers this week\u00a0that tariffs could yet spark higher inflation, likely starting this summer,",
      "\"Part of that is due to the start-stop nature of the tariffs that have been introduced,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For us it's a question of patience more than a mystery as to where it is,\" he added. \"The typical pass-through takes some time. We expect July to be when you start to see it more.\"",

      "Mr. Trump\u00a0lashed out at Musk in an early Tuesday morning Truth Social post that noted Tesla has benefitted from federal electric vehicle tax credits \u2014 a program the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would phase out. The president also suggested DOGE should \"take a good, hard, look at\" other subsidies Musk has benefitted from.",

    "summary": "The U.S. trade war with China has sharply curbed fireworks imports. \"The timing of the tariffs couldn't have hit at a worse time,\" one industry rep says.",
    "story": [
      "Fireworks, a hallmark of July 4th celebrations, are feeling the impact of President Trump's trade war with China.",
      "More than 95% of the fireworks sold in the U.S. come from China, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. And while sales of pyrotechnics have grown in past years as more states and counties loosen restrictions, tariffs have snarled some firework importers' plans this year.",
      "For retailers, the week before July 4 is the busiest time of the year for fireworks sales. In a normal year, shelves would be fully stocked. This year, with a 30% U.S. tariff in place on imports from China, fireworks fans may find a slimmer selection and higher prices.",
      "That's because some importers asked Chinese sellers to halt orders, when sky-high 145% U.S. tariffs were in place on China. A May trade truce between the countries lowered the the levy to 30%.",
      "\"The timing of the tariffs couldn't have hit at a worse time. The majority of U.S. importers told China, 'Do not ship our product, we can't afford to pay,\" Julie Heckman, executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association, told CBS News. \"It's creating a supply-chain problem.",
      "The disruption is leading to fewer choices and higher prices for consumers this Independence Day, \u00a0according to Bill Weimer, vice president of Phantom Fireworks, a major vendor.",
      "\"On about 30% of our products, there's going to be some effect in the price,\" he told CBS News, although he noted that Phantom would absorb at least some of the higher tariff costs and not pass all of it on to consumers.",
      "As U.S. importers put orders on hold, China temporarily halted production of fireworks earlier this year. With the two countries taking steps last week to ease their trade dispute, the longer term impact on fireworks products remains to be seen.",

    "story": [
      "Last week's record-breaking heat wave\u00a0is highlighting concerns about the potential health risks facing workers.",
      "At Northside Hospital Forsyth in Cumming, Georgia, Dr. Douglas Olson, the medical director for the emergency department, said he's seen a roughly 20% increase in heat-related visits since last year across the hospital's five systems. \"Most of the time it's related to occupational heat exposure,\" he said. \"So those people that are working outside for prolonged periods \u2014 it's been pretty rough.\"",
      "The brutal temperatures in Atlanta led the death of one outdoor worker, Olson confirmed.",
      "In Dallas, a mail carrier died after collapsing on his route earlier this month as local temperatures hovered in the 90s, according to CBS News Texas. His death came roughly two years after another Dallas postal worker collapsed and died after the heat index reached 117 degrees.",
      "Federal\u00a0data\u00a0shows that 479 workers in the U.S. died from heat exposure between 2011 to 2022, an average of 40 deaths a year.",
      "People who work outside, such as construction workers, landscapers and utility workers, are more likely to get dehydrated and suffer from heat-related illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What makes such symptoms so dangerous is how quickly they can escalate.",
      "\"People have a sense of what heat-related illness looks like, but a lot of times the symptoms aren't straightforward,\" said Dr. John Purakal, assistant professor in the Duke Department of Emergency Medicine.",
      "It's not only outdoor workers who sometimes must deal with stifling heat. At a June 25 hearing hosted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, representatives for United for Respect raised concerns about the safety of Amazon workers.",
      "In one instance earlier this month, the labor advocacy group said a worker at an Amazon fulfillment center in Florida had to lift heavy freight items inside a trailer for several hours where the temperatures reached 112 degrees and where the water stations were not working properly.",
      "Sam Stephenson, an Amazon spokesperson, pushed back on those claims, saying the company's water fountains are functional and that Amazon has a rotation policy for employees tasked with with unloading heavy items that ensures they have time to rest.",
      "He added that Amazon keeps employees safe through climate control systems in buildings, air conditioning in delivery vans, and access to protective clothing and hydration. Last year, Amazon also\u00a0said it invested $59 million to cool its vans.",
      "UPS, which delivered an average of 22 million packages a day last year, also has previously drawn scrutiny over the temperature of delivery workers' trucks. In a major win for workers, the company in 2023 announced they were adding both air conditioning and fans to their trucks.",
      "A spokesperson for UPS said all newly purchased vehicles have AC and that they are adding them to their fleet as quickly as possible.",
      "\"While we don't publicly share the number of vehicles we purchase, we are prioritizing deployment in the hottest regions,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our existing delivery vehicles have been upgraded with enhanced ventilation, fans, and heat shields to improve comfort and reduce cabin temperatures.\"",
      "Pushing for a federal heat standard",
      "The U.S. has no federal heat safety standards for workers, meaning protections can vary significantly depending on the employer. In the absence of a national set of rules, a handful of\u00a0states\u00a0have introduced their own regulations to protect workers from the heat.",
      "To address the gaps, OSHA in 2024 proposed a\u00a0rule\u00a0that would require employers to create plans to safeguard employees from extreme heat. Among other provisions, it would require employers to make drinking water readily available when the heat index reaches 80 degrees and provide mandatory 15-minute rest breaks when it reaches 90 degrees.",
      "The regulatory agency is currently in the process of holding hearings to gather feedback on the rule, which OSHA\u00a0says\u00a0would be a \"significant step toward a federal heat standard to protect workers.\"",
      "A Department of Labor spokesperson declined to comment on whether the White House supports the rule. \"Once the record on the hearing closes, the Department will take everything into consideration and make a decision on how to proceed,\" they said.",

      "\"Creating a fun and respectful environment where Tinder users can be their true selves is our priority,\" a Tinder spokesperson told CBS News. \"As part of our continued efforts, we are always testing ways to deliver the best experience for our users to seek authentic connections.\"",
      "Powered by an underlying technology called FaceTec, the Face Check\u00a0feature\u00a0prompts users to take a short video of themselves which it then scans to make sure the person is who they say they are. It also tests whether a person's face matches their Tinder photos and examines other accounts to make sure no one else is using their likeness. Once verified, users get a blue checkmark on their profile.",
      "According to Tinder, verification data obtained during the face scans is stored for the lifetime of the person's account but gets deleted within 30 days after someone closes their account.",
      "\"Face Check ... is really meant to be about confirming that this person is a real, live person and not a bot or a spoofed account,\" Yoel Roth, Match Group's head of trust and safety, told the outlet.",
      "Photo verification is already one of the safety\u00a0features on Tinder, but users have to opt into it.",
      "Tinder's pilot comes amid a rise in \"romance scams,\" in which people create fake online profiles in order to win over someone's trust, oftentimes to manipulate them into giving money. U.S. Justice Department and FBI officials told CBS News\u00a0last year that there were more than 64,000 American victims of romance scams in 2023.",
      "Dating apps, including Tinder, are fertile ground for scams, according to various consumer protection sources including the FBI and Federal Trade Commission. In one case documented in the\u00a0Netflix\u00a0film \"Tinder Swindler,\" a man duped a women into giving him millions of dollars.",

      "Cleveland will begin play in 2028, Detroit in 2029 and Philadelphia the season after, assuming they get approval from the NBA and WNBA Board of Governors. Toronto and Portland will enter the league next year.",
      "\"The demand for women's basketball has never been higher, and we are thrilled to welcome Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia to the WNBA family,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said. \"This historic expansion is a powerful reflection of our league's extraordinary momentum, the depth of talent across the game, and the surging demand for investment in women's professional basketball.\"",
      "All three new teams announced Monday have NBA ownership groups. Each paid a $250 million expansion fee, which is about five times as much as Golden State dished out for a team a few years ago. All three teams will also be investing more money through building practice facilities and other such amenities.",
      "\"It's such a natural fit that when you already have this basketball-related infrastructure, these strategies, cultures that you find to be successful, combinations of personnel that you find to be successful,\" said Nic Barlage, CEO of Rock Entertainment Group and the Cavaliers. \"Extending that into the WNBA, is just a natural next progression, especially if you have a desire to grow like we do.\"",
      "Both Cleveland and Detroit had WNBA teams in the past and Philadelphia was the home for an ABL team.",
      "\"This is a huge win for Detroit and the WNBA,\" Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores said. \"Today marks the long-hoped-for return of the WNBA to a city with deep basketball roots and a championship tradition. Detroit played a key role in the league's early growth, and we're proud to reignite that legacy as the WNBA ascends to new heights. Our plans will bring new energy, investment and infrastructure to our city and the WNBA, and additional resources to our community.\"",
      "Detroit sports stars Grant Hill, Chris Webber and Jared Goff will have minority ownership stakes in the team.",
      "The Cleveland and Detroit ownership groups said the Rockers and Shock - the names of the previous teams - would be considered but they'd do their due diligence before deciding on what the franchises will be called.",
      "\"Rockers will be a part of the mix for sure, but we are at this point, we're not going to commit to a brand identity because we want to really get into it with our fans, do some research, be very thorough and thoughtful in that process,\" Barlage said.",
      "The Detroit and Cleveland teams will play at the NBA arenas that currently exist, while Philadelphia is planning on a new building that will be completed hopefully by 2030.",
      "\"We tell the city it's going to open in 2031. We're hoping for 2030,\" said Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment Managing Partner and co-founder Josh Harris, who owns the 76ers. \"So we're trying to underpromise and overdeliver. But, right now it's 2031, so that we have a year gap, you know. We've got the Xfinity center, the Wells Fargo, they'll play there.\"",
      "Adding these three teams will give the league more natural rivalries with another team on the East Coast and Detroit and Cleveland near each other.",
      "\"I think there's some great historical rivalries in the NBA among these cities and, I think that will carry over to the WNBA,\" Detroit Pistons vice president Arn Tellem said. \"I would love nothing more to have a rivalry like we do in the NBA with Cleveland and Indiana, Philadelphia and New York and all these great cities and, and I think we will.\"",
      "Other cities that bid on teams that didn't get them include St. Louis; Kansas City, Mo.; Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tenn.; Houston; Miami; Denver; and Charlotte, N.C.",
      "\"We didn't know the demand would be where the demand ended up when we ran the process last fall into the winter,\" Engelbert said. \"Given the very high demand and supply, we wanted to evaluate, too, because we're very careful about, you know, making sure we're balancing the number of roster spots, the number of teams.",
      "\"But one thing I'm very struck by as we get into a new media deal, as the media market evolves, you know, being in these three big basketball cities is going to help from a media perspective, a corporate partners perspective.\"",
      "All the metrics, such as attendance, television ratings and sponsorships, have been on the rise the last few seasons.",
      "\"You're seeing the key performance indicators around the business, but then also just the communal impact of having a women's professional sports team,\" Barlage said. \"The largest growing segment of our Cavs youth academy, which serves 60,000 kids across the state of Ohio and upstate New York, the fastest growing segment is girls. You know, it's growing at a 30% clip year over year in participation rates. And so for us to be able to create role models, to be able to create symbols of progress, to create having ambassadors within the community representing all of these things.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:08:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP Senate version of the \"big, beautiful bill\" would raise the cost of wind and solar projects by 10% to 20%, one energy group estimated.",
    "story": [
      "The latest version of the bill containing President Trump's second term agenda would hobble the renewable energy industry with a new excise tax, in addition to speeding up the sunsetting of tax credits and other benefits.",
      "The additional tax on wind and solar projects, which appeared on page 558 in the version of the bill released over the weekend, is estimated to increase consumer energy prices 8% to 10% and would tax clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an\u00a0analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax would apply to all projects that go into construction after June 16 through 2036, and it would also apply to projects that are placed into service after 2027, even if they already are under construction.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Politico Monday that she planned to introduce an amendment that would tie eligibility for the wind and solar tax credits to a project's construction start date, rather than its service date. The Senate is currently holding a marathon vote series on\u00a0proposed amendments to the bill.",
      "These wind and solar projects would have to pay the tax if a certain percentage of the value of their materials are sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. The provision is ostensibly designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components would be cost prohibitive, and some data and AI companies \u2014 which require prodigious amounts of energy \u2014 could turn to China or other countries for reliable and affordable power sources, according to clean power experts.",
      "The Senate bill also scales back or eliminates renewable energy tax breaks that have been in place since 2005 and revised and expanded a few times since then, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The most recent expansion contained tax breaks for individuals for electric vehicles, wind and solar development, and energy efficient appliances and provided tax credits for clean electricity-generating projects that went into service from 2023 through the end of 2032.",
      "Both the Senate and the House would end the renewable energy tax credits, but the Senate would accelerate the timeline in the House version, which would end the tax credits for renewable energy projects placed in service after 2028, a year later than the Senate would.",
      "Eliminating the existing tax credits would likely kill up to 72% of the new wind and solar installations that were to be completed in the U.S. over the next decade, according to analysis from Rhodium Group, a research firm.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who until Saturday was silent on the bill after his social media spat with President Trump over the House version, said of the Senate bill that it was \"Utterly insane and destructive.\"",
      "\"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,\" he said in a post on X. And he predicted it would \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\" Musk also said, \"A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.\"",
      "According to Politico, President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to further \"crack down\" on wind and solar energy by phasing out clean energy credits faster, rather than sunsetting the tax incentives more slowly, which moderate senators favored. Some asked for help easing the hit their states would take as a result of cancelled projects, job losses and higher energy prices.",
      "The renewable energy industry, manufacturing unions and even some conservatives also criticized the new tax.",
      "Conservative energy expert Alex Epstein, advocates ending the green tax credits, but he appeared to be taken by surprise by the excise tax, saying in a post on X, \"I just learned about the excise tax and it's definitely not something I would support.\"",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also quickly condemned the tax.",
      "Neil Bradly, the Chamber's executive vice president, said on social media, \"taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables.\u00a0 Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.\"",
      "The North American Building Trades Union, in a statement, called the bill potentially \"the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.\"",
      "\"Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,\" the statement continued. \"In some cases, it worsens the already harmful trajectory of the House-passed language, threatening an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs and over 3 billion work hours, which translates to $148 billion in lost annual wages and benefits.\"",

      "The Chinese company first announced its U.S. arrival last week,\u00a0posting on Instagram, \"Drip level: International. The rumors are true, NYC. You're luckin now.\" Since then, the chain has been teasing \"soft openings\" on its social media accounts, offering promotional deals to get customers in the door.",
      "Luckin did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Rapid growth in Asia",
      "Since launching in 2017, Luckin has scaled rapidly to over 24,000 stores, with locations in China, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, according to a recent financial report. Despite hiccups, including an accounting fraud scandal, and $475 million in losses last year as the company poured hundreds of millions of dollars into coffee beans, store rent and other costs, Luckin's profit margins have rapidly ballooned. This past quarter, the coffee chain made $1.2 million in revenue, a 41% increase from the year prior.",
      "The store's app-based concept, contrived by founder Jenny Zhiya Qian, was intended to echo that of a ride-hailing business, according to an analysis by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",
      "To purchase an item, Luckin customers browse the coffee store's menu and make payments directly online. This is a \"100% cashier-less environment,\" Luckin states\u00a0on its website, adding that the app-based store model is intended to maximize efficiency and keep costs low. The company's beverages in China are 30% cheaper than Starbucks beverages in the country, according to CNN.",
      "Luckin's menu offers a range of drinks from traditional items like matcha and lattes to more unconventional choices like its \"fruity Americano\" series. It also has a small pastry menu including a banana yogurt loaf,\u00a0 chocolate-chip cookie and a sausage, egg and cheese croissant, among other offerings.",
      "Competition with Starbucks",
      "Luckin's entr\u00e9e into the U.S. coffee market is a direct challenge to Starbucks, which is in the midst of revamping its brand image through the \"Back to Starbucks\" campaign as it struggles against declining sales and revenue.",
      "With more than 17,000\u00a0locations across the country, Starbucks has the upper hand in the U.S. In China, however, the Seattle-based coffee giant lost its hold to Luckin in 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported.",

    "summary": "Hundreds of thousands of workers will see more money in their paychecks starting next month due to minimum wage increases.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of thousands of workers across more than a dozen cities and states will soon receive higher pay, thanks to minimum wage hikes set to take effect July 1.",
      "More than 800,000 workers in two states \u2014Alaska and Oregon \u2014 as well as Washington, D.C., will be impacted by higher minimum wages that go into effect July 1, according to the left-leaning economic think tank Economic Policy Institute (EPI). Additionally, a dozen cities and counties are also set to boost their baseline pay rates next month.",
      "The higher minimum wages come as the federal baseline rate remains at $7.25 an hour, where it's been parked since 2009. As the cost of living has crept higher in subsequent years, some states and municipalities have boosted their own minimum wages through a combination of ballot measures, inflation adjustments and legislation.",
      "\"These minimum wage increases will put more money in workers' pockets, helping many of them and their families make ends meet,\" EPI state economic analyst Sebastian Martinez Hickey wrote in a post about the higher pay. \"The average increase in annual wages for a full-time, year-round worker resulting from these minimum wage hikes ranges from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska.\"",
      "About 58% of the workers who will receive pay hikes are women, while Black and Hispanic workers will also disproportionately benefit, according to the EPI's analysis.",
      "For example, in states where the minimum wage will increase in July, Black workers make up 7% of workers who will receive raises, but only 4.5% of the wage-earning workforce. Similarly, nearly 27% of Hispanic workers will see their wages rise, though they make up just over 13% of the wage-earning workforce.",
      "While the federal minimum wage hasn't budged in 16 years, there have been periodic attempts to boost it, with the latest coming from Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, who earlier this month introduced legislation to increase the national baseline wage to $15 per hour. He was joined by Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch as a co-sponsor.",
      "Pay hikes in Alaska, D.C., and Oregon",
      "Alaska's baseline wage will rise by $1.09 to $13.00 an hour, which was approved via a ballot measure passed by voters. The boost will impact 6.3% of the state's workforce, or 19,400 people, who will see an average annual pay increase of $925, EPI calculates.",
      "In Washington, D.C., 7.5% of the workforce, or 62,200 workers, will benefit from the minimum wage rising by 45 cents to $17.95 an hour, thanks to an inflation adjustment formula. With the new minimum in place, a full-time worker in the nation's capital will earn an additional $727 in annual wages, on average, according to the EPI's calculations.",
      "Oregon's minimum wage will rise 35 cents to $15.05 an hour on July 1, also through an inflation adjustment, boosting pay for 9.4% of the state's workforce, or 801,700 workers. The average pay hike will equate to $420 annually.",

      "President Trump said Friday that he was suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to continue with its tax on technology firms, which he called \"a direct and blatant attack on our country.\"",
      "The Canadian government said \"in anticipation\" of a trade deal \"Canada would rescind\" the Digital Serves Tax. The tax was set to go into effect Monday.",
      "Carney and Mr. Trump spoke on the phone Sunday, and Carney's office said they agreed to resume negotiations.",
      "\"Today's announcement will support a resumption of negotiations toward the July 21, 2025, timeline set out at this month's G7 Leaders' Summit in Kananaskis,\" Carney said in a statement.",
      "Carney visited Mr. Trump in May at the White House and was polite but firm. Mr. Trump traveled to Canada for the G7 summit in Alberta, where Carney said Canada and the U.S. had set a 30-day deadline for trade talks.",
      "Mr. Trump, in a post on his social media network last Friday, said Canada had informed the U.S. that it was sticking to its plan to impose the digital services tax, which applies to Canadian and foreign businesses that engage with online users in Canada.",
      "The digital services tax was due to hit companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It would have applied retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion U.S. bill due at the end of the month.",
      "Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, called Carney's retreat a \"clear victory\" for the president.",

    "summary": "He's the son of an immigrant family who fled Tehran and the Iranian revolution. He's also the chief executive officer of Uber. He talks about the road to high-tech success, and about unsettling times for a nation of immigrants.",
    "story": [
      "It's rare to sit down with a CEO and the CEO's mother. The proud mom is Lili Khosrowshahi; her son, Dara, is behind the wheel at Uber as its chief executive. \"I actually say he works for Uber,\" said Lili. \"Sometimes I say he drives, he's a driver.\"",
      "They sat down with us to share their family's immigration story. In 1978, the Khosrowshahis fled Tehran and the Iranian revolution. \"We were forced to leave Iran \u2013 it wasn't our decision,\" Lili said. \"It was done in a day.\"",
      "Dara's father ran a family business which made them wealthy, but also, they say, a target. \"You don't sit around saying, 'Well, let's plan as a family for a revolution,' right? It just never occurs to you,\" Dara said. \"We lost everything.\"",
      "\"We came from a much better life to a smaller life,\" said Lili. \"At the time, coffee was 15 cents, and I wouldn't even buy a cup of coffee. In fact, I don't pay for Starbucks coffee to this day.\"",
      "\"Mama, Starbucks is a customer of Uber Eats. You gotta talk it up!\" Dara interjected. \"I love Starbucks, personally!\"",
      "\"I'll let you pay,\" said Mom.",
      "It's that easy-going, yet strategic tone that Khosrowshahi brought to Uber. Launched in 2009, the company transformed how millions get around. When Khosrowshahi took charge in 2017, Uber was infamous for a toxic work culture and a growth-at-all-costs approach.",
      "When he took over, his job was described as \"one of the worst clean-up jobs in the history of American capitalism.\"",
      "\"Well, I think it was a little over-dramatized,\" said Khosrowshahi. \"But it was true that I had to come in and change the culture of the company. And I do think that the company, in hindsight, was too aggressive in certain ways. And I think now we get it right more than we get it wrong.\"",
      "Still, Uber is defending itself in lawsuits over its billing practices and passenger safety.",
      "Then, there's the company's relationship with President Donald Trump. Eight years ago, Khosrowshahi was CEO of Expedia \u2013 and condemned Mr. Trump's so-called Muslim ban. Today, he's one of many CEOs now engaging with President Trump.",
      "\"I do think that, as a CEO of a U.S. company, you want the country to succeed,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"And so, that means supporting whatever administration is in power. You're gonna have your disagreements. You're gonna have your agreements. We have to navigate through a period of a strong economy, but at the same time, significant uncertainty.\"",
      "I asked, \"Isn't a lot of that uncertainty caused by this president?\"",
      "\"Uncertainty comes with change,\" he replied. \"And I think the president ran on a mandate for change. As CEOs, as companies, you know, we have to adjust to that environment that we see.\"",
      "And Uber is adjusting. Last month it announced new, cheaper ride options. Route Share matches riders with other passengers along pre-set commutes.",
      "\"This feels kind of like a glorified carpool?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, what is old is new again,\" said Khosrowshahi.",
      "\"We have heard from a lot of riders that Uber rides have gotten a lot more expensive over the past few years, more than the rate of inflation \u2013 what's happening here?\"",
      "\"Well, I think it is about inflation,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"And the average Uber ride is now a little over $20. Our drivers need to make a living, and so really the demand for drivers and pay has gone up, and that translates into the ultimate price of the Uber ride.\"",
      "Concerns over driver pay and benefits persist \u2026 even as Khosrowshahi's own compensation has surged, to about $40 million a year.",
      "Asked what people should make of that, Khosrowshahi said, \"We as a society, I think as a country, clearly, we've done unbelievably well economically. But I do think that the inequality that you see as it relates to the top end compensation, like someone who's lucky enough like me, and the middle class, et cetera, that is too big a chasm, in my opinion.\"",
      "Too big of a gap? \"Yeah. I do think it's too big of a gap. Now, I don't have a solution for it.\"",
      "It's a gap that may be getting even bigger.",
      "This past week, Uber expanded its robotaxi service to Atlanta, launching rides in self-driving Waymos.",
      "Khosrowshahi said, \"Everyone wants on-demand transportation, food, et cetera. So, we see actually AV [Autonomous Vehicle] and human driving can grow for the next five to 10 years.\"",
      "\"You don't think human driver numbers will decrease?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not in the next five to 10 years,\" he replied. \"Then, we will need to adjust as a society.\"",
      "For now, robotaxis are neither cheaper nor faster than a human driver. But Khosrowshahi says they are as safe as can be. \"Certainly the statistics bear it out,\" he said.",
      "Khosrowshahi is focused on the road ahead, but his past is never far behind. When he was a teen, his father returned to Iran for what he thought would be a short visit \u2026 but the government wouldn't let him leave.",
      "Lili said, \"For the six years that your father was away, you never even mentioned his name. And I told you that Daddy was free to come, and you started crying like crazy. I mean, you couldn't stop crying. So, you know, you had learned to just hide your feelings. But as immigrants, we all learned to hide our feelings.\"",
      "Emotional, Dara requested a break from the interview. \"I don't remember the particular moment,\" he said. \"but I remember the time. And I think, you know, Mom's totally right. You adjust to the situation to your best.\"",
      "\"Adjust\" \u2026 Dara Khosrowshahi keeps coming back to that word, in work and in life.",
      "I asked, \"You have said, 'We came at a time that was welcoming to immigrants.' Is that still the case right now?\"",
      "\"I think, you know, we're going through a transition now as a nation,\" he replied. \"There's a reset going on in terms of making sure that immigration here is proper, is legal. It's difficult for a lot of people. But my hope is that we remain the kind of country that attracts the best and the brightest who want to build a life here. And  hopefully, I can help others live the same dream that I have.\"",

    "story": [
      "Americans are continually encouraged to sock away money in a 401(k) or other retirement plan to ensure a comfortable, if not cushy, life in their later years. Yet about half of all U.S. workers in the private sector lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, a huge obstacle in building enough wealth to retire, a recent study finds.",
      "About 56 million workers at businesses across the U.S. are unable to save via a retirement plan through their jobs, according to the analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts. And while these employees can in principle save money on their own, many are forced to prioritize putting food on the table and paying the bills in the present over building a nest egg for the future, the study found.",
      "The findings underscore the widening divide between the retirement haves and have-nots, with almost 30% of Americans over age 59 lacking any savings\u00a0to fall back on when they stop working. Employer-sponsored accounts like 401(k)s can help workers save because the money is taken out of paychecks automatically on a pre-tax basis, while many employers also provide a company match, which helps boost savings.",
      "\"Deeply unequal\"",
      "\"Pew's findings confirm what we've known for years: America's retirement system is deeply unequal,\" retirement expert Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and professor at the New School for Social Research, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"Nearly half of private sector workers \u2014 56 million people \u2014 lack access to workplace retirement plans. When we include gig, cash and many public-sector workers, the number grows to a staggering 83 million. That's not a gap \u2014 it's a crisis.\"",
      "About 70% of all U.S. retirement assets are held in employer-sponsored defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans, including 401(k)s and pensions, as well as in government-sponsored plans, the Congressional Research Service found in a 2023\u00a0analysis. The remainder is tucked away in individual retirement accounts, or IRAs.",
      "While it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to these plans said they faced barriers to building wealth, the Pew survey found. For instance, one-third of workers without access to an employer-sponsored retirement account said they didn't have any money left over after the end of the month.",
      "\"To build wealth and achieve financial security, individuals and families need a convenient and effective way to accumulate assets,\" Pew noted in its analysis. \"Research shows that individuals are 15 times more likely to save for retirement if money is deducted automatically from their paychecks.\"",
      "Other researchers have highlighted the gaping holes in the American retirement system. For example, one 2023 analysis from the Economic Innovation Group found that 70% of low-income workers, or those earning $37,000 or less, lack employer-sponsored plans.",
      "Creaking Social Security system",
      "While financial gurus often exhort Americans to prepare for the time they can no longer work, the Pew research makes clear that people without access to a retirement plan face significant hurdles to achieving financial security, Ghilarducci noted.",
      "\"What the Pew report confirms, and what we experts knew for years, is that saving for retirement isn't much about personal responsibility as it is about access,\" she said.",
      "Ghilarducci added, \"Without a workplace plan, even the most disciplined and financially educated worker faces structural disadvantages for saving.\"",
      "The Pew research underscores that millions of Americans will approach their retirement years reliant on Social Security as their primary \u2014 or even only \u2014 source of income in old age. At the same time, the Social Security program is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast.",
      "At that point, roughly 70 million Social Security recipients would see their monthly benefits cut by about 20%. That would likely create financial hardship for the roughly 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who today rely on the program as their sole source of income.",
      "Although lawmakers still have time overhaul the program to strengthen its finances, Congress has yet to take steps to shore up Social Security.",
      "\"The Pew report is a wake-up call,\" Ghilarducci said. \"If Congress fails to act, the people most harmed are those who can least afford it \u2014 workers without retirement accounts and pensions, gig workers, and those earning low wages.\"",

The agency's\u00a0initial first-quarter GDP report, issued in April, estimated a 0.3% decline, which was later revised to a 0.2% dip in its second print.",
      "First-quarter growth was weighed down by a surge of imports as U.S. companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs went into effect. Although a surge in imports can appear to lower economic growth because it shows a shift away from domestic consumption, that doesn't tell the whole story about the U.S. economy, experts say.",
      "A category within the GDP data called \"real final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which measures the economy's underlying strength, rose at a 1.9% annual rate from January through March. While that represents a solid number, it's down from the 2.9% pace in the fourth quarter of 2024 and from the Commerce Department's previous estimate of 2.5% January-March growth.",
      "The new data also shows that consumers sharply pared spending earlier this year, with growth at 0.5%, down from a robust 4% during the last three months of 2024. First-quarter consumer spending fell to its lowest level since the pandemic ended, with Americans particularly cutting back on recreation and dining, Greg Daco, EY-Parthenon chief economist, said in a research note.",

      "On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a House committee that businesses' rush to build their inventories earlier this year ahead of tariffs taking effect has helped delay any inflationary impacts from the import duties.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by domestic importers, all or some of the costs are typically passed onto consumers. Stocking up on inventory early in the year has allowed companies to sell those goods without the added costs of tariffs, Powell noted.",
      "\"The things that are being sold at retail now, they might have been put into inventory before the tariffs in February or March,\" the Fed chief said. \"We think we should start to see this over the summer, in the June numbers and in the July numbers.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate narrowly passed President Trump's massive tax and spending bill Tuesday after a marathon series of amendment votes that stretched more than 24 hours, delivering a major victory for the president and bringing the signature piece of legislation of his second term one step closer to his desk.",
      "The measure passed in a 51 to 50 vote, with all but three Republicans supporting the bill. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. GOP Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine joined all Democrats in voting against the bill.",
      "The vote came after the Senate worked through the weekend and into a scheduled recess to pass the bill, which now returns to the House for sign off. Mr. Trump has vowed to swiftly sign the measure, and pushed lawmakers to approve it by July 4.",
      "The legislation's passage also marks a significant victory for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who worked to sway GOP holdouts to back the legislation amid opposition on multiple fronts that threatened to thwart the bill's progress in recent days.",
      "\"This was an incredible victory for the American people,\" Thune said after the vote.",
      "Known by the GOP as the \"big, beautiful bill,\" the legislation includes ramped-up spending for border security, defense and energy production and extends trillions of dollars in tax cuts, partially offset by cuts to health care and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the legislation would increase federal deficits by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.",
      "While some Republicans had taken issue with the legislation's impact on the deficit, others cited concern with some of the steep cuts to Medicaid, which the CBO has said would leave nearly 12 million more Americans without health coverage over the coming years. And with a 53-seat majority, Senate GOP leaders could only afford to lose three Republican votes, with Vance as a tie-breaker. But those concerns were not enough to defeat the legislation, and last-minute changes secured the support of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, while apparently quelling other possible opponents to the bill.",
      "Mr. Trump welcomed news of the vote during a trip to Florida. \"There is something for everyone [in the bill], and I think it's going to go very nicely in the House,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Actually, I think it will be easier in the House than it was in the Senate.\"",
      "The path to passage",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, met with possible holdouts in his office as the vote series stretched late Monday and into the wee hours Tuesday. The majority leader met with fiscal hawks including Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rick Scott of Florida, and at another point in the night, he met with Paul, who had pledged to oppose the bill over a provision raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.",
      "Thune also talked briefly with Murkowski early Tuesday, since it appeared likely that her vote could make or break the bill in the Senate. The Alaska Republican had concerns about cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs and their impact on her state.",
      "Murkowski told reporters after the vote that her thought process on the bill was \"agonizing.\"",
      "\"I struggled mightily with the impact on the most vulnerable in this country,\" Murkowski said, citing the cuts to social safety net programs. But she outlined the unique conditions in her state, and the support Alaska received in the final version of the bill, saying \"I had to look on balance because people in my state are the ones that I put first.\"",
      "In a statement later in the afternoon, Murkowski said, \"My sincere hope is that this is not the final product.\"",
      "\"This bill needs more work across chambers and is not ready for the President's desk,\" she wrote. \"We need to work together to get this right.\"",
      "Senate Republicans advanced the legislation late Saturday, with all but two voting in favor following hours of delay as the GOP worked to iron out last-minute details and dispel concern among holdouts, including the fiscal hawks, Murkowski and Collins.",
      "Paul and Tillis were the two Republicans to oppose the bill's advancement Saturday, and they both voted against the legislation on final passage. With a handful of other possible opponents, Thune told reporters overnight that GOP leaders were working to determine what \"everybody has to have in terms of votes,\" a sign that the vote would come down to the wire.",
      "The Senate action comes after the House narrowly passed the bill last month. Senate Republicans worked to put their mark on the legislation, treading carefully so as not to throw off the delicate balance in the lower chamber.",
      "The House will need to approve the Senate's changes to the bill before it can head to the president's desk for his signature. And lawmakers are trying to move quickly, with a self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the measure signed. The House could return to Washington as early as Wednesday to begin consideration of the revised bill.",
      "Senate Republicans passed the legislation through the budget reconciliation process, which enables the party in the majority to move ahead without support from across the aisle. The Senate worked through the weekend as the GOP entered a final sprint on the legislation ahead of the July 4 deadline.",
      "Senate Democrats combatted the legislation in one of the only ways available to them: by delaying the process. Democrats forced the bill to be read in its entirety over the weekend, totaling nearly 16 hours, before using debate time to rail against the bill, and proposing amendments to put their GOP colleagues on the record on a number of controversial issues ahead of the midterm elections.",
      "On Monday, the Senate began what's known as a \"vote-a-rama,\" in which senators could offer an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to cast vote after vote. Democrats proposed a number of amendments to attempt to roll back some of the bill's more controversial provisions, to no avail. As the votes stretched overnight Monday and into Tuesday, senators voted on a handful of notable amendments, including a near-unanimous vote to eliminate language from the bill that would have put a pause on state regulations on artificial intelligence. The Senate also approved an amendment to move up Medicaid eligibility verification requirements preventing payments for people who are deceased.",
      "An amendment proposed by Collins that would have increased the rural hospital stabilization fund from $25 billion to $50 billion and imposed a higher tax rate on the wealthy to pay for the larger fund fell short. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters ahead of the vote that the amendment was like putting a \"band aid on an amputation \u2014 it doesn't fix the problem.\" The outcome made it less likely that Collins would ultimately support the bill, although the change was expected to be included in a wide-ranging amendment to the bill.",
      "During the marathon vote series, the Senate also addressed an outstanding disagreement over the current policy baseline, an accounting approach that would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing. Though Democrats railed against the move as the \"nuclear option,\" the chamber voted along party lines to affirm the use of the current policy baseline.",
      "Schumer lambasted the bill after the vote, criticizing Republicans for bowing to the president.",
      "\"The American people will remember the Republican betrayal,\" Schumer said.",
      "Cristina  Corujo, \n                                                  \n                                  Emily  Hung and \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island has blocked the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing mass layoffs and overhauling some of its sub-agencies, finding there to be \"no rational basis\" for the Trump administration's reorganization plans that would have \"devastating consequences\" across the country if enacted.",
      "The suit was brought by 19 Democratic attorneys general and Washington, D.C., in May, seeking to block an agency restructuring plan announced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in March.",
      "Their complaint warned of \"severe, complicated, and potentially irreversible\" consequences to public health services nationwide if the plan went forward, potentially \"paralyzing\" the agency \"by means of a confusing reorganization.\"",
      "\"Critical public health services have been interrupted, databases taken offline, status of grants thrown into chaos, technical assistance services gone, and training and consultation services curtailed. These are not unsubstantiated fears,\" Judge Melissa DuBose wrote in her opinion granting the states' request for a preliminary injunction.",
      "\"HHS has failed to produce a shred of evidence that services to States and access to critical information would continue uninterrupted, that the harms are minimal or not irreparable, or that it is authorized to act absent Congressional action,\" she added.",
      "The judge also ordered the parties to address whether and how the Supreme Court's recent ruling limiting universal injunctions should apply to her order. In that case, which stemmed from President Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court limited the use of universal injunctions in cases with individuals as plaintiffs, but gave lower courts more latitude in cases brought by states.",
      "The states had cited concerns with the restructuring at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FDA's tobacco products center, the Office of Head Start and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.",
      "\"The Executive Branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,\" DuBose wrote.",
      "As part of Kennedy's restructuring plan, he moved to lay off some 10,000 employees at the nation's health agencies and ordered remaining officials to draw up plans to reorganize their work. Several offices and teams are slated to move under the plans, many into a new agency Kennedy wants to create called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA.",
      "Most of those employees remain off the job after getting their layoff notices in April but are still being paid, due to cases that sought to block their terminations.",
      "\"HHS is the backbone of our nation's public health and social safety net \u2014 from cancer screenings and maternal health to early childhood education and domestic violence prevention,\" said New York Attorney General James in a statement after the ruling.",
      "In May, a federal court in California blocked the Trump administration's mass layoff attempts, including at HHS, though the Supreme Court is considering whether to lift a lower court's injunction and allow it to move forward with the administration's plans for reductions in force, or layoffs.",
      "\"The people who were subject to the reduction in force are on administrative leave, and they will remain on administrative leave until the injunction is lifted,\" Kennedy said at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing last week.",
      "Multiple federal health officials said planning has been ongoing for the next steps of the reorganization and merger, even as Kennedy has cited the court rulings as a reason to dodge questions about the restructuring on Capitol Hill.",
      "Officials from the Health Resources and Services Administration visited the CDC's campuses in Atlanta in recent weeks, they said, in a meeting of senior leaders between the two agencies.",
      "Most remaining teams focused on chronic disease from the two agencies are supposed to start being transferred into the new AHA agency, Kennedy has said, if the injunction is lifted.",
      "A few hundred layoffs have also been reversed in the weeks since the initial cuts, including those of scientists, researchers and health officials the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and the FDA.",
      "But officials have also been told that further layoffs might be demanded by the Trump administration from health agencies in order to \"balance out\" the jobs that were restored.",
      "\"At that point, we will make decisions. And, you know, in some cases, there have been gaps in our ability to perform our duties. I've brought people back,\" Kennedy said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Tuesday narrowly passed a massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump's second-term agenda in a 51-50 vote that required Vice President JD Vance to break a tie.",
      "The vote came after a marathon session that featured votes on amendments to key portions of the bill by senators of both parties.",
      "At the center of what Republicans call the \"big, beautiful bill\"\u00a0is an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is slated to sunset at year's end. The legislation would make most of the tax cuts permanent, while increasing spending for border security, defense and energy production.",
      "The bill is partially paid for by cuts to health care and nutrition programs, like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the Senate's bill would add $3.3 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years and leave millions without health insurance. Republicans and the White House dispute those forecasts.",
      "Senate Republicans used a process known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, which limits the types of policies that can be included in a simple majority vote. A handful of provisions that initially appeared in the bill were ultimately removed, including one that would have ordered the sale of public lands and another that would have paused state regulations on artificial intelligence.",
      "The House passed its own version of the legislation last month, with some key differences. The lower chamber must now approve the Senate's version before it can go to the president's desk. If the House makes changes of its own, the Senate would need to sign off on those as well.",
      "Here's what is in the 887-page bill:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. Like the House-passed bill, the legislation imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. But the Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, isn't in compliance with Senate reconciliation rules.",
      "The parliamentarian also weighed in on the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in recent weeks. It's a departure from the House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $50 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Homeland security and immigration",
      "The legislation includes more than $46.5 billion for border wall construction and related expenses, $45 billion to expand detention capacity for immigrants in custody and about $30 billion in funding for hiring, training and other resources for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "It also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The Senate bill still shifts the costs of SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "The package also aligns with the House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18 and 54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18 and 64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the House-passed bill. Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, saying that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress are aiming to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the Senate bill, $300 less than the House-passed hike. The House version reverts the increase to $2,000 after 2028.",
      "Limits on overtime and tips deductions",
      "The bill would allow individuals to deduct a certain amount of tip wages and overtime from their taxes. The provisions would expire in 2028.",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate\u00a0versions\u00a0vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Changes to standard deduction",
      "The Senate wants to permanently expand the basic standard deduction, which was nearly doubled in 2017. The increases will expire at the end of the year. The House bill, however, would expand the deduction only through 2028.",

      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who would benefit?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all would benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants would qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees would not despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

      "An Afghan man who worked alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan was placed in expedited removal in San Diego on Thursday, June 26, according to court documents reviewed by CBS News. Sayed Naser was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on June 12 when he appeared at the San Diego federal courthouse for his mandatory immigration hearing.",
      "\"DHS elected to exercise its broad discretion to dismiss removal proceedings and instead place the respondent in expedited removal within two years of his entry date,\" says the order signed by Judge Catherin Halliday-Roberts. The judge's order said Naser is still eligible to be interviewed by an asylum officer if he fears return to his home country.",
      "Shawn VanDiver, executive director for #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that advocates for U.S. wartime allies, criticized the ruling, saying, \"A bureaucrat technically just stripped a wartime ally of his legal protections and fast-tracked him for deportation.\"",
      "\"Sayed stood with U.S. forces in combat. Now he faces removal without a lawyer, without a hearing and possibly without a country. This isn't just cruel, it's cowardly,\" VanDiver said.",
      "Since his arrest, Naser \u2014 whose full name is being withheld because of safety concerns \u2014 has been held in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, according to his lawyer, Brian McGoldrick.",
      "Naser will soon participate in a \"credible threat\" interview over the phone with an officer from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, but it is not clear from the order when the interview will take place. If he can demonstrate that he would face significant harm in his home country, he will be allowed to reapply for asylum.",
      "If he does not pass his credible fear interview, he will be deported to an unknown third-party country, says McGoldrick. He said if Naser were to return to Afghanistan, he would face \"certain death,\" although a return to his origin country was unlikely given the U.S. doesn't have diplomatic relations with the country under the Taliban.",
      "Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could resume deportations to third-party countries. McGoldrick said that Naser could be sent to Kosovo or South Sudan.",
      "In a statement shared by #AfghanEvac, Naser said\u00a0he worked with the American government in Afghanistan and followed all the legal processes for immigrating to the U.S. Now, he said he sits in detention, punished and treated like a \"criminal.\"",
      "\"Please \u2014 don't turn your back on us,\" Naser's statement reads. \"Keep your promises. Let me live in peace with my family in this country I love.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News last week, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Naser entered the U.S. \"unvetted\" via the CBP One app under the Biden administration in 2024.

      "In a video obtained by CBS News, two unidentified ICE agents put Naser in handcuffs and escorted him from the courthouse on June 12.",
      "An Afghan ally who served alongside U.S. forces was legally paroled into the U.S. and showed up for his first hearing.@DHSGov detained him anyway\u2014using a vague \u201cimprovidently issued\u201d excuse.He followed the rules.We have the video.This must stop.#AfghanEvac #DueProcess pic.twitter.com/zZXjzQUDMT",
      "\"For more than three years I worked for the U.S. military back in my home country,\" Naser said in the video as the masked officers took him into custody. \"I came here to make a better life. I didn't know this was going to happen like this for me.\"",
      "Naser was legally paroled into the U.S in 2024, according to immigration case files reviewed by CBS News. In addition to an active asylum case, he has a pending Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) case because of his long history supporting the U.S. military. SIVs are provided to foreign nationals who worked with U.S. military forces\u00a0in war zones including Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Naser has no criminal record in the U.S. or Afghanistan, according to court records reviewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This man served with our troops. He came through the front door. He followed every rule. And we locked him up anyway,\" said\u00a0 VanDiver. He said it's unknown how many Afghan allies have been detained by ICE officials.",
      "Naser served as a civilian interpreter for the U.S. military in Afghanistan from 2015 to 2018. He and his brothers also co-owned a logistics company that provided anti-mining support to American troops, according to employment records viewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This individual was an important part of our Company commitment to provide the best possible service for our clients, who were the United States Military in Afghanistan,\" says one employment document submitted as part of Naser's SIV application.",
      "But after the U.S. withdrew from the country in August 2021, his partnership with American forces put targets on the backs of Naser and his family. In 2023, Taliban fighters killed his brother and abducted his father at a family wedding. The attack drove Naser out of the country and forced his wife and children to flee their home.",
      "\"I cannot return to Afghanistan under any circumstances because I am accused of collaborating with U.S. forces. From the Taliban's perspective, anyone who worked with foreign forces during the past 20 years is a spy, an infidel, and must be killed,\" Naser wrote in his asylum declaration. His family remains in hiding outside of Afghanistan.",
      "After his brother was killed, Naser fled to Brazil, where he was granted a humanitarian visa. He then made the more than 6,000 mile journey on foot through the Dari\u00e9n Gap before reaching Mexico. In 2024, he set up an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection through the app formerly known as CBP One \u2014 which allowed migrants to schedule appointments at legal ports of entry \u2014 where he was granted lawful parole into the U.S.",
      "As part of his asylum process, Naser was required to attend an in-person hearing last week in front of a judge and a lawyer from the Department of Homeland Security. But when Naser showed up to court, the DHS lawyer said that his case was \"'improvidently issued.\"",
      "\"Nobody knows what that means,\" said McGoldrick, who tried to dispute the ruling. When pressed, the DHS lawyer refused to clarify further.",
      "\"'Improvidently issued' is becoming ICE's new catch-all \u2014 a vague, unchallengeable justification being used to clear dockets and meet removal and detention quotas,\" said VanDiver. \"It's being weaponized to put lawful, parole-compliant asylum-seekers in cells.\"",
      "When Naser left the courtroom after his hearing ended, he was immediately detained by ICE agents.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS said Naser \"entered the U.S. unvetted via the CBP One app under the previous administration in 2024. There is nothing in his immigration records indicating that he assisted the U.S. government in any capacity. All of his claims will be heard by a judge. Any Afghan who fears persecution is able to request asylum.\"",
      "Naser is now being held in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego. According to McGoldrick, he could be kept there for up to three months while his asylum case is adjudicated. If he is denied asylum, Naser will be put on an expedited removal list and likely deported. His lawyer does not know where he would be deported to.",
      "\"He's still in shock. He cannot believe this is happening to him,\" McGoldrick said.",
      "Naser's wife, who remains in hiding with their children, found out about her husband's detention when she saw the video of his detainment on social media.",
      "Increase in arrests in courthouses",
      "The last few weeks have seen an increase in ICE arrests outside of immigration hearings in courthouses around major American cities. In May, CBS News reported that the Trump administration was launching an operation to expedite the deportation of certain migrants by dismissing their cases and subsequently arresting them at courthouses around the country. The move shocked immigration advocates, as their clients are legally required to show up at their hearings.",
      "Public arrests outside courts in Los Angeles led to more than a week of demonstrations as protesters faced off against thousands of law enforcement officials, including the National Guard.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump called on ICE to increase arrests in order to achieve his goal of the \"largest Mass Deportation Operation of Illegal Aliens in History,\" according to a post on Truth Social, the social media platforms he owns.",
      "Reports from within the administration say that White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have been pushing agencies since late May to meet a higher quota of deportations \u2014 including as much as 3,000 immigration-related arrests per day.",
      "Typically, ICE agents need probable cause in order to detain someone to check their immigration status. This requires a higher standard of evidence pointing to an individual's alleged violation of immigration law.",
      "It's not clear in Naser's case what evidence there is that he was violating the law, his lawyer said. ICE provided a warrant for Naser's arrest to his attorney outside the courtroom after he was detained.",
      "\"It's really shocking what's happening in courthouses in San Diego and around the country,\" said McGoldrick. \"You walk down the hall and it's like you're walking down executioner's row. There's all these armed personnel just eyeballing everybody as we come down. It's just so intimidating that our clients are terrorized.\"",
      "Uncertain future for thousands of Afghans",
      "The Trump administration has demonstrated a sharp turn away from supporting Afghans who worked with the U.S. government in the military's two-decade-long conflict with the Taliban.",
      "In May, Noem announced that the administration was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Afghans. TPS is an immigration designation that allows people from countries deemed dangerous by the U.S. to live and work in the United States without being detained by DHS. Nearly 11,000 Afghans who are in the U.S. under TPS will be at risk of deportation when the change in policy comes into effect in mid-July, said VanDiver.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration also instituted a travel ban on nationals from Afghanistan and 11 other countries, citing a need to address security concerns. Ahead of this announcement, over 100,000 Afghan wartime allies and their families had been vetted and cleared to enter the U.S., says #AfghanEvac. They are now unable to travel to the U.S. unless they are granted an SIV visa and can fund their own travel, without government support. Many live in danger of retribution from the Taliban.",
      "\"Afghanistan remains under the control of the Taliban. There are still assassinations, arbitrary arrests, and ongoing human rights abuses, especially against women and ethnic minorities,\" said VanDiver. \"The United States cannot abandon its allies and call that immigration policy.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 13:32:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Senate and House Republicans would each cut Medicaid spending significantly, and there are some differences between the two bills.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans plan to slash Medicaid funding to help offset the tax cuts and new spending included in President Trump's massive domestic policy bill. There are some differences between the approaches taken by Senate and House Republicans, making Medicaid among the most divisive issues lawmakers have had to navigate in recent months.",
      "Staring down a self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the \"big, beautiful bill\" to Mr. Trump's desk, Republican lawmakers have yet to settle their differences. The Senate version, which passed narrowly on Tuesday, is expected to face some resistance in the House, which passed a separate version in May. No Democrats are expected to support the bill.",
      "Medicaid cuts",
      "About 71 million Americans are enrolled in Medicaid, according to the government's most recent data. According to a Congressional Budget Office report published late Saturday, the changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act in the Senate version would result in an increase of nearly 12 million more uninsured people by 2034.",
      "The House-passed version would leave slightly fewer without health insurance \u2014 nearly 11 million \u2014 by 2034, mostly due to cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, the CBO estimated earlier in June.",
      "The Senate version makes $930 billion in cuts over a decade to Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, according to the CBO. The House-passed bill includes nearly $800 billion in cuts.",
      "Work requirements",
      "Both versions include new work requirements for the popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans and people with disabilities. They require adults to work, volunteer or study 80 hours a month to qualify for enrollment, unless they have an exception.",
      "The House-passed bill includes work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64, beginning no later than 2026. There are exemptions for caregivers for dependent children or for pregnant women, among others.",
      "The Senate version expands the House bill by requiring parents of children over the age of 14 to work.",
      "Reporting requirements",
      "Both the Senate and the House would require Medicaid recipients to prove their eligibility twice a year, instead of annually.",
      "Home equity and Medicaid",
      "Under both chambers, applicants wouldn't qualify for Medicaid if their home equity is valued at more than $1 million, regardless of inflation. Under current law, state-determined maximum limits on home equity are between $730,000 and $1,097,000 and are indexed to inflation.",
      "Preventing Medicaid payments to dead people",
      "The Senate approved an amendment to move up Medicaid eligibility verification requirements, a measure aimed at preventing payments for people who are deceased. This was originally supposed to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2028, and Republican Sen. John Kennedy's amendment moved it to Jan. 1, 2027.",
      "Provider taxes",
      "States can boost federal Medicaid contributions to their states through what's known as a provider tax, often levying taxes on health care providers, which raises the overall cost of a service and therefore increases the portion reimbursed by the state.",
      "The House measure aims to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "But their Senate counterparts want to incrementally lower provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032 in states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0Forty states have adopted the Medicaid expansion, and under that provision, the federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion enrollees while the states are responsible for 10%. The federal government's portion for those covered through traditional Medicaid can range from 50% to 83%.",
      "Senate Republicans also added a $25 billion fund to help rural hospitals after some GOP senators expressed concern about how they could be affected by the change to provider taxes.",
      "Gender transition care",
      "The House bill prohibits federal Medicaid funding from covering gender transition services for children and adults, including surgeries, hormone therapy and puberty blockers.",
      "The Senate version included a similar provision, but the parliamentarian determined that it did not comply with the chamber's rules guiding the reconciliation process, meaning it either needed to be removed or modified to be included.",
      "Planned Parenthood funding",
      "Conservatives have long tried to stop Planned Parenthood from receiving federal funds. The Hyde Amendment bans the use of any federal funds for abortion, but Planned Parenthood receives Medicaid money for other services.",
      "Both versions seek to strip Planned Parenthood from receiving any Medicaid payments. The Senate version stops the payments for one year, while the House version ends them for 10 years.",
      "Limits on retroactive coverage",
      "Currently, states must cover Medicaid benefits retroactively for three months before an eligible individual signs up for coverage. The Senate and House bills would reduce that to one month.",
      "Co-payments for services",
      "For those whose incomes are over 100% of the federal poverty level, which in 2025 is $15,650 for an individual and $32,150 for a family of four, states would be required to impose co-payments of up to $35 for medical services, with some exclusions, including for primary care. Both the Senate and House bills contain this provision, but the Senate version would make exceptions for certain types of health care providers.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday toured the site of a new immigration detention center in South Florida that state officials are calling \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are visiting the facility alongside the president. The controversial detention facility is at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in the Florida Everglades, which has its own runway in an environment known for its treacherous terrain and wildlife. Mr. Trump joked in his remarks that \"we're going to teach them how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison.\"",
      "Mr. Trump invited the press to join his tour of the makeshift facility, which he called \"so professional and so well done.\" Rows of bunk beds were lined up behind chain fences.",
      "The president was asked if it could be a model going forward for other detention sites. \"It can be,\" he responded, adding that such a location is rare. Mr. Trump said he'd like to see similar temporary facilities in \"many states.\"",
      "DeSantis said they expect the first occupants of the detention center to arrive Wednesday. DeSantis said the site has been modified in just eight days to accommodate detainees, and he called the center an \"effective way\" to increase the numbers of removals and deportations of unauthorized immigrants as the state seeks to help the federal government's deportation efforts.",
      "The facility will have up to several thousand beds to house, process and deport individuals who were in the country illegally. Florida officials say the site will have at least 200 security cameras, at least 28,000 feet of barbed wire, 400-plus security personnel, and 24/7 air conditioning.",
      "In a roundtable alongside Mr. Trump, Noem told people who are in the country illegally and who may be watching on TV that they can still \"self-deport\" and get the chance to return to the United States legally in the future.",
      "\"If you don't, you may end up here,\" Noem said. \"And you may end up here and being processed, deported out of this country, and never get the chance to come back.\"",
      "DeSantis echoed Noem's message. \"Why would you want to come through 'Alligator Alcatraz' if you can just go home on your own?\" DeSantis said. \" I think a lot of people are going to make that decision.\"",
      "Protesters have gathered outside the gates as construction work proceeded on the site in recent days, and a crowd of demonstrators turned out again Tuesday to protest Mr. Trump's visit, CBS News Miami reported.",
      "Phyllis Andrews, a retired teacher who drove in from Naples, Florida, to join the protest, told The Associated Press, \"I have a lot of immigrants I have been working with. They are fine people. They do not deserve to be incarcerated here.\"",
      "Noem announced last week that the detention facilities in Florida will be funded \"in large part\" by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as part of FEMA's shelter and services program, an initiative created by Congress to support groups and cities receiving migrants and asylum-seekers released from federal custody along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\"There is only one road leading in and the only way out is a one-way flight,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday. \"It is isolated, and surrounded by dangerous wildlife in unforgiving terrain.\"",
      "\"They ain't going anywhere once they're there, unless you want them to go somewhere,\" DeSantis said Monday. \"Because good luck getting to civilization. So the security is amazing \u2014 natural and otherwise.\"",
      "Critics of the project include former U.S. Rep. David Jolly, an ex-Republican who is now running for Florida governor as a Democrat, who called the facility a \"callous political stunt.\"",
      "Where is \"Alligator Alcatraz\"? Map shows site in South Florida",
      "The site of the temporary migrant detention facility in Ochopee, Florida, is located deep in the Everglades, about 50 miles west of Miami, in a wetlands ecosystem known as Big Cypress Swamp.",
      "History of \"Alligator Alcatraz\" site in Florida Everglades",
      "According to the\u00a0National Park Service, Florida officials in the 1960s proposed building a futuristic jetport in the area to support South Florida's booming population. The Dade County Port Authority purchased 39 square miles of remote swampland with plans to build what would have been the largest airport in the world.",
      "But opposition to the Everglades Jetport grew, and the early work on the facility halted in 1970 after a federal report determined that it would \"inexorably destroy the South Florida ecosystem and thus the Everglades National Park.\"",
      "Instead, in the 1970s, a smaller portion of the land was developed into the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, known as TNT, an aviation training facility with only one runway.",
      "The site has about 900 acres of developed and operational land, while the remaining area is managed and operated by the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission.",
      "On June 19, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier proposed using the TNT site for a temporary facility to house U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees. He said the facility could be set up on the already constructed runway.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration recently transferred immigration detainees from countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Caribbean to detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration recently transferred immigration detainees from countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Caribbean to detention facilities at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, dramatically expanding the nationalities of those held there, internal U.S. government records obtained by CBS News show.",
      "As of earlier this week, Guantanamo Bay's immigration detainees \u2014 who are detained separately from the terrorism suspects also held at the U.S. military base \u2014 included nationals of China, Jamaica, Liberia and the United Kingdom, according to the federal documents.",
      "Two U.S. officials said most of those detained at the base are considered to be \"high-risk\" detainees, who are defined by immigration authorities as individuals with violent or otherwise serious criminal records, histories of disruptive behavior or alleged gang ties.",
      "The transfers, which had not been previously reported, signal a significant expansion in the Trump administration's efforts to turn parts of Guantanamo Bay into immigration detention facilities to hold foreigners facing deportation.",
      "Since President Trump ordered his administration to detain \"high-priority\" foreigners with criminal records at the base earlier this year, the facilities there have mainly housed Spanish-speaking Latin American detainees from countries such as Nicaragua and Venezuela before their formal deportation.",
      "But the decision to use Guantanamo Bay to hold immigration detainees from more far-flung nations in Africa, Asia and Europe underscores the broad scope of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "A defense official told CBS News there were 54 immigration detainees at Guantanamo Bay on Tuesday.",
      "It's unclear why exactly the administration decided to transfer detainees from Asia, Africa and Europe to Guantanamo Bay. But the immigration detention system in the U.S. is well over its congressionally funded capacity, as ICE has increased efforts throughout the country to arrest immigrants in the U.S. illegally.",
      "In early June, Politico reported that officials were vetting thousands of detainees from different countries, including European allies, for a potential transfer to Guantanamo Bay, a report that the White House denied at the time.",
      "Representatives for the Departments of Homeland Security and State did not answer a series of questions, including on whether the African, Asian and European detainees are expected to be deported from Guantanamo Bay.",
      "The Trump administration's use of Guantanamo Bay to further its mass deportation agenda has garnered strong criticism and legal challenges from civil rights advocates, who argue the government does not have the authority to hold immigration detainees outside of the U.S. The base, which sits on Cuban land, was controversial before it became an immigration holding center, due to the indefinite detention of terrorism suspects, some of whom faced torture and abuse.",
      "While top Trump administration officials like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller have repeatedly highlighted the detention efforts at Guantanamo Bay, they have provided scant public information on operations at the base and who is being sent there.",
      "Reporting by CBS News and other news organizations has confirmed that the administration has sent both detainees deemed to be \"high-risk\" and \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo Bay, including Venezuelan men whose relatives have denied accusations that they were gang members.",
      "Those classified as \"high-risk\" have been detained at Guantanamo Bay's Camp VI, a part of the post-9/11 prison that still holds roughly a dozen terrorism suspects, though in a separate section of the complex.",
      "The \"low-risk\" detainees \u2014 who by definition lack a serious criminal record or any record at all, beyond civil immigration violations \u2014 have been housed at the Migrant Operations Center, a barrack-like facility on the base historically used to accommodate asylum-seekers interdicted at sea.",
      "CBS News also revealed in May an internal government memo showing that officials created a broad set of criteria for who could be sent to Guantanamo Bay that did not mention criminality, despite the president saying that only individuals who he called \"the worst\" would be held at the base.",
      "The Department of Defense told Congress in May that as of April 8 it had spent $21 million flying immigration detainees to Guantanamo Bay, or more than $26,000 per flight hour.",
      "As of Tuesday, the base's Camp 6 prison and Migrant Operations Center were housing 41 and 13 detainees, respectively, a defense official said.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to send a message of deterrence by using or proposing controversial detention centers like Guantanamo Bay to hold those accused of violating U.S. immigration law.",
      "In March, the administration flew more than 200 Venezuelans it labeled gang members to El Salvador, which imprisoned them at CECOT, its infamous maximum-security prison. More recently, the Trump administration has announced it is working with Florida state officials to set up an immigration detention center in the wetlands of the Everglades. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump visited the facility, which officials have dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump previously said diplomatic talks could resume as early as this week, but Iran's foreign minister said he didn't think they would \"restart as quickly as that.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump recently indicated diplomatic talks with Iran could restart as soon as this week, although the White House noted no talks were officially scheduled. After U.S. airstrikes on some of Iran's nuclear facilities, followed days later by a\u00a0ceasefire to end what Mr. Trump called the\u00a012-day war between Iran and Israel, Iran's foreign minister seemed less certain about a speedy return to diplomacy.",
      "\"I don't think negotiations will restart as quickly as that,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CBS News through a translator.",
      "\"In order for us to decide to reengage, we will have to first ensure that America will not revert back to targeting us in a military attack during the negotiations,\" Araghchi said in his first interview with an American media outlet inside Iran since the bombings. \"And I think with all these considerations, we still need more time.\"",
      "However, Araghchi also insisted, \"The doors of diplomacy will never slam shut.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said during a televised address following the American strikes on June 21 that Iran's Fordo nuclear enrichment site and the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear facilities had been \"completely and totally obliterated.\" Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a news conference, \"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction.\"",
      "Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency,\u00a0told CBS News the U.S. strikes caused \"severe damage, but it's not total damage.\" Grossi said Iran could likely start enriching uranium again within a few months.",
      "\"One cannot obliterate the technology and science for enrichment through bombings,\" Araghchi said. \"If there is this will on our part, and the will exists in order to once again make progress in this industry, we will be able to expeditiously repair the damages and make up for the lost time.\"",
      "When asked if Iran intends to continue enriching uranium, Araghchi said the country's \"peaceful nuclear program has turned into a matter of national pride and glory. We have also gone through 12 days of imposed war, therefore, people will not easily back down from enrichment.\"",
      "After 12 days of missile exchanges between Iran and Israel, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared victory, writing on social media, \"I offer my congratulations on the victory over the fallacious Zionist regime,\" and claiming Israel's government was \"practically knocked out and crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded on social media, calling Khamenei's declaration a lie, saying Iran had been \"decimated\" and claiming he prevented both the U.S. and Israeli militaries from assassinating the supreme leader.",
      "Mr. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet at the White House next Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump has also indicated he could order strikes on Iran again should it resume enriching uranium beyond a certain level. Araghchi questioned the legality of such action and said Iran was prepared for more attacks.",
      "\"We showed and proved during this 12-day imposed war that we have the ability to defend ourselves, and we will continue to do so should any aggression be launched against us,\" he said.",

      "\"No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!\"",
      "Musk, who had an acrimonious public falling out with the president over the budget bill, ramped up his criticism of the massive tax and domestic policy package Monday, suggesting he could support primary challenges against Republicans who vote for it.",
      "\"Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!\" the billionaire and onetime Trump ally wrote in a\u00a0post on X. \"And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.\"",
      "Musk\u00a0also suggested\u00a0starting \"a new political party that actually cares about the people\" on Monday, an\u00a0idea he first floated\u00a0earlier this month.

      "Mr. Trump is hoping to seal his legacy with the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" which would extend his expiring first-term tax cuts at a cost of $4.5 trillion and beef up border security.",
      "But Republicans eyeing 2026 midterm congressional elections are divided over the package, which would strip health care from millions of the poorest Americans and add to the country's debt.",
      "As lawmakers began voting on the bill on Monday, Musk \u2014 the world's richest person \u2014 accused Republicans of supporting \"debt slavery.\"",
      "\"All I'm asking is that we don't bankrupt America,\" he said on social media Tuesday. \"What's the point of a debt ceiling if we keep raising it?\"",

    "summary": "A controversial federal National Guard deployment to Los Angeles could lose some troops to wildfire duty.",
    "story": [
      "A military commander has discussed shifting some California National Guard troops away from the Trump administration's weekslong deployment to deal with protests in Los Angeles so they can help fight wildfires, two U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "Gen. Gregory Guillot, the leader of U.S. Northern Command, made the request to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, proposing that 200 out of roughly 4,000 California National Guard members be returned to wildfire duty in California.",
      "The request to shift some troops to wildfire duty was first reported by The Associated Press.",
      "The purpose of the possible move is to help prepare for wildfire season, one U.S. official said. The other official said the 200 Guard members could be returned to the California National Guard and placed on standby to respond to wildfires.",
      "Wildfires can happen at any time of year in California, but they usually peak in the summer and fall. The state expects an \"early and active season\" this year, with above-average activity in July and August, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.",
      "The Los Angeles deployment has been controversial and subject to legal challenges. President Trump called up around 4,000 Guard members \u2014 and deployed around 700 Marines \u2014 over California Gov. Gavin Newsom's objections, moves Mr. Trump argued were necessary to protect federal buildings and immigration agents from chaotic protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Newsom argued the deployment was illegal and unnecessary.",
      "When Mr. Trump initially called up the California National Guard to deal with protests, the state had warned the move could interfere with its wildfire response. Guard forces often work alongside Cal Fire crews \u2014 and as wildfires become more frequent and severe, state officials have said more resources are needed. Newsom's office said last week the Guard's firefighting force was only at 40% capacity due to the Los Angeles deployment.",
      "\"This deployment comes when California is in the midst of peak wildfire season for both Northern and Southern California and may need to rely on their crucial support,\" the state of California wrote in a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the deployment.",
      "A federal district court judge initially sided with the state in its lawsuit, but a panel of appellate court judges paused that ruling, allowing Mr. Trump to maintain control of the Guard.",
      "The troops were shifted to federal service earlier this month under a law known as Title 10, which lets the president call up National Guard forces during a \"rebellion\" or if \"the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\" The Trump administration argued those conditions were met due to threats of violence against immigration agents who carried out arrests in the Los Angeles area.",
      "Newsom objected to the move, and the state quickly filed a lawsuit calling it a \"power grab.\" The state argued that under the law cited by the administration, Mr. Trump does not have the legal authority to call up the Guard without permission from the governor.",
      "A three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ultimately sided with the Trump administration, allowing troops to remain in Los Angeles while the state's lawsuit is heard. The court wrote that Mr. Trump most likely \"lawfully exercised his statutory authority\" to federalize the Guard, and that the law \"does not give governors any veto power.\"",

    "summary": "Colin Allred, who lost to Sen. Ted Cruz last year, will run for Senate again in a closely watched 2026 contest.",
    "story": [
      "Former Texas Democratic Rep. Colin Allred formally launched his 2026 U.S. Senate campaign Tuesday morning, entering what is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched races of the cycle.",
      "A former NFL linebacker, Allred represented the Dallas area in the House for three terms before mounting an unsuccessful challenge to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2024.",
      "So far, much of the early attention in the Texas race has centered on the increasingly bitter Republican primary, where Attorney General Ken Paxton \u2014 a staunch ally of President Trump \u2014 is challenging longtime GOP Sen. John Cornyn.",
      "The 2026 race is emerging as a key target for national Democrats hoping to expand their Senate map under the new Trump administration.",
      "Democrats have long seen Texas as tantalizing but elusive political ground. Cruz's 2018 and 2024 re-election campaigns ranked among the most expensive Senate contests in the country, with each race drawing more than $100 million in contributions. Cruz ultimately edged out former Rep. Beto O'Rourke by 2.6 points in 2018 and defeated Allred by 8.5 points in 2024.",
      "Cornyn, by contrast, has enjoyed more comfortable margins. He defeated Democrat MJ Hegar by 9.6 points in 2020 and won re-election in 2014 by a commanding 27.2-point spread over Democrat David Alameel.",
      "Still, some Texas Democrats see signs of momentum and believe the political environment in 2026 could finally break their way \u2014 especially if Paxton, who is leading in early primary polls, manages to unseat Cornyn. Cornyn has tried to capitalize on the risk, warning that a Paxton nomination \"would be catastrophic.\"",
      "Paxton was impeached by the Texas House in 2023 on bribery allegations but was acquitted by the state Senate. He was also previously under federal investigation for corruption, though the Justice Department declined to pursue charges near the end of the Biden administration.",
      "In his campaign launch video, Allred took aim at both of his potential Republican opponents.",
      "\"I'm announcing my candidacy for the United States Senate to lower costs and stop corrupt politicians like John Cornyn and Ken Paxton from rigging the economy against hard-working Texans,\" he says.",
      "The Democratic field could become crowded. O'Rourke and Rep. Joaquin Castro of San Antonio \u2014 an outspoken critic of the Trump administration's immigration policies \u2014 are both\u00a0 considering bids. Retired astronaut Terry Virts officially entered the race last week, and other potential contenders include progressive state Rep. James Talarico, a rising star on social media with nearly 900,000 TikTok followers.",
      "Still, the road for Democrats remains challenging. The party hasn't won a statewide race in Texas since 1994, hasn't elected anyone to the U.S. Senate from Texas since 1988 and last carried the state in a presidential election in 1976.",
      "Democratic hopes have largely rested on the continued erosion of GOP margins in the suburbs around Dallas and Houston. While that suburban trend has persisted since 2018, Republicans have made gains elsewhere \u2014 particularly in the historically Democratic-leaning Rio Grande Valley, where Hispanic voters have shifted rightward in recent cycles.",
      "Democrats are aiming to retake control of Congress in 2026, and while the House appears within reach, the Senate map is a tough climb. The party is defending key seats in swing states like Georgia and Michigan and will need to expand the map in red or purple territory to have a shot at the majority.",
      "Beyond Texas, Democrats are also eyeing a potential opening in Maine, where Republican Sen. Susan Collins has not confirmed her re-election plans. And in North Carolina, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis' stunning decision not to seek another term will likely make the race even more competitive in the Tar Heel State, a persistent battleground.",

      "In a separate post, Musk said he will support Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill when it passed the House, leading Mr. Trump to back a primary challenge.",
      "Musk also suggested starting \"a new political party that actually cares about the people\" on Monday, an idea he first floated earlier this month. He said if the bill passes, a new political party \u2014 which he calls the \"America Party\" \u2014 \"will be formed the next day.\"",
      "Musk's latest swipes came as the Senate worked to advance the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, holding a marathon series of amendment votes on Monday. The Senate still needs to vote on final passage, and the House will need to approve the Senate's changes, before a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the bill to Mr. Trump's desk.",
      "It's unclear how serious Musk is about the apparent threat to back primary challenges against supporters of the legislation \u2014 or what support, if any, he could offer to challengers. But it suggests Musk could remain involved in politics, after spending upwards of $250 million to help elect Mr. Trump and other Republicans last year. The Tesla CEO indicated last month he planned to dial back his political spending for now, saying, \"I think I've done enough.\"",
      "The vast majority of House and Senate Republicans have backed the bill, though some lawmakers have withheld their support, objecting to its Medicaid cuts or arguing it doesn't go far enough to slash spending. Mr. Trump has applied intense pressure to Republicans and lashed out at the remaining holdouts: In a statement last weekend, the White House said \"failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "Musk has railed against the legislation on and off for weeks. The billionaire blasted the bill in early June, calling it a \"disgusting abomination\" \u2014 igniting a dayslong feud between President Trump and the world's richest man that seemed to signal the end of a once close partnership.",
      "The billionaire, who once led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, backed down in mid-June and acknowledged some of his attacks on Mr. Trump \"went too far.\" He remained fairly quiet about the legislation for weeks, but his criticism has intensified in recent days, as lawmakers rush to finalize the bill by the end of the week.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0lashed out at Musk in an early Tuesday morning Truth Social post that noted Tesla has benefitted from federal electric vehicle tax credits \u2014 a program the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would phase out. The president also suggested DOGE should \"take a good, hard, look at\" other subsidies Musk has benefitted from.",
      "\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Musk responded to Mr. Trump's message: \"I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now.\"",
      "Why is Musk opposed to Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\"?",
      "Many of Musk's criticisms zero in on the bill's price tag, calling its spending levels \"insane\" and attacking a provision in the Senate version of the bill that hikes the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.",
      "But the billionaire has also panned the bill's cuts to green energy tax credits and excise tax on certain renewable energy projects, calling those provisions \"utter madness\" that could \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country.\"",
      "Those provisions could directly impact Musk's electric carmaker, Tesla. The phaseout of electric vehicle tax credits may cost the company $1.2 billion, an analysis by JPMorgan Chase estimated. Tesla's solar power and energy storage businesses also benefit from government incentives, and ending those programs \"may harm our business\" by \"making our products less competitive for customers,\" the company disclosed in an annual report filed earlier this year.",

      "Abrego Garcia was indicted by a federal grand jury on two charges of human smuggling in late May, after which the government returned him to the U.S. to face federal prosecution. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "His return came weeks after a federal judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court. A U.S. immigration official had acknowledged Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador was an administrative error, as he had been granted a legal status in 2019 that prevented the Department of Homeland Security from removing Abrego Garcia to his home country because of likely persecution by local gangs.",
      "After Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. to face the human smuggling offenses, the Justice Department requested he remain detained while awaiting trial. But Holmes earlier this month rejected that request and said he should be granted pretrial release.",
      "The Justice Department appealed that decision, and a U.S. district judge set a hearing for July 16 on the request to revoke Holmes' release order.",
      "But during a hearing last week to review the conditions of Abrego Garcia's release, lawyers for the Salvadoran man and the Justice Department acknowledged that he would likely be detained by the Department of Homeland Security and deported swiftly after being released from Justice Department custody, which would interfere with his criminal proceeding.",
      "Holmes put off issuing her order of release, and Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked her to delay it further because of what they said are conflicting statements about whether he would be removed to a third country \u2014 one other than El Salvador \u2014 if detained by immigration authorities while awaiting trial.",
      "Federal prosecutors did not oppose the request.",
      "\"A short delay will prevent the government from removing Mr. Abrego and allow time for the government to provide reliable information concerning its intentions,\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers wrote in a filing to Holmes.",
      "The magistrate judge agreed to the request and said Abrego Garcia will remain in the custody of U.S. Marshals to allow for the July 16 hearing and a decision on the government's bid to revoke his release order.",

      "After the Senate parliamentarian ruled that Lee's original proposal, which encompassed millions of acres, would violate budget reconciliation rules, he had reduced the acreage. The bill, which contains President Trump's tax cuts, border and defense initiatives, is being considered under the special rules because it requires only a simple majority to pass, rather than the 60-vote super majority that is required for consideration of most legislation in the Senate.",
      "Under Lee's plan, land in 11 Western states from Alaska to New Mexico would have been eligible for sale. Montana was carved out of the proposal after its lawmakers objected. In states like Utah and Nevada, the government controls the vast majority of lands, protecting them from potential exploitation but hindering growth.",
      "Lee's revised plan would have excluded all U.S. Forest Service land from possible sale. Sales of sites controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management were to be significantly reduced, Lee said, so that only land within 5 miles of population centers could be sold.",
      "But in addition to opposition from Democrats, Republican senators in Idaho and Montana objected to the plan, too. Several House Republicans also said that if the provision were included in the Senate bill, they would vote against it when the bill received a vote in the lower chamber, threatening its passage.",
      "Lee said in his statement that he still believes the federal government \"owns far too much land\u2014land it is mismanaging and in many cases ruining for the next generation\" and he complained that under Democratic presidents, \"massive swaths of the West are being locked away from the people who live there, with no meaningful recourse.\"",
      "The House originally had a public land sales provision, too, one which would have allowed sales of acreage in Utah and Nevada. But GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana, who served as interior secretary during President Trump's first administration, opposed the idea immediately.",
      "\"I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands,\" Zinke said in a statement in May. \"Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn't creating more land.\"",
      "Several other Western state Republican House members also rejected the idea, so the provision was stripped out of the budget bill before the House voted on it.",
      "Housing advocates have cautioned that federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing. Some of the parcels up for sale in Utah and Nevada under the House proposal were many miles from developed areas.",
      "New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee, said before Lee withdrew his plan that it would exclude Americans from places where they fish, hunt and camp.",
      "\"I don't think it's clear that we would even get substantial housing as a result of this,\" Heinrich said earlier this month. \"What I know would happen is people would lose access to places they know and care about and that drive our Western economies.\"",

      "The event is also expected to feature a flyover by B-2 Spirit bombers, the jets that were used to strike Iran's uranium enrichment sites at Fordo and Natanz earlier this month in an operation ordered by President Trump.",
      "Additional personnel from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri \u2014 where the bombers are based \u2014 will also attend the event, which is expected to feature remarks from Mr. Trump.",

      "The Pentagon said seven B-2 bombers participated in the strikes on Fordo and Natanz, flying continually for the entire 36-hour round trip from Missouri to Iran and back \u2014 requiring multiple mid-air refuelings and assistance from fighter jets.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed an executive order Monday afternoon terminating the United States' sanctions program on Syria, the White House announced.",
      "The executive order comes after Mr. Trump announced in May during a trip to the Middle East that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on the country. While in the Middle East, Mr. Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who announced a transitional government in March. The Assad regime\u00a0collapsed under the weight of an offensive by opposition forces. Sanctions will remain on Bashar al-Assad, Syria's former president.",
      "\"The order will remove sanctions on Syria while maintaining sanctions on the former president, Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, persons linked to chemical weapons activities, ISIS and their affiliates, and Iranian proxies,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday.",
      "Syria's transitional government has been pushing the Trump administration for sanctions relief for months, and some work has been underway to ease some sanctions since before the president's May announcement.",
      "Some sanctions would still need to be formally revoked by Congress. Syria has been under U.S. sanctions in some form since 1979, when the country was designated a state sponsor of terrorism.",
      "Last month, the Treasury Department issued formal guidance rolling back some sanctions on banks, airlines and al-Shaara. It also released guidelines for approved transactions in Syria, including infrastructure projects. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at the time that the measures were designed to encourage investment in Syria.",
      "\"As President Trump promised, the Treasury Department and the State Department are implementing authorizations to encourage new investment into Syria,\" Bessent said. \"Syria must also continue to work towards becoming a stable country that is at peace, and today's actions will hopefully put the country on a path to a bright, prosperous, and stable future.\"",
      "The new transitional government has blamed sanctions \u2014 which include penalties on third countries for doing business in Syria \u2014 for the country's inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct sizable chunks of war-ravaged cities and rebuild a health care system decimated by war.",
      "Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two U.S. allies in the region, have backed normalizing relations with Syria's new government. Both countries have provided aid to Syria, and Saudi Arabia has offered to pay off some of the country's debts, two activities that could run afoul of sanctions. The Saudis see an opportunity to win the new Syrian government over to their side, after decades of the country being allied with their top regional rival, Iran, while the Assad regime was in power.",
      "Relief was a key topic in meetings between Syrian officials, including its Central Bank Governor Abdelkadir Husrieh, and other world leaders at the IMF and World Bank spring meetings last month in Washington.",
      "Some of the most punitive measures were imposed over the last two decades on the Assad regime for human rights abuses and support for groups designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations. The Assad government collapsed in December as rebel groups, including fighters led by Sharaa, swept into Damascus, ending a 13-year-long civil war.",
      "In 2003, then-President George W. Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act into law, which centered on Syria's support for U.S.-designated terror groups like Hezbollah, Syria's military presence in Lebanon, as well as alleged development of weapons of mass destruction, oil smuggling and backing of armed groups in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/organizing-summer-democrats/",
    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:23:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Democrats found themselves locked out of power in Washington after the 2024 presidential election. Now campaign groups are readying an effort to help the party regain power.",
    "story": [
      "An alliance of leading national Democratic groups is preparing a new effort this summer focused on driving voter engagement as the party tries to regain support following its defeats in 2024.",
      "The plans, first obtained by CBS News, fall under the label of what these groups have dubbed \"Organizing Summer.\" While this year has relatively few major statewide elections,\u00a0 such as gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, the 2026 midterms will be a crucial test for a party that is trying to respond to the lessons learned from Republicans' wins in last year's campaigns, including the presidential race. The groups behind the summer organizing effort include the Democratic National Committee, the Democrats' coalition of state parties as well as the campaign arms for House, Senate and gubernatorial contests.",
      "The DNC alone intends to initially invest a six-figure dollar amount in the wide-ranging effort, with plans to scale to seven figures as the summer goes on.",
      "\"For too long, the DNC has been a D.C. institution, and we're trying to get the DNC out of DC and into the states through this program,\" a Democratic strategist familiar with the plans said.",
      "The summer program is focused on voter engagement and registration, particularly with voters who wouldn't otherwise hear Democrats' messaging. The DNC has signed up 16,000 volunteers, twice as many as it typically has in an off-election year, according to a Democratic strategist familiar with the plans. As part of the summer effort, Democrats will urge volunteers to connect with voters in less politically dominated parts of life, with the outline of the plan pointing to community groups, book clubs and social media platforms as examples.",
      "The plans include developing a \"direct pathway to share feedback they receive from voters, and what they are seeing online, helping the party inform its messaging and strategy on an ongoing basis,\" according to upcoming details about the party's work shared by the strategist familiar with the program.",
      "\"We are deploying an army of thousands of volunteers to activate their communities, register voters, and make sure the Republicans who are putting billionaires ahead of working and middle class Americans lose their elections in 2025 and lose their seats in the midterms,\" DNC chairman Ken Martin said in a statement.",
      "National Democrats are also keen on trying to build momentum after party infighting spilled out into the open during the early months of Martin's tenure leading the DNC.",
      "An April announcement from activist David Hogg and his political organization, Leaders We Deserve,\u00a0 detailing plans to \"start primarying out-of-touch, ineffective House Democrats in solid blue seats\" caused a rift with Martin and other party leaders. This eventually led to Hogg losing his position as a DNC vice chair. Soon after that standoff ended, attention grew around\u00a0two leaders from major labor unions exiting the DNC, bringing about more questions about the direction of the party moving forward.",
      "Many Democrats have been uneasy about the infighting, wanting to focus instead on trying to win elections in the coming months and years.",
      "In an attempt to help do that, Democrats' summer initiative includes all\u00a035 of the GOP districts\u00a0the House Democrats' campaign arm is focusing on at this stage, U.S. Senate races in North Carolina and Maine and the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, according to the Democratic strategist familiar with the plans.",
      "Democrats are already attempting to use President Trump's wide-ranging \"big, beautiful bill\" making its way through Congress as a flashpoint in the midterms, and that work will also be a major point of the summer organizing program.",
      "The GOP House version of the legislation, which narrowly passed the chamber,\u00a0continues\u00a0major parts of Mr. Trump's first term Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Yet it also includes more politically volatile changes, such as enforcing Medicaid work requirements and changes to federal food assistance. Senate Republicans have been working to try and pass their own version of the bill as well. As the process plays out, national Republicans already appear to be centering a major part of the GOP's chances in the 2026 midterms on Mr. Trump's agenda legislation.",
      "\"The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes common-sense policies supported by a majority of Americans,\" House GOP campaign arm chairman Richard Hudson\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media recently. \"@HouseGOP Republicans are putting Americans first while Democrats defend the waste, fraud, abuse, and illegal aliens.\"",
      "Last year's elections sent Republicans to Washington with unified control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, giving them clear paths to act on Mr. Trump's agenda. Democrats are facing a difficult map to try and reclaim the Senate in 2026, meaning that the left's best hopes at gaining power back in Washington are likely centered on winning back the House next year. Since Mr. Trump's second inauguration, Democratic governors have proven to be a major counter to his actions, meaning that either maintaining or winning governor's offices around the country is a critical goal for the party as well. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, for instance, sued Trump and others earlier this month over the\u00a0federal deployment\u00a0of state National Guard members following immigration protests.",
      "Whether efforts like the summer organizing will be enough to help the party move forward is likely to be closely watched among politicians and operatives looking to build campaigns not just for the 2026 midterms, but the 2028 presidential election cycle as well.",
      "\"Our job this summer is to make sure working families know exactly who is responsible for taking food off their table and ripping away their health care,\" Martin said in his statement.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:08:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP Senate version of the \"big, beautiful bill\" would raise the cost of wind and solar projects by 10% to 20%, one energy group estimated.",
    "story": [
      "The latest version of the bill containing President Trump's second term agenda would hobble the renewable energy industry with a new excise tax, in addition to speeding up the sunsetting of tax credits and other benefits.",
      "The additional tax on wind and solar projects, which appeared on page 558 in the version of the bill released over the weekend, is estimated to increase consumer energy prices 8% to 10% and would tax clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an\u00a0analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax would apply to all projects that go into construction after June 16 through 2036, and it would also apply to projects that are placed into service after 2027, even if they already are under construction.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Politico Monday that she planned to introduce an amendment that would tie eligibility for the wind and solar tax credits to a project's construction start date, rather than its service date. The Senate is currently holding a marathon vote series on\u00a0proposed amendments to the bill.",
      "These wind and solar projects would have to pay the tax if a certain percentage of the value of their materials are sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. The provision is ostensibly designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components would be cost prohibitive, and some data and AI companies \u2014 which require prodigious amounts of energy \u2014 could turn to China or other countries for reliable and affordable power sources, according to clean power experts.",
      "The Senate bill also scales back or eliminates renewable energy tax breaks that have been in place since 2005 and revised and expanded a few times since then, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The most recent expansion contained tax breaks for individuals for electric vehicles, wind and solar development, and energy efficient appliances and provided tax credits for clean electricity-generating projects that went into service from 2023 through the end of 2032.",
      "Both the Senate and the House would end the renewable energy tax credits, but the Senate would accelerate the timeline in the House version, which would end the tax credits for renewable energy projects placed in service after 2028, a year later than the Senate would.",
      "Eliminating the existing tax credits would likely kill up to 72% of the new wind and solar installations that were to be completed in the U.S. over the next decade, according to analysis from Rhodium Group, a research firm.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who until Saturday was silent on the bill after his social media spat with President Trump over the House version, said of the Senate bill that it was \"Utterly insane and destructive.\"",
      "\"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,\" he said in a post on X. And he predicted it would \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\" Musk also said, \"A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.\"",
      "According to Politico, President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to further \"crack down\" on wind and solar energy by phasing out clean energy credits faster, rather than sunsetting the tax incentives more slowly, which moderate senators favored. Some asked for help easing the hit their states would take as a result of cancelled projects, job losses and higher energy prices.",
      "The renewable energy industry, manufacturing unions and even some conservatives also criticized the new tax.",
      "Conservative energy expert Alex Epstein, advocates ending the green tax credits, but he appeared to be taken by surprise by the excise tax, saying in a post on X, \"I just learned about the excise tax and it's definitely not something I would support.\"",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also quickly condemned the tax.",
      "Neil Bradly, the Chamber's executive vice president, said on social media, \"taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables.\u00a0 Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.\"",
      "The North American Building Trades Union, in a statement, called the bill potentially \"the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.\"",
      "\"Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,\" the statement continued. \"In some cases, it worsens the already harmful trajectory of the House-passed language, threatening an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs and over 3 billion work hours, which translates to $148 billion in lost annual wages and benefits.\"",

    "story": [
      "Detentions of immigrants without criminal histories have risen sharply since May amid a broader push to expand immigration enforcement, according to a CBS News analysis of data from the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "White House adviser Stephen Miller announced a push for a new, higher target of 3,000 arrests daily in late May. From the first week of May to the first week of June, new ICE detentions of people facing only civil immigration charges, such as entering the country without authorization, rose by over 250%.",
      "President Trump has repeatedly said his administration is focusing deportation efforts on criminals. Until recently, federal agents working to enforce his orders have detained more immigrants with criminal convictions or pending criminal charges than those without them each week, the data shows.",
      "But even among those with criminal convictions \u2014 about 40% of detainees since Jan. 20 \u2014 the majority were not for violent offenses. Overall, roughly 8% of all detainees had been convicted of violent crimes, CBS News found.",
      "\"What we're doing is we're really going after the criminal aliens, of which we have plenty to work with,\" Mr. Trump said at an event promoting his legislative package on Thursday. At a White House news conference with the president Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi was asked about enforcement and said, \"The violent criminals in our country are the priority now.\"",
      "However, top White House officials, including \"border czar\" Tom Homan, have also said anyone who entered the country illegally could face removal.",
      "Homan told CBS News in May that while ICE would prioritize public safety and national security threats, \"If you're in the country illegally, you're not off the table,\" adding, \"It's a violation of law to enter this country illegally.\"",
      "More than 97,000 people have been detained over Mr. Trump's first five months in office, CBS News' analysis found, while ICE arrests, which do not always result in detentions, topped 100,000 earlier this month.",
      "A record 59,000 people were currently being held in ICE detention as of June 23 \u2014 nearly half of them with no criminal record, CBS News reported last week.",
      "The data CBS News analyzed for this report comes from ICE and was released to the Deportation Data Project, a group of academics and lawyers who collect and publish immigration data. The group sued to obtain the data after filing a Freedom of Information Act request.",
      "ICE did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Since the first week of June, the number detained with only civil immigration charges was double that of individuals with criminal convictions. This represents an abrupt reversal from the first four months of Mr. Trump's second term, when the number of immigration detainees with a criminal record outnumbered those detained on civil immigration charges.",
      "The new target of 3,000 daily arrests announced by Miller is a sharp increase from the the 660 daily arrests made on average during Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office.",
      "Out of the more than 97,700 people ICE has detained since Mr. Trump took office, more than 39,500, or about 40%, had criminal convictions. Of those, nearly 23,000 were removed as of mid-June.",
      "Among those with criminal convictions, about 8,200 \u2014 8.4% \u2014 had convictions for violent crimes, including 478 convicted of homicide and about 6,800 convicted of assault or sexual assault. Violent offenses, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, include crimes that are \"threatening, attempting, or actually using physical force against a person.\"",
      "Additionally, about 5,000 had drug-related convictions.",
      "Traffic-related offenses made up the largest category of crimes among those with prior convictions, with driving under the influence of alcohol the single most common violation.",
      "In an interview with CBS News's Major Garrett in May, Homan blamed \"sanctuary city\" policies for leading to more arrests of those without criminal convictions.",
      "\"When sanctuary cities force us into the neighborhood to find that bad guy, many times that person is with others that are illegally in the country but may not be a criminal target,\" he said. \"Well, they're going to go too.\"",
      "Homan has called these \"collateral arrests.\"",
      "People without criminal convictions are also easier targets for removal, said Ariel Ruiz Soto, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. That's because they tend to be easier to find and more concentrated in one place, he added.",
      "\"It requires significantly more resources to go after one person who may be armed and dangerous as opposed to going outside a Home Depot and trying to gather a larger number of people,\" he told CBS News.",
      "A CBS News poll completed in early June indicates that mass deportation of non-criminals is unpopular among Americans. The poll found that Americans who believe Mr. Trump's deportation efforts are focused on dangerous criminals support those efforts. But among those who do not think criminals were the focus, support dropped dramatically.",
      "Heightened ICE activity has sparked protests across the country in recent weeks, especially in Los Angeles, where Mr. Trump called in the National Guard in response.",
      "California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom accused the administration of \"indiscriminately targeting hardworking immigrant families, regardless of their roots or risk.\"",
      "Some Republican elected officials have also expressed concern. Six GOP members of Congress wrote a letter to ICE acting director Todd Lyons requesting that ICE reveal how many convicted criminals have been deported since January.",
      "\"Every minute that we spend pursuing an individual with a clean record is a minute less that we dedicate to apprehending terrorists or cartel operatives,\" they wrote.",
      "Ruiz Soto, of the Migration Policy Institute, told CBS News that based on Homan's statements on immigration enforcement, he isn't surprised that detentions are predominantly non-criminals.",
      "\"There's been a disconnect from the beginning about the rhetoric from President Trump that seems to emphasize a focus on violent and the 'worst of the worst' criminals compared to what his cabinet and DHS has been saying from Day One,\" he said. \"When you look at the numbers it's very clear that has not been the case since the beginning.\"",

      "\"Harvard's commitment to racial hierarchies \u2014 where individuals are sorted and judged according to their membership in an oppressed group identity and not individual merit \u2014 has enabled anti-Semitism to fester on Harvard's campus and has led a once great institution to humiliation, offering remedial math and forcing Jewish students to hide their identities and ancestral stories,\" the administration officials, which make up the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, wrote.",
      "They warned that a failure to \"institute adequate changes immediately\" would lead to a loss of federal financial resources to Harvard and \"continue to affect\" the university's relationship with the federal government.",
      "Harvard said in response to the investigation's conclusion that it has made \"significant strides to combat bigotry, hate and bias\" and is committed to \"ensuring members of our Jewish and Israeli community are embraced, respected, and can thrive at Harvard.\"",
      "\"Antisemitism is a serious problem and no matter the context, it is unacceptable. Harvard has taken substantive, proactive steps to address the root causes of antisemitism in its community,\" the university said in a statement. \"In responding to the government's investigation, Harvard not only shared its comprehensive and retrospective Antisemitism and Anti-Israeli Bias Report but also outlined the ways that it has strengthened policies, disciplined those who violate them, encouraged civil discourse, and promoted open, respectful dialogue. Harvard is far from indifferent on this issue and strongly disagrees with the government's findings.\"",
      "The Trump administration has been engaged in an ongoing battle with Harvard and mounted efforts to punish the school on multiple fronts. Agencies have frozen billions of dollars in grants and contracts to the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based university and revoked its ability to enroll foreign students. Harvard has sued the administration over its efforts, and a federal judge temporarily blocked the moves related to international students. President Trump has also threatened to revoke\u00a0Harvard's tax-exempt status, and the university is facing numerous investigations from across the federal government.",
      "Many of the sanctions stem from what administration officials have said is the school's failure to condemn antisemitism and protect Jewish students on campus. But the Trump administration has also taken aim at Harvard's hiring and admissions practices, and in April, it made a series of 10 demands in a letter to university leadership. Among the changes government officials said Harvard needs to undertake are a discontinuation of its diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs and policies; implementation of merit-based admissions and hiring policies; and disclosure of all foreign funding sources.",
      "Harvard bucked the administration's demands, which its president, Alan Garber, said exceed the power of the federal government.",
      "In its latest letter to Garber related to the civil rights investigation, led by the Office for Civil Rights at the United States Department of Health and Human Services, federal officials accused Harvard of \"being among the most prominent and visible breeding ground for race discrimination.\" They cited the Supreme Court's June 2023 ruling that ended affirmative action programs in higher education, which arose from a challenge to Harvard's policies.",
      "\"Any institution that refuses to meet its duties under federal law may not receive a wide range of federal privileges,\" they said.",
      "The letter is signed by Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for civil rights; Sean Keveney, acting general counsel of the Department of Health and Human Services; Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner for Federal Acquisition Service at the General Services Administration; and Thomas Wheeler, acting general counsel at the Department of Education.",
      "The officials said its investigation found that a quarter of Jewish students felt physically unsafe on the Ivy League campus, and Jewish and Israeli students were assaulted and spit on. They also cited a pro-Palestinian encampment set up on Harvard Yard last year that \"instilled fear in, and disrupted the studies of, Jewish and Israeli students.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it found that \"Harvard has been in some cases deliberately indifferent, and in others has been a willful participant in anti-Semitic harassment of Jewish students, faculty, and staff.\"",
      "Amid the ongoing fight with Harvard, Mr. Trump\u00a0hinted earlier this month that his administration had been in talks with the university, writing on social media that it was \"very possible that a Deal will be announced over the next week or so.\"",
      "\"They have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,\" the president wrote. \"If a Settlement is made on the basis that is currently being discussed, it will be 'mindbogglingly' HISTORIC, and very good for our Country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not provide any further details about the possible settlement or what it would resolve.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hhs-cdc-staff-birth-control-safety-women-at-risk/",
    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration eliminated the CDC team that developed national guidelines for prescribing contraception safely for millions of women with underlying medical conditions.",
    "story": [
      "For Brianna Henderson, birth control isn't just about preventing pregnancy.",
      "The Texas mother of two was diagnosed with a rare and potentially fatal heart condition after having her second child. In addition to avoiding another pregnancy that could be life-threatening, Henderson has to make sure the contraception she uses doesn't jeopardize her health.",
      "For more than a decade, a small team of people at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention worked to do just that, issuing national guidelines for clinicians on how to prescribe contraception safely for millions of women with underlying medical conditions \u2014 including heart disease, lupus, sickle cell disease, and obesity. But the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, fired those workers as part of the Trump administration's rapid downsizing of the federal workforce.",
      "It also decimated the CDC's larger Division of Reproductive Health, where the team was housed \u2014 a move that clinicians, advocacy groups, and fired workers say will endanger the health of women and their babies.",
      "Clinicians said in interviews that counseling patients about birth control and prescribing it is relatively straightforward. But for women with conditions that put them at higher risk of serious health complications, special care is needed.",
      "\"We really were the only source of safety monitoring in this country,\" said one fired CDC staffer who worked on the guidelines, known as the U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, or MEC. \"There's no one who can actually do this work.\" KFF Health News agreed not to name this worker and others who were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation.",
      "The stakes are high for people like Henderson. About six weeks after having her second baby, she said, her heart \"was racing.\"",
      "\"I feel like I'm underwater,\" Henderson said. \"I felt like I couldn't breathe.\" She eventually went to the hospital, where she was told she was \"in full-blown heart failure,\" she said.",
      "Henderson was diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy, an uncommon type of heart failure that can happen toward the end of pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. Risk factors for the condition include being at least 30 years old, being of African descent, high blood pressure, and obesity.",
      "The CDC contraception guidelines say that combined hormonal contraception, which contains both estrogen and progestin to prevent pregnancy, can pose an \"unacceptable health risk\" for most women with peripartum cardiomyopathy, also known as PPCM. For some women with the diagnosis, a birth control injection commonly known by the brand name Depo-Provera also carries risks that outweigh its benefits, the guidelines show. Progestin-only pills or a birth control implant, inserted into a person's arm, are the safest.",
      "Henderson said her cardiologist had to greenlight which contraception she could use. She uses a progestin-only birth control implant that's more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy.",
      "\"I didn't know that certain things can cause blood clots,\" Henderson said, \"or make your heart failure worse.\" Heart failure is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in the U.S., with PPCM accounting for up to 70% of heart failure cases during pregnancy.",
      "Sweeping HHS layoffs in late March and early April gutted the CDC's reproductive health division, upending several programs designed to protect women and infants, three fired workers said.",
      "About two-thirds of the division's roughly 165 employees and contractors were cut, through firings, retirements, or reassignments to other parts of the agency, one worker said.",
      "Among those fired were CDC staffers who carried out the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, a survey established nearly 40 years ago to improve maternal and infant health outcomes by asking detailed questions of women who recently gave birth. The survey was used \"to help inform and help reduce the contributing factors that cause maternal mortality and morbidity,\" one fired worker said, by allowing government workers to examine the medical care people received before and during pregnancy, if any, and other risk factors that may lead to poor maternal and child health.",
      "The firings also removed CDC workers who collected and analyzed data on in vitro fertilization and other fertility treatments.",
      "\"They left nothing behind,\" one worker said.",
      "U.S. contraception guidelines were first published in 2010, after the CDC adapted guidance developed by the World Health Organization. The latest version was published in August 2024. It includes information about the safety of different types of contraception for more than 60 medical conditions. Clinicians said it is the premier source of evidence about the safety of birth control.",
      "\"It gave us so much information which was not available to clinicians at their fingertips,\" said Michael Policar, a physician and professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California-San Francisco School of Medicine.",
      "\"If you've got a person with, let's say, long-standing Type 2 diabetes, someone who has a connective-tissue disease like lupus, someone who's got hypertension or maybe has been treated for a precursor to breast cancer \u2014 something like that? In those circumstances,\" Policar said, \"before the MEC it was really hard to know how to manage those people.\"",
      "The CDC updates the guidelines comprehensively roughly every five years. On a weekly basis, however, government workers would monitor evidence about patients' use of contraception and the safety of various methods, something they were doing when HHS abruptly fired them this spring, two fired workers said. That work isn't happening now, one of them said.",
      "Sometimes the agency would issue interim changes outside the larger updates if new evidence warranted it. Now, if something new or urgent comes up, \"there's not going to be any way to update the guidelines,\" one fired worker said.",
      "In 2020, for example, the CDC revised its contraception recommendations for women at high risk of HIV infection, after new evidence showed that various methods were safer than previously thought.",
      "HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard declined to say why CDC personnel working on the contraception guidelines and other reproductive health issues were fired, or answer other questions raised by KFF Health News' reporting.",
      "Most women of reproductive age in the U.S. use contraception. CDC data from 2019, the most recent available, shows that more than 47 million women ages 15 to 49 relied on birth control. About 1 in 10 used long-acting methods such as intrauterine devices and implants; 1 in 7 used oral contraception.",
      "The latest guidelines included updated safety recommendations for women who have sickle cell disease, lupus, or PPCM, and those who are breastfeeding, among others. Clinicians are now being told that combined hormonal contraception poses an unacceptable health risk for women with sickle cell disease, because it might increase the risk of blood clots.",
      "\"It can really come down to life or death,\" said Teonna Woolford, CEO of the Sickle Cell Reproductive Health Education Directive, a nonprofit that advocates for improved reproductive health care for people with the disease.",
      "\"We really saw the CDC guidelines as a win, as a victory \u2014 they're actually going to pay attention,\" she said.",
      "The 2024 guidelines also for the first time included birth control recommendations for women with chronic kidney disease. Research has shown that such women are at higher risk of serious pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia and preterm delivery. Their medical condition also increases their risk of blood clots, which is why it's important for them to not use combined hormonal contraception, fired CDC workers and clinicians said.",
      "The CDC information \"is the final say in safety,\" said Patty Cason, a family nurse practitioner and president of Envision Sexual and Reproductive Health. Having only static information about the safety of various types of birth control is \"very scary,\" she said, because new evidence could come out and entirely new methods of contraception are being developed.",
      "Henderson said it took her heart two years to recover. She created the nonprofit organization Let's Talk PPCM to educate women about the type of heart failure she was diagnosed with, including what forms of birth control are safe.",
      "\"We don't want blood clots, worsening heart failures,\" Henderson said. \"They already feel like they can't trust their doctors, and we don't need extra.\"",

    "summary": "Researchers said their findings suggest husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage \u2013 suggesting a female dominance.",
    "story": [
      "An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a \"matriarchal society\" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published\u00a0in Science this week.",
      "Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a \"Mother Goddess\" cult and signs of a matriarchal society.",
      "A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building.",
      "During the early years in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said.",
      "Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males.",
      "\"We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line \u2014 a matrilineal system,\" study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and\u00a0found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the\u00a0journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said upon the release of their findings, \"It is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

      "Dispute apparently settled",
      "Work from two decades ago suggested the rocks could be 4.3 billion years old, placing them in the earliest period of Earth's history. But other scientists using a different dating method contested the finding, arguing that long-ago contaminants were skewing the rocks' age and that they were actually slightly younger \u2014 at 3.8 billion years old.",
      "In the new study, researchers sampled a different section of rock from the belt and estimated its age using the previous two dating techniques - measuring how one radioactive element decays into another over time. The result: The rocks were about 4.16 billion years old.",
      "The different methods \"gave exactly the same age,\" said study author Jonathan O'Neil with the University of Ottawa.",
      "The new research was published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Ancient rocks could shed light on Earth's earliest days",
      "Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of dust and gas soon after the solar system existed. Primordial rocks often get melted and recycled by Earth's moving tectonic plates, making them extremely rare on the surface today. Scientists have uncovered 4 billion-year-old rocks from another formation in Canada called the Acasta Gneiss Complex, but the Nuvvuagittuq rocks could be even older.",

      "The New Shepard capsule's stubby single-stage booster roared to life just after 9:38 a.m. EDT, throttled up to full thrust and smoothly climbed away from Blue Origin's launch site near Van Horn, Texas.",
      "Liftoff came eight days later than originally planned due to high winds in the West Texas desert, but the weather met Blue Origin's safety requirements on Sunday.",
      "The hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine powering the New Shepard fired for about two-and-a-half minutes, accelerating the spacecraft to just under three times the speed of sound. The capsule then separated from the booster and continued coasting upward along its up-and-down trajectory.",
      "At that point, the passengers \u2013 Allie and Carl Kuehner, Leland Larson, Freddie Rescigno Jr., Jim Sitkin and Owolabi Salis, the first Nigerian to fly in space \u2013 began enjoying about three minutes of weightlessness.",
      "Free to unstrap and float about the cabin, the passengers were able to take in the view through the largest windows in any operational spacecraft as the ship climbed to an altitude of just above 65 miles. That's about three miles higher than the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The capsule then began falling back to Earth and the passengers returned to their seats for the descent to touchdown. The reusable booster, meanwhile, made its own return to the launch site, dropping tail first to a rocket-powered touchdown.",
      "Floating under three red-and-blue parachutes, the New Shepard capsule touched down a stone's throw from the booster's concrete landing pad, closer than any previous landing. Blue Origin said that it was the result of \"low winds ... and within the safety margins of our predicted models.\"",
      "Blue Origin has now launched 13 passenger flights since the sub-orbital spacecraft carried Amazon and Blue Origin founder Bezos and three others aloft in July 2021. The company has now launched 74 passengers, including Bezos' wife Lauren S\u00e1nchez, and four who have flown twice.",
      "Blue Origin and its passengers do not reveal how much it costs to fly aboard a New Shepard, but it's thought to be more than $500,000 per seat.",
      "The company has had the sub-orbital passenger market to itself since June 2024, when competitor Virgin Galactic, founded by entrepreneur Richard Branson, retired its original rocketplane to focus on building two upgraded Delta-class spacecraft. Virgin is expected to resume flights next year.",

Grace reminds us that spaceflight  is not just a feat of engineering,  but an act of goodwill to the  benefit of every human everywhere.\"",
      "Axiom Space provides \"private astronaut missions,\" or PAMs, to the International Space Station on a commercial basis. As the company's director of human spaceflight, Whitson, a retired astronaut with three NASA flights to her credit, is making her second flight for Axiom Space.",
      "It's not known what her crew's space agencies or governments paid for their flights, but Axiom passenger seats for space station visits typically sell for around $65 million to $70 million each. That covers the cost of nearly a year of NASA-sanctioned astronaut training, launch and a two-week stay aboard the station before returning to Earth with an ocean splashdown.",
      "The crew originally hoped to begin their mission on June 10, but the flight was held up by high winds offshore and then by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It was delayed again by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module.",
      "The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port.",
      "NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it, other than saying the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the closed-off PrK compartment to about 1.9 pounds per square inch.",
      "That presumably ensures the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station creates a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the PrK, isolating it from the rest of the station. But NASA has not confirmed the reason for the pressure change.",
      "Plans for the Ax-4 mission",
      "If all goes well, Crew Dragon Grace will catch up with the space station after a  28-hour rendezvous, moving in for docking at the space-facing port or  the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday.",

      "With a doctorate in biochemistry, Whitson, 65, retired from NASA in 2018 after three flights to the space station. Going into the Ax-4 flight, she had logged 675 days in space, including one post-retirement mission for Axiom Space.",

      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",

After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",

    "summary": "The Senate narrowly passed President Trump's massive tax and spending bill Tuesday after a marathon series of amendment votes.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate narrowly passed President Trump's massive tax and spending bill Tuesday after a marathon series of amendment votes that stretched more than 24 hours, delivering a major victory for the president and bringing the signature piece of legislation of his second term one step closer to his desk.",
      "The measure passed in a 51 to 50 vote, with all but three Republicans supporting the bill. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. GOP Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine joined all Democrats in voting against the bill.",
      "The vote came after the Senate worked through the weekend and into a scheduled recess to pass the bill, which now returns to the House for sign off. Mr. Trump has vowed to swiftly sign the measure, and pushed lawmakers to approve it by July 4.",
      "The legislation's passage also marks a significant victory for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who worked to sway GOP holdouts to back the legislation amid opposition on multiple fronts that threatened to thwart the bill's progress in recent days.",
      "\"This was an incredible victory for the American people,\" Thune said after the vote.",
      "Known by the GOP as the \"big, beautiful bill,\" the legislation includes ramped-up spending for border security, defense and energy production and extends trillions of dollars in tax cuts, partially offset by cuts to health care and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the legislation would increase federal deficits by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.",
      "While some Republicans had taken issue with the legislation's impact on the deficit, others cited concern with some of the steep cuts to Medicaid, which the CBO has said would leave nearly 12 million more Americans without health coverage over the coming years. And with a 53-seat majority, Senate GOP leaders could only afford to lose three Republican votes, with Vance as a tie-breaker. But those concerns were not enough to defeat the legislation, and last-minute changes secured the support of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, while apparently quelling other possible opponents to the bill.",
      "Mr. Trump welcomed news of the vote during a trip to Florida. \"There is something for everyone [in the bill], and I think it's going to go very nicely in the House,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Actually, I think it will be easier in the House than it was in the Senate.\"",
      "The path to passage",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, met with possible holdouts in his office as the vote series stretched late Monday and into the wee hours Tuesday. The majority leader met with fiscal hawks including Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rick Scott of Florida, and at another point in the night, he met with Paul, who had pledged to oppose the bill over a provision raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.",
      "Thune also talked briefly with Murkowski early Tuesday, since it appeared likely that her vote could make or break the bill in the Senate. The Alaska Republican had concerns about cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs and their impact on her state.",
      "Murkowski told reporters after the vote that her thought process on the bill was \"agonizing.\"",
      "\"I struggled mightily with the impact on the most vulnerable in this country,\" Murkowski said, citing the cuts to social safety net programs. But she outlined the unique conditions in her state, and the support Alaska received in the final version of the bill, saying \"I had to look on balance because people in my state are the ones that I put first.\"",
      "In a statement later in the afternoon, Murkowski said, \"My sincere hope is that this is not the final product.\"",
      "\"This bill needs more work across chambers and is not ready for the President's desk,\" she wrote. \"We need to work together to get this right.\"",
      "Senate Republicans advanced the legislation late Saturday, with all but two voting in favor following hours of delay as the GOP worked to iron out last-minute details and dispel concern among holdouts, including the fiscal hawks, Murkowski and Collins.",
      "Paul and Tillis were the two Republicans to oppose the bill's advancement Saturday, and they both voted against the legislation on final passage. With a handful of other possible opponents, Thune told reporters overnight that GOP leaders were working to determine what \"everybody has to have in terms of votes,\" a sign that the vote would come down to the wire.",
      "The Senate action comes after the House narrowly passed the bill last month. Senate Republicans worked to put their mark on the legislation, treading carefully so as not to throw off the delicate balance in the lower chamber.",
      "The House will need to approve the Senate's changes to the bill before it can head to the president's desk for his signature. And lawmakers are trying to move quickly, with a self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the measure signed. The House could return to Washington as early as Wednesday to begin consideration of the revised bill.",
      "Senate Republicans passed the legislation through the budget reconciliation process, which enables the party in the majority to move ahead without support from across the aisle. The Senate worked through the weekend as the GOP entered a final sprint on the legislation ahead of the July 4 deadline.",
      "Senate Democrats combatted the legislation in one of the only ways available to them: by delaying the process. Democrats forced the bill to be read in its entirety over the weekend, totaling nearly 16 hours, before using debate time to rail against the bill, and proposing amendments to put their GOP colleagues on the record on a number of controversial issues ahead of the midterm elections.",
      "On Monday, the Senate began what's known as a \"vote-a-rama,\" in which senators could offer an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to cast vote after vote. Democrats proposed a number of amendments to attempt to roll back some of the bill's more controversial provisions, to no avail. As the votes stretched overnight Monday and into Tuesday, senators voted on a handful of notable amendments, including a near-unanimous vote to eliminate language from the bill that would have put a pause on state regulations on artificial intelligence. The Senate also approved an amendment to move up Medicaid eligibility verification requirements preventing payments for people who are deceased.",
      "An amendment proposed by Collins that would have increased the rural hospital stabilization fund from $25 billion to $50 billion and imposed a higher tax rate on the wealthy to pay for the larger fund fell short. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters ahead of the vote that the amendment was like putting a \"band aid on an amputation \u2014 it doesn't fix the problem.\" The outcome made it less likely that Collins would ultimately support the bill, although the change was expected to be included in a wide-ranging amendment to the bill.",
      "During the marathon vote series, the Senate also addressed an outstanding disagreement over the current policy baseline, an accounting approach that would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing. Though Democrats railed against the move as the \"nuclear option,\" the chamber voted along party lines to affirm the use of the current policy baseline.",
      "Schumer lambasted the bill after the vote, criticizing Republicans for bowing to the president.",
      "\"The American people will remember the Republican betrayal,\" Schumer said.",
      "Cristina  Corujo, \n                                                  \n                                  Emily  Hung and \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Which cities have the best overall job market?",
      "Bend, Oregon, has the top job market in the United States, according to SmartAsset. The West Coast city notched points for its low unemployment rate (3.1%) and high income growth. From 2020 to 2023, the median income in Bend grew 44% \u2014 the fourth highest rate after Richmond, Virginia, (50%); Nampa, Idaho, (47%); and Dayton, Ohio, (45%).",

      "At the time of his arrest, Kohberger was a Ph.D. criminology student and teaching assistant at Washington State University's Pullman campus, which is about a 15-minute drive from Moscow, Idaho.",
      "Ben Mogan said he was relieved to get the letter about the plea deal.",
      "\"If you get a quick death sentence, then, you know, you don't have to spend decades thinking about how terrible you made the world,\" he said.",
      "\"We can actually put this behind us and not have these future dates and future things that we don't want to have to be at, that we shouldn't have to be at, that have to do with this terrible person,\" he said. \"We get to just think about the rest of our lives and have to try and figure out how to do it without Maddie and without the rest of the kids.\"",
      "The Goncalves family, however, said they \"are beyond furious at the State of Idaho\" in a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0shortly after the news broke. \"They have failed us. ... This was very unexpected,\" they wrote.",
      "The family said the Latah County Prosecutor's Office \"vaguely mentioned a possible plea on Friday, without seeking our input, and presented the plea on Sunday.\" The family has pushed for Kohberger to face the death penalty.",
      "\"The introduction of this plea deal, just weeks before the scheduled trial, is both shocking and cruel,\" Aubrie Goncalves, the youngest member of the family, wrote in a letter shared on Facebook. \"Bryan Kohberger facing a life in prison means he would still get to speak, form relationships, and engage with the world. Meanwhile, our loved ones have been silenced forever.\"",
      "In another statement\u00a0released Tuesday, the Goncalves family said they \"will not stop fighting for the life that was stolen unjustly.\"",
      "\"We stand strong that it is not over until a plea is accepted,\" they wrote. \"At a bare minimum, please - require a full confession, full accountability, location of the murder weapon, confirmation the defendant acted alone, & the true facts of what happened that night.\"",
      "The trial was originally going to be held in Latah County, where the murders occurred, but Latah County District Judge John Judge later ordered the trial be moved over concerns the media coverage and statements from local officials would make it impossible for Kohberger to receive a fair trial. The Idaho Supreme Court moved the proceedings to Boise.",
      "Kohberger's defense team had previously tried to remove the death penalty as a possible sentence if he was convicted, but Ada County Judge Steven Hippler denied their motions back in November 2024.",
      "Among the evidence prosecutors were planning to present was Kohberger's Amazon purchase history showing he bought a Ka-Bar knife with sheath and sharpener, which they claimed matched the sheath found at the crime scene. Prosecutors also claimed \"touch DNA\" matching DNA taken from Kohberger was found on the sheath. The defense tried to exclude the touch DNA evidence, but Hippler denied that request.",
      "Prosecutors were also planning to present surveillance video of Kohberger's car and cellphone data that they said tied him to the vicinity of the killings.",
      "Last week, the judge denied a motion by Kohberger's lawyers, who were seeking to argue that four \"alternate perpetrators\" could have committed the murders. The judge called it \"rank speculation\" and said \"nothing links these individuals to the homicides.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island has blocked the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing mass layoffs and overhauling some of its sub-agencies, finding there to be \"no rational basis\" for the Trump administration's reorganization plans that would have \"devastating consequences\" across the country if enacted.",
      "The suit was brought by 19 Democratic attorneys general and Washington, D.C., in May, seeking to block an agency restructuring plan announced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in March.",
      "Their complaint warned of \"severe, complicated, and potentially irreversible\" consequences to public health services nationwide if the plan went forward, potentially \"paralyzing\" the agency \"by means of a confusing reorganization.\"",
      "\"Critical public health services have been interrupted, databases taken offline, status of grants thrown into chaos, technical assistance services gone, and training and consultation services curtailed. These are not unsubstantiated fears,\" Judge Melissa DuBose wrote in her opinion granting the states' request for a preliminary injunction.",
      "\"HHS has failed to produce a shred of evidence that services to States and access to critical information would continue uninterrupted, that the harms are minimal or not irreparable, or that it is authorized to act absent Congressional action,\" she added.",
      "The judge also ordered the parties to address whether and how the Supreme Court's recent ruling limiting universal injunctions should apply to her order. In that case, which stemmed from President Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court limited the use of universal injunctions in cases with individuals as plaintiffs, but gave lower courts more latitude in cases brought by states.",
      "The states had cited concerns with the restructuring at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FDA's tobacco products center, the Office of Head Start and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.",
      "\"The Executive Branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,\" DuBose wrote.",
      "As part of Kennedy's restructuring plan, he moved to lay off some 10,000 employees at the nation's health agencies and ordered remaining officials to draw up plans to reorganize their work. Several offices and teams are slated to move under the plans, many into a new agency Kennedy wants to create called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA.",
      "Most of those employees remain off the job after getting their layoff notices in April but are still being paid, due to cases that sought to block their terminations.",
      "\"HHS is the backbone of our nation's public health and social safety net \u2014 from cancer screenings and maternal health to early childhood education and domestic violence prevention,\" said New York Attorney General James in a statement after the ruling.",
      "In May, a federal court in California blocked the Trump administration's mass layoff attempts, including at HHS, though the Supreme Court is considering whether to lift a lower court's injunction and allow it to move forward with the administration's plans for reductions in force, or layoffs.",
      "\"The people who were subject to the reduction in force are on administrative leave, and they will remain on administrative leave until the injunction is lifted,\" Kennedy said at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing last week.",
      "Multiple federal health officials said planning has been ongoing for the next steps of the reorganization and merger, even as Kennedy has cited the court rulings as a reason to dodge questions about the restructuring on Capitol Hill.",
      "Officials from the Health Resources and Services Administration visited the CDC's campuses in Atlanta in recent weeks, they said, in a meeting of senior leaders between the two agencies.",
      "Most remaining teams focused on chronic disease from the two agencies are supposed to start being transferred into the new AHA agency, Kennedy has said, if the injunction is lifted.",
      "A few hundred layoffs have also been reversed in the weeks since the initial cuts, including those of scientists, researchers and health officials the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and the FDA.",
      "But officials have also been told that further layoffs might be demanded by the Trump administration from health agencies in order to \"balance out\" the jobs that were restored.",
      "\"At that point, we will make decisions. And, you know, in some cases, there have been gaps in our ability to perform our duties. I've brought people back,\" Kennedy said.",

      "\"Today, our hearts are heavy as we share that Brother Swaggart has finished his earthly race and entered into the presence of His Savior, Jesus Christ,\" the Facebook post said. \"Today was the day he has sung about for decades. He met his beloved Savior and entered the portals of glory. At the same time, we rejoice knowing that we will see him again one day.\"",
      "Last month, Swaggart was hospitalized after going into cardiac arrest at his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, according to his son, Donnie Swaggart.",
      "The founder of his eponymous ministry, Jimmy Swaggart began preaching on the radio in the early 1960s. He founded the Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, where his family continues to preach, and his ministry also runs the SonLife Broadcasting Network, which broadcasts the Family Worship Center's services.",
      "Jimmy Swaggart developed a large following with his televised sermons in the 1980s. He made national headlines in 1988 when he was photographed outside a New Orleans-area hotel with a sex worker. He tearfully admitted to sinning, delivering an apology to his congregation during a live television broadcast, although he did not specify that he had solicited a prostitute.",
      "\"I have sinned against you,\" Swaggart said in an emotional speech to his followers. \"I beg you to forgive me.\"",
      "The incident led to him being defrocked by the Assemblies of God, although he continued to preach.",
      "Three years later, he was again found with a prostitute, this time during a traffic stop in Indio, California. He told his congregation that God said to him, \"You tell them that Thursday morning you'll be making television programs,\" adding: \"The Lord told me it's flat none of your business.\"",

    "summary": "The Senate narrowly passed a massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump's second-term agenda. Here's what's in it.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Tuesday narrowly passed a massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump's second-term agenda in a 51-50 vote that required Vice President JD Vance to break a tie.",
      "The vote came after a marathon session that featured votes on amendments to key portions of the bill by senators of both parties.",
      "At the center of what Republicans call the \"big, beautiful bill\"\u00a0is an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is slated to sunset at year's end. The legislation would make most of the tax cuts permanent, while increasing spending for border security, defense and energy production.",
      "The bill is partially paid for by cuts to health care and nutrition programs, like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the Senate's bill would add $3.3 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years and leave millions without health insurance. Republicans and the White House dispute those forecasts.",
      "Senate Republicans used a process known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, which limits the types of policies that can be included in a simple majority vote. A handful of provisions that initially appeared in the bill were ultimately removed, including one that would have ordered the sale of public lands and another that would have paused state regulations on artificial intelligence.",
      "The House passed its own version of the legislation last month, with some key differences. The lower chamber must now approve the Senate's version before it can go to the president's desk. If the House makes changes of its own, the Senate would need to sign off on those as well.",
      "Here's what is in the 887-page bill:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. Like the House-passed bill, the legislation imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. But the Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, isn't in compliance with Senate reconciliation rules.",
      "The parliamentarian also weighed in on the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in recent weeks. It's a departure from the House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $50 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Homeland security and immigration",
      "The legislation includes more than $46.5 billion for border wall construction and related expenses, $45 billion to expand detention capacity for immigrants in custody and about $30 billion in funding for hiring, training and other resources for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "It also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The Senate bill still shifts the costs of SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "The package also aligns with the House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18 and 54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18 and 64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the House-passed bill. Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, saying that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress are aiming to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the Senate bill, $300 less than the House-passed hike. The House version reverts the increase to $2,000 after 2028.",
      "Limits on overtime and tips deductions",
      "The bill would allow individuals to deduct a certain amount of tip wages and overtime from their taxes. The provisions would expire in 2028.",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate\u00a0versions\u00a0vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Changes to standard deduction",
      "The Senate wants to permanently expand the basic standard deduction, which was nearly doubled in 2017. The increases will expire at the end of the year. The House bill, however, would expand the deduction only through 2028.",

      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",

      "How would \"no tax on tips\" work?",

      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who would benefit?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all would benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants would qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees would not despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",

      "States can boost federal Medicaid contributions to their states through what's known as a provider tax, often levying taxes on health care providers, which raises the overall cost of a service and therefore increases the portion reimbursed by the state.",
      "The House measure aims to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "But their Senate counterparts want to incrementally lower provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032 in states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0Forty states have adopted the Medicaid expansion, and under that provision, the federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion enrollees while the states are responsible for 10%. The federal government's portion for those covered through traditional Medicaid can range from 50% to 83%.",
      "Senate Republicans also added a $25 billion fund to help rural hospitals after some GOP senators expressed concern about how they could be affected by the change to provider taxes.",
      "Gender transition care",
      "The House bill prohibits federal Medicaid funding from covering gender transition services for children and adults, including surgeries, hormone therapy and puberty blockers.",
      "The Senate version included a similar provision, but the parliamentarian determined that it did not comply with the chamber's rules guiding the reconciliation process, meaning it either needed to be removed or modified to be included.",
      "Planned Parenthood funding",
      "Conservatives have long tried to stop Planned Parenthood from receiving federal funds. The Hyde Amendment bans the use of any federal funds for abortion, but Planned Parenthood receives Medicaid money for other services.",
      "Both versions seek to strip Planned Parenthood from receiving any Medicaid payments. The Senate version stops the payments for one year, while the House version ends them for 10 years.",
      "Limits on retroactive coverage",
      "Currently, states must cover Medicaid benefits retroactively for three months before an eligible individual signs up for coverage. The Senate and House bills would reduce that to one month.",
      "Co-payments for services",
      "For those whose incomes are over 100% of the federal poverty level, which in 2025 is $15,650 for an individual and $32,150 for a family of four, states would be required to impose co-payments of up to $35 for medical services, with some exclusions, including for primary care.

    "summary": "A satellite program that has historically been a key source of weather forecasting data will be discontinued no later than July 31, according to a message posted by NOAA.",
    "story": [
      "A satellite program that has historically been a key source of weather forecasting data will be discontinued by July 31, as the United States enters peak hurricane season, according to the already resource-strapped National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "The federal agency, which includes the National Weather Service, initially said last week that it was going to lose access to the satellite data by June 30. But in an update\u00a0posted online on Monday, NOAA said the deadline to decommission the satellite system was pushed to July 31, at the request of a top official at NASA.",
      "Operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program has since the 1960s collected environmental information each day from satellites orbiting Earth, in order to provide real-time details about conditions in the atmosphere and oceans to the military. The data was made available to weather scientists for traditional forecasting purposes, after being processed by a branch of the Navy that focuses on meteorology and oceanography.",
      "Starting Aug. 1, that naval branch will no longer process or upload satellite data to the computing interface where meteorologists previously accessed it, according to NOAA.",
      "In an email that the agency reposted online, the deputy director of its Office of Satellite and Product Operations said the Navy decided to implement that change in efforts \"to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" but would continue to distribute the data through the end of next month. A Navy spokesperson told CBS News in an email that it is \"discontinuing contributions\" to the satellite program \"given the program no longer meets our information technology modernization requirements.\"",
      "NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster called it a \"routine process of data rotation and replacement\" in a statement to CBS News on Monday, adding that remaining data sources remaining \"are fully capable of providing a complete suite of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\"",
      "\"The DMSP is a single dataset in a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools in the NWS portfolio,\" said Doster, citing several other satellites that feed into the National Weather Service's forecasting models, including one launched recently that,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Space Force, \"advances weather monitoring.\"",
      "The data cutoff from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program comes after NOAA lost a substantial chunk of its staff to layoffs and buyouts earlier this year, stemming from President Trump's initiative to reduce government spending in part by shrinking the federal workforce.",
      "Former NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad, who served in that role during the Biden administration, told CBS News in an email that \"there's no logical explanation\" for the cutoff, \"other than some downstream benefit to the private sector\" \u2014 which would align with goals outlined in Project 2025 to move toward privatizing NOAA and the Weather Service. Losing that data puts the agency's current capabilities at risk, Spinrad said, especially during hurricane season.",
      "\"NWS is working feverishly to start using other data from a satellite DoD launched last year,\" he added. \"This is ill-timed, poorly planned, and dangerous.\"",
      "Hurricane season runs through Nov. 30, and NOAA forecasters said in May that they expected this one to be more active than an average year. The season typically reaches its \"peak,\" its most active period, around August and September.",

    "summary": "President Trump toured a new immigration detention center in South Florida that state officials are calling \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday toured the site of a new immigration detention center in South Florida that state officials are calling \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are visiting the facility alongside the president. The controversial detention facility is at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in the Florida Everglades, which has its own runway in an environment known for its treacherous terrain and wildlife. Mr. Trump joked in his remarks that \"we're going to teach them how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison.\"",
      "Mr. Trump invited the press to join his tour of the makeshift facility, which he called \"so professional and so well done.\" Rows of bunk beds were lined up behind chain fences.",
      "The president was asked if it could be a model going forward for other detention sites. \"It can be,\" he responded, adding that such a location is rare. Mr. Trump said he'd like to see similar temporary facilities in \"many states.\"",
      "DeSantis said they expect the first occupants of the detention center to arrive Wednesday. DeSantis said the site has been modified in just eight days to accommodate detainees, and he called the center an \"effective way\" to increase the numbers of removals and deportations of unauthorized immigrants as the state seeks to help the federal government's deportation efforts.",
      "The facility will have up to several thousand beds to house, process and deport individuals who were in the country illegally. Florida officials say the site will have at least 200 security cameras, at least 28,000 feet of barbed wire, 400-plus security personnel, and 24/7 air conditioning.",
      "In a roundtable alongside Mr. Trump, Noem told people who are in the country illegally and who may be watching on TV that they can still \"self-deport\" and get the chance to return to the United States legally in the future.",
      "\"If you don't, you may end up here,\" Noem said. \"And you may end up here and being processed, deported out of this country, and never get the chance to come back.\"",
      "DeSantis echoed Noem's message. \"Why would you want to come through 'Alligator Alcatraz' if you can just go home on your own?\" DeSantis said. \" I think a lot of people are going to make that decision.\"",
      "Protesters have gathered outside the gates as construction work proceeded on the site in recent days, and a crowd of demonstrators turned out again Tuesday to protest Mr. Trump's visit, CBS News Miami reported.",
      "Phyllis Andrews, a retired teacher who drove in from Naples, Florida, to join the protest, told The Associated Press, \"I have a lot of immigrants I have been working with. They are fine people. They do not deserve to be incarcerated here.\"",
      "Noem announced last week that the detention facilities in Florida will be funded \"in large part\" by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as part of FEMA's shelter and services program, an initiative created by Congress to support groups and cities receiving migrants and asylum-seekers released from federal custody along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\"There is only one road leading in and the only way out is a one-way flight,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday. \"It is isolated, and surrounded by dangerous wildlife in unforgiving terrain.\"",
      "\"They ain't going anywhere once they're there, unless you want them to go somewhere,\" DeSantis said Monday. \"Because good luck getting to civilization. So the security is amazing \u2014 natural and otherwise.\"",
      "Critics of the project include former U.S. Rep. David Jolly, an ex-Republican who is now running for Florida governor as a Democrat, who called the facility a \"callous political stunt.\"",
      "Where is \"Alligator Alcatraz\"? Map shows site in South Florida",
      "The site of the temporary migrant detention facility in Ochopee, Florida, is located deep in the Everglades, about 50 miles west of Miami, in a wetlands ecosystem known as Big Cypress Swamp.",
      "History of \"Alligator Alcatraz\" site in Florida Everglades",
      "According to the\u00a0National Park Service, Florida officials in the 1960s proposed building a futuristic jetport in the area to support South Florida's booming population. The Dade County Port Authority purchased 39 square miles of remote swampland with plans to build what would have been the largest airport in the world.",
      "But opposition to the Everglades Jetport grew, and the early work on the facility halted in 1970 after a federal report determined that it would \"inexorably destroy the South Florida ecosystem and thus the Everglades National Park.\"",
      "Instead, in the 1970s, a smaller portion of the land was developed into the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, known as TNT, an aviation training facility with only one runway.",
      "The site has about 900 acres of developed and operational land, while the remaining area is managed and operated by the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission.",
      "On June 19, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier proposed using the TNT site for a temporary facility to house U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees. He said the facility could be set up on the already constructed runway.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration recently transferred immigration detainees from countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Caribbean to detention facilities at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, dramatically expanding the nationalities of those held there, internal U.S. government records obtained by CBS News show.",
      "As of earlier this week, Guantanamo Bay's immigration detainees \u2014 who are detained separately from the terrorism suspects also held at the U.S. military base \u2014 included nationals of China, Jamaica, Liberia and the United Kingdom, according to the federal documents.",
      "Two U.S. officials said most of those detained at the base are considered to be \"high-risk\" detainees, who are defined by immigration authorities as individuals with violent or otherwise serious criminal records, histories of disruptive behavior or alleged gang ties.",
      "The transfers, which had not been previously reported, signal a significant expansion in the Trump administration's efforts to turn parts of Guantanamo Bay into immigration detention facilities to hold foreigners facing deportation.",
      "Since President Trump ordered his administration to detain \"high-priority\" foreigners with criminal records at the base earlier this year, the facilities there have mainly housed Spanish-speaking Latin American detainees from countries such as Nicaragua and Venezuela before their formal deportation.",
      "But the decision to use Guantanamo Bay to hold immigration detainees from more far-flung nations in Africa, Asia and Europe underscores the broad scope of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "A defense official told CBS News there were 54 immigration detainees at Guantanamo Bay on Tuesday.",
      "It's unclear why exactly the administration decided to transfer detainees from Asia, Africa and Europe to Guantanamo Bay. But the immigration detention system in the U.S. is well over its congressionally funded capacity, as ICE has increased efforts throughout the country to arrest immigrants in the U.S. illegally.",
      "In early June, Politico reported that officials were vetting thousands of detainees from different countries, including European allies, for a potential transfer to Guantanamo Bay, a report that the White House denied at the time.",
      "Representatives for the Departments of Homeland Security and State did not answer a series of questions, including on whether the African, Asian and European detainees are expected to be deported from Guantanamo Bay.",
      "The Trump administration's use of Guantanamo Bay to further its mass deportation agenda has garnered strong criticism and legal challenges from civil rights advocates, who argue the government does not have the authority to hold immigration detainees outside of the U.S. The base, which sits on Cuban land, was controversial before it became an immigration holding center, due to the indefinite detention of terrorism suspects, some of whom faced torture and abuse.",
      "While top Trump administration officials like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller have repeatedly highlighted the detention efforts at Guantanamo Bay, they have provided scant public information on operations at the base and who is being sent there.",
      "Reporting by CBS News and other news organizations has confirmed that the administration has sent both detainees deemed to be \"high-risk\" and \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo Bay, including Venezuelan men whose relatives have denied accusations that they were gang members.",
      "Those classified as \"high-risk\" have been detained at Guantanamo Bay's Camp VI, a part of the post-9/11 prison that still holds roughly a dozen terrorism suspects, though in a separate section of the complex.",
      "The \"low-risk\" detainees \u2014 who by definition lack a serious criminal record or any record at all, beyond civil immigration violations \u2014 have been housed at the Migrant Operations Center, a barrack-like facility on the base historically used to accommodate asylum-seekers interdicted at sea.",
      "CBS News also revealed in May an internal government memo showing that officials created a broad set of criteria for who could be sent to Guantanamo Bay that did not mention criminality, despite the president saying that only individuals who he called \"the worst\" would be held at the base.",
      "The Department of Defense told Congress in May that as of April 8 it had spent $21 million flying immigration detainees to Guantanamo Bay, or more than $26,000 per flight hour.",
      "As of Tuesday, the base's Camp 6 prison and Migrant Operations Center were housing 41 and 13 detainees, respectively, a defense official said.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to send a message of deterrence by using or proposing controversial detention centers like Guantanamo Bay to hold those accused of violating U.S. immigration law.",
      "In March, the administration flew more than 200 Venezuelans it labeled gang members to El Salvador, which imprisoned them at CECOT, its infamous maximum-security prison. More recently, the Trump administration has announced it is working with Florida state officials to set up an immigration detention center in the wetlands of the Everglades. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump visited the facility, which officials have dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"",

In that case, his business would transfer to Kouri Richins.",

In 2020, Eric Richins learned about her actions, prosecutors said, and met with an estate planning lawyer to establish a living trust. In the case of his death, his sister Katie Richins-Benson would become the manager of his estate. Kouri Richins was not informed of the trust.",
      "The new court documents allege that in July 2021, Kouri Richins began using altered bank documents showing information from Eric Richins' business for mortgage loan applications. Then, from August to December 2021, Kouri Richins issued a series of bad checks, according to the court documents, and laundered money between multiple accounts.",

      "\"Many businesses have been creative and savvy in using different means to buffer the initial shock,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That doesn't mean consumers and businesses, who were battered by the highest inflation in decades during the pandemic, are out of the woods. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, thinks prices are likely to rise as tariffs gradually push up import costs in the second half of the year.",
      "\"We still think in next few months we'll continue to see the impact of the new trade policies on price levels, and they should translate into higher inflation,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Here are three reasons why tariffs haven't driven up inflation as much as many economists expected, at least for now.",
      "Aggressive \"front-loading\"",
      "After the Trump administration announced a range of tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico and dozens of other countries earlier this year, many companies scrambled to stock up, or front-load, on products, parts and other imports to\u00a0avoid incurring added tariff costs.",
      "\"They tried to front-run the imposition of the duties by importing rapidly,\" Daco said. \"They bought goods they needed and stocked them, so that was the first line of defense against the tariffs.\"",
      "Much of that extra inventory remains in warehouses or on store shelves, allowing importers to delay price hikes.",
      "\"Lots of retailers pre-ordered inventory before the tariffs went into effect, so the inventory they're selling has not been marked up yet,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waiting for clarity",
      "Some businesses facing higher tariffs are choosing to hold off on passing any cost increases through to consumers\u00a0as they wait for the fog around U.S. trade policy to lift.",
      "The Trump administration in April froze most of its tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, with that pause due to expire on July 9. And after announcing tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports earlier this year, Mr. Trump and Chinese officials on Thursday said the two countries have agreed on the framework for a trade deal.",
      "\"We have had literally dozens of changes in tariff policy in the last five months. In that highly uncertain environment, companies that sell items that are subject to tariff may be cautious about raising prices immediately,\" Charley Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Companies often refrain from raising prices to avoid scaring away consumers and losing market share to competitors.",
      "Added Daco: \"Essentially, some business decided to not immediately pass on the cost. They said, 'Let's see if we can hold out for a month, delay some imports, use the inventory on hand and be creative in terms of our broader pricing strategy'.\"",
      "Although tariffs are paid by importers, which typically pass those costs on to consumers, some foreign exporters have also been willing to take a hit.",
      "Lower tariff costs",
      "Although Mr. Trump has announced sky-high tariff rates, the actual duties collected at the U.S. border so far are lower than the official rates. That's because some importers have been able to skirt the levies by storing goods in so-called bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones.",
      "Businesses can use bonded warehouses, which are usually located near major commercial ports, to temporarily store goods, components and other inputs without immediately having to pay tariffs or taxes.",
      "\"If you make use of a warehouse or so-called foreign trade zone, you are able to delay the payment of tariffs until these goods are put into commerce,\" Daco said. \"So it's a free-trade zone, or imaginary area that is not subject to tariffs.\"",
      "Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a number of tariff exemptions and exclusions. In practice, that has resulted in the actual levies on imports often being lower than the nominal rate initially announced by the White House.",
      "As of June, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports was around 10%, compared with an official average tariff rate of 15%.",
      "Still, business can't hold the line on price hikes indefinitely if tariffs remain elevated, experts say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0told lawmakers this week\u00a0that tariffs could yet spark higher inflation, likely starting this summer,",
      "\"Part of that is due to the start-stop nature of the tariffs that have been introduced,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For us it's a question of patience more than a mystery as to where it is,\" he added. \"The typical pass-through takes some time. We expect July to be when you start to see it more.\"",

    "summary": "The scheme involved thousands of workers who were dispatched by the North Korean government to find work as remote IT employees at American companies.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department announced criminal charges Monday in a scheme by North Korea to fund its weapons program through the salaries of remote information technology workers employed unwittingly by U.S. companies.",
      "The charges arose from what law enforcement officials described as a nationwide operation that also resulted in the seizure of financial accounts, websites and laptops that were used to carry out the fraud.",
      "Separate cases in Georgia and Massachusetts represent the latest Justice Department effort to confront a persistent threat that officials say generates enormous revenue for the North Korean government and in some cases affords workers access to sensitive and proprietary data from the American corporations that hire them.",
      "The scheme involved thousands of workers who, armed with stolen or fake identities, were dispatched by the North Korean government to find work as remote IT employees at American companies, including Fortune 500 corporations. The companies were duped into believing that the workers they hired were based in the U.S. when many were actually stationed in North Korea or China, and the wages the victimized companies paid were transferred into accounts controlled by co-conspirators affiliated with North Korea, prosecutors say.",
      "On Monday, U.S. prosecutors announced the arrest of U.S. national Zhenxing \"Danny\" Wang of New Jersey. A five-count indictment describes a \"multi-year fraud scheme by Wang and his co-conspirators to obtain remote IT work with U.S. companies that generated more than $5 million in revenue,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "The indictment also charges six Chinese nationals and two Taiwanese nationals for their roles in the scheme.",
      "\"These schemes target and steal from U.S. companies and are designed to evade sanctions and fund the North Korean regime's illicit programs, including its weapons programs,\" Assistant Attorney General John Eisenberg, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, said in a statement.",
      "In one case exposed on Monday in federal court in Massachusetts, the Justice Department said it had arrested one U.S. national and charged more than a half dozen Chinese and Taiwanese citizens for their alleged roles in an elaborate fraud that prosecutors say produced several million dollars in revenue and affected scores of companies.",
      "The conspiracy, court papers say, involved the registration of financial accounts to receive the proceeds and the creation of shell companies and fake websites to make it look like the remote workers were associated with legitimate businesses. Enablers inside the United States facilitated the workers' remote computer access, tricking companies into believing the workers were logging in from U.S. locations.",
      "The Justice Department did not identify the companies that were duped, but said that some of the fraudulent workers were able to gain access to and steal information related to sensitive military technology.",
      "The case filed in Georgia charges four North Korean IT workers with stealing virtual currency worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from their employers. The defendants remain at large.",
      "The Justice Department has filed similar prosecutions in recent years, as well as created an initiative aimed at disrupting the threat.",
      "The Justice Department has charged other people living in the U.S. with similar conduct tied to the North Korean government.",
      "Last December, a Chinese national living in California was charged after he allegedly bought and exported guns and ammunition to North Korea at the direction of North Korean agents who funneled him $2 million to buy the equipment.",
      "In May 2024, federal prosecutors\u00a0accused\u00a0an Arizona woman of carrying out a scheme to help North Korean IT workers illegally obtain remote employment with American companies. The group allegedly used the identities of more than 60 individuals who lived in the U.S. to generate nearly $7 million for the North Korean government from more than 300 U.S. companies.",

    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking case in New York shared concerns about an individual juror with the judge not long after they started deliberating Monday. The first day of deliberations ultimately ended without a verdict.",
      "After more than two hours of legal instructions from federal Judge Arun Subramanian, the jury of eight men and four women headed behind closed doors to deliberate at around 11:30 a.m. Subramanian told the five alternate jurors to remain on standby in case they're needed to fill in on the main jury who are weighing charges that could put the hip-hop mogul in prison for life.",
      "About 10 minutes into deliberations, the jury sent a note indicating they'd completed their first order of business: electing a foreperson.",
      "Less than two hours later, at about 1:25 p.m., a note from the jury was read in court  to inform the judge of concerns regarding one juror's ability to follow the instructions. The jury asked the judge to question this juror. The judge discussed the response with the prosecution and defense and decided to remind the jury of their obligation to follow the law and resume their deliberations.",
      "After the judge originally proposed asking the jury foreperson the nature of concerns about the fellow juror, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo suggested caution and that less be said rather than more.",
      "\"We can always ratchet it up. We can't ratchet it down,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the late afternoon, the jury sent the judge a new note with a question about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 stemming from the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The judge told the court he'd answer them on Tuesday and dismissed the jury for the day.",
      "Jurors are being provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",
      "Subramanian had stressed to the jury the importance of delivering a unanimous verdict, but also said no juror should surrender their beliefs in order to reach unanimity.",
      "Ahead of the deliberations, CBS News legal contributor Caroline Polisi, a criminal defense attorney, discussed on \"CBS Mornings\" what judges typically tell juries.",
      "\"The judge will instruct the jurors, 'maintain your own integrity with respect to what you believe, but keep an open mind, engage in discussions with other jurors, look at the evidence, see other people's point of view, and if you can with integrity really come over to, you know, the other side, then you can get to unanimity,'\" Polisi said.",
      "As the deliberations got underway, Combs faced his family and supporters in the courtroom gallery. They bowed their heads in prayer \u2014 his family members holding hands with each other. When they finished, they all applauded.",
      "The judge granted Combs' request to have some books with him during the deliberations. On his way out of the courtroom on Monday, Combs showed two books to reporters: \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" and \"The Happiness Advantage.\"",
      "The jury will sift through seven weeks of sometimes graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking \u2014 relating to two of his ex-girlfriends \u2014 and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "Polisi said the prosecution's best chance at getting a conviction could be with the sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"The prosecution made clear there only has to be one instance, out of these hundreds of 'freak-offs,' one instance where it was coerced by force, fraud or coercion, and that can include threats of harm that doesn't even include physical harm,\" Polisi said. \"So that can include fear of financial harm, fear of reputational harm. Remember, he videotaped all of these encounters, and the government laid out specific instances where he threatened to release those tapes.\"",
      "In closing arguments last week, federal prosecutors and Combs' defense team took their last shots at convincing jurors to convict or acquit the Grammy Award-winning founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law.\"",
      "She said that he used his \"close inner circle and a small army of personal staff, who made it their mission to meet the defendant's every desire, promote his power and protect his reputation at all costs.\"",
      "Agnifilo countered, \"This isn't about crime. It's about money.\" He noted that one of Combs' accusers in the criminal case also sued him in civil court.",
      "\"He is not a racketeer. He is not a conspirator to commit racketeering. He is none of these things. He is innocent. He sits there innocent. Return him to his family, who have been waiting for him,\" the lawyer told jurors.",
      "In all, 34 witnesses testified, headlined by Combs' former girlfriends Cassie \u2014 the R&B singer born Casandra Ventura \u2014 and \"Jane,\" who testified under a pseudonym. Both women said he often was violent toward them. Cassie said he forced her into hundreds of sexual encounters with paid male sex workers while Jane recounted numerous \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Jurors also saw now-infamous security camera video of Combs beating, kicking and dragging Cassie at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 and clips from videos of sexual encounters.",
      "Combs chose not to testify, and his lawyers didn't call any witnesses in their defense case. His attorneys elected instead to challenge the accusers' credibility during lengthy cross-examination questioning.",
      "The defense has acknowledged that Combs veered into violence, but his lawyers maintain that the sex acts were consensual. They contend that prosecutors are intruding in Combs' personal life and that he's done nothing to warrant the charges against him.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:08:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP Senate version of the \"big, beautiful bill\" would raise the cost of wind and solar projects by 10% to 20%, one energy group estimated.",
    "story": [
      "The latest version of the bill containing President Trump's second term agenda would hobble the renewable energy industry with a new excise tax, in addition to speeding up the sunsetting of tax credits and other benefits.",
      "The additional tax on wind and solar projects, which appeared on page 558 in the version of the bill released over the weekend, is estimated to increase consumer energy prices 8% to 10% and would tax clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an\u00a0analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax would apply to all projects that go into construction after June 16 through 2036, and it would also apply to projects that are placed into service after 2027, even if they already are under construction.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Politico Monday that she planned to introduce an amendment that would tie eligibility for the wind and solar tax credits to a project's construction start date, rather than its service date. The Senate is currently holding a marathon vote series on\u00a0proposed amendments to the bill.",
      "These wind and solar projects would have to pay the tax if a certain percentage of the value of their materials are sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. The provision is ostensibly designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components would be cost prohibitive, and some data and AI companies \u2014 which require prodigious amounts of energy \u2014 could turn to China or other countries for reliable and affordable power sources, according to clean power experts.",
      "The Senate bill also scales back or eliminates renewable energy tax breaks that have been in place since 2005 and revised and expanded a few times since then, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The most recent expansion contained tax breaks for individuals for electric vehicles, wind and solar development, and energy efficient appliances and provided tax credits for clean electricity-generating projects that went into service from 2023 through the end of 2032.",
      "Both the Senate and the House would end the renewable energy tax credits, but the Senate would accelerate the timeline in the House version, which would end the tax credits for renewable energy projects placed in service after 2028, a year later than the Senate would.",
      "Eliminating the existing tax credits would likely kill up to 72% of the new wind and solar installations that were to be completed in the U.S. over the next decade, according to analysis from Rhodium Group, a research firm.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who until Saturday was silent on the bill after his social media spat with President Trump over the House version, said of the Senate bill that it was \"Utterly insane and destructive.\"",
      "\"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,\" he said in a post on X. And he predicted it would \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\" Musk also said, \"A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.\"",
      "According to Politico, President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to further \"crack down\" on wind and solar energy by phasing out clean energy credits faster, rather than sunsetting the tax incentives more slowly, which moderate senators favored. Some asked for help easing the hit their states would take as a result of cancelled projects, job losses and higher energy prices.",
      "The renewable energy industry, manufacturing unions and even some conservatives also criticized the new tax.",
      "Conservative energy expert Alex Epstein, advocates ending the green tax credits, but he appeared to be taken by surprise by the excise tax, saying in a post on X, \"I just learned about the excise tax and it's definitely not something I would support.\"",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also quickly condemned the tax.",
      "Neil Bradly, the Chamber's executive vice president, said on social media, \"taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables.\u00a0 Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.\"",
      "The North American Building Trades Union, in a statement, called the bill potentially \"the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.\"",
      "\"Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,\" the statement continued. \"In some cases, it worsens the already harmful trajectory of the House-passed language, threatening an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs and over 3 billion work hours, which translates to $148 billion in lost annual wages and benefits.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 09:20:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Scientists conducting medical research are facing an existential crisis: Layoffs and budget cuts pushed by President Trump that, they say, jeopardize finding a cure for cancer.",
    "story": [
      "They might easily be mistaken for Congressional staffers, reluctant to face the day, but these are among the most accomplished cancer specialists in the country, meeting with Representatives, Senators and staff. Among them: Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, from up the road in Baltimore; and Dr. George Weiner, a cancer specialist in Iowa for more than 35 years, who has flown in frequently to lobby Congress for more research funds.",
      "Lobbying for cancer research, he says, used to be like pushing on an open door. \"Most of the time when I've come, I've met with Democrats and Republicans, and we talked about the bipartisan support for cancer research,\" Weiner said. \"This is the first time that I felt there was an existential crisis in our ability to make the type of progress that I see in front of us.\"",
      "These days, the conversation is all about thousands of layoffs \u2026 delays in research \u2026 massive budget cuts \u2013 close to a 40% proposed cut in funding for the National Cancer Institute.",
      "\"I wake up every morning looking at my phone: Did I get an email from the National Cancer Institute saying I'm no longer receiving my grants?\" said Jaffee.",
      "Has she felt the impact yet? \"Oh, yeah, we certainly have felt the impact, to the point where people are leaving,\" Jaffee replied. \"So, in our clinical research operation, which takes years to build, train research nurses, takes two years to train coordinators, takes six to 12 months, these people are leaving because the funding isn't coming in.\"",
      "I asked, \"If they keep cutting back, how long before Dr. Jaffee says, 'That's it'?\"",
      "\"I have to be honest, there are days when I do feel that,\" she replied. \"But I look around and I feel like I would be disloyal to our patients. We are in a technological revolution in cancer research. We are rapidly making discoveries that we couldn't even do ten years ago.\"",
      "\"What price do you put on life?\"",
      "Kevin Callahan was a Marine in Vietnam when he barely survived stepping on a land mine. Decades later, he was diagnosed with a killer disease: pancreatic cancer. First came surgery and chemo. Now, he's part of a clinical trial, which is where Dr. Jaffee and her colleague Dr. Neeha Zaidi come in, working to develop a vaccine to prevent pancreatic cancer from recurring.",
      "I asked Callahan, \"When you see some of the debates that are going on right now, and it relates to the National Cancer Institute and NIH \u2026\"",
      "\"It raises the hair on the back of my neck,\" he replied.",
      "Beth Callahan wasn't all that sure about the clinical trial at first, but Kevin couldn't stop thinking about all that had gone into it \u2013 getting chemotherapy as an approved treatment. \"They would shoot me up with three drugs, and the fourth one I would go home with a little bag on my chest, and it wouldn't come out until Friday. It had to be done over 40 hours. I thought to myself, 'How many poor bastards went through tests to get that done?' So I thought, 'If there's anything that I can do, I'm more than happy to go in with the study and see if I can help somebody else later on, [to] develop this vaccine.'\"",
      "Pancreatic cancer is particularly nasty, even when, as with Kevin, it's detected early. The experimental vaccine they've been administering to him is promising, but according to Jaffee, the chances of recurrence are 80%, and the chances of a patient being alive in five years is 20%.",
      "Yet, Kevin is four-and-a-half years out, without recurrence, \"part of a small cohort of patients who received the vaccine on that trial who are, like him, doing well without recurrence,\" Jaffee said.",
      "I asked, \"Could it be anything other than the vaccine?",
      "Jaffee replied, \"We don't believe so. This is not a cancer where sometimes it looks less aggressive than other times. This is a cancer that uniformly \u2013 it doesn't matter who you are \u2013 it comes back.\"",
      "And so far, it has not. Kevin says, \"Bottom line, I'm cancer free.\"",
      "Now the Callahans are concerned the cuts at the NIH could interfere with \u2013 or even stop \u2013 Kevin's vaccine trial.",
      "I said, \"They claim that they're not cutting back on any of the science, on any of the people who are really doing the research.\"",
      "\"I don't believe that for a minute,\" said Kevin.",
      "Asked if it is worth the money invested by taxpayers, Beth responded: \"What price do you put on life? It's our lives. It's our children's lives. It's our grandchildren's lives. What price do you put on that? We're not just talking about cutting funding to individual research programs. We're talking about NIH, which is a gift that we have had in this country for decades. Why would we give that up as a country?\"",
      "Located just outside of Washington, D.C., the National Cancer Institute is the crown jewel of the National Institutes of Health. It is also the most expensive. Its budget last year was $7 billion.",
      "Dr. Weiner noted, \"Mary Lasker, who was a brilliant woman and a force of nature who worked with Richard Nixon on the original war on cancer, would say, 'If you think research is expensive, try disease.'\"",
      "The Trump administration is proposing cutting that $7 billion cancer budget down to about $4.5 billion. Weiner thinks that America's widely-recognized position as the world's leader in medical research is at a tipping point. \"Progress is gonna be proportional to investment,\" he said. \"So, progress is not gonna totally stop if funding drops dramatically. But the more it drops and the longer it drops, the slower progress will be.",
      "\"But that's not the case for patients,\" he said. \"Our job as researchers is to bring those advances to help those patients as soon as possible, because those patients can't wait.\"",
      "That would describe Natalie Phelps' dilemma to a T.",
      "\"When is cancer political?",
      "Natalie Phelps has Stage 4 metastatic colorectal cancer. \u00a0She and her husband, Jeff, live out in Washington State.",
      "\"We have one boy, one girl, and a giant German Shepherd, very average American,\" she said. \"And I had always hoped, if I needed a clinical trial, I was like, 'I'm gonna get to the NIH. I'm gonna go to the top place in the world.'\"",
      "Phelps was invited to NIH for testing to determine if she qualified for a promising breakthrough immunotherapy treatment that has shrunk tumors in about a quarter of the patients with gastrointestinal cancers. \u00a0She said, \"When I was invited to go back, I had cancer patients congratulating me. They were like, 'You made it!' It's like making it into the Olympics when you're a cancer patient.\"",
      "The clinical trial is run by Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a legend in the field of cancer research who is still practicing in his mid-eighties. \"Well, she's a young woman with a metastatic cancer, and so that's a desperate situation. Every patient we see here at the National Cancer Institute has been through all standard treatments that haven't worked. And they come here to the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, of Hope, trying to see if some experimental treatments might be of help to them.\"",
      "In late May, Natalie Phelps finally qualified for Rosenberg's clinical trial. But budget cuts at NIH had already slowed the trial down. NIH has lost about 1,500 employees.",
      "\"We did lose two technicians that are involved in producing the materials that are used to treat patients,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "\"And would that cause a significant delay?\" I asked. \"When I say 'significant,' I mean in Natalie's case she feels that it has been delayed by a month. Is that correct?\"",
      "\"That's correct.\"",
      "\"A month could be critical for her.\"",
      "\"It certainly can when you have metastatic cancer that's growing,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "That one-month delay means Natalie's specialized immune cell therapy won't be ready until late July. I said to her, \"I don't even know what seems like an appropriate question. You must be devastated.\"",
      "\"Well, yeah, Ted,\" she replied. \"I was diagnosed in 2020 during COVID, after giving birth to my second child. And I had to spend the first bit of my child's life changing diapers and doing bottles with the chemotherapy pump attached to me. I've done 48 rounds of chemotherapy. I've had multiple aggressive surgeries and radiation. And I have been in treatment for five years, hoping that I can raise her, but at the very least let her have a memory of who her mother was.",
      "\"I have endured so much, and now I have another hurdle just because of funding cuts?\" she said. \"I mean, my husband and I can't believe it. When is cancer political?\"",
      "In a recent online statement, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya pushed back on concerns about budget cuts and employee layoffs. He said, \"As to the current re-organization, no clinical trial has been delayed, nor has any participant been dropped from any clinical trial\u2026\"",
      "Natalie Phelps is just one patient, one case out of many; but her participation in a clinical trial was delayed, because two specialized technicians were let go.",
      "And that delay has proved to be devastating. She sent us a video message a couple of days ago from NIH:",
      "\"I got my test results back today and I didn't pass,\" she said. \"I have several new brain tumors, and it's not safe for me to participate in the trial. The earliest I could get back here for treatment would be about six weeks after having the tumors radiated, provided that the radiation's successful. I don't know. It's a long time.\"",
      "As for the budget cuts that caused the layoffs that produced the delay, it probably won't help much to learn that they were nothing personal.",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs\u00a0was portrayed in his lawyer's closing argument on Friday as the victim of an overzealous prosecution that tried to turn the recreational use of drugs and a swinger lifestyle into a racketeering conspiracy that could put the music mogul behind bars for life.",
      "Attorney Marc Agnifilo mocked the government's case against Combs and belittled the agents who seized hundreds of bottles of Astroglide lubricant and baby oil at his properties as he began his four-hour presentation Friday in a New York courtroom.",
      "\"Way to go, fellas,\" he said of the agents.",
      "He said prosecutors had \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes to combine it with recreational drug use and call it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Agnifilo said of Combs: \"He sits there innocent. Return him to his family who have been waiting for him.\"",
      "Agnifilo called Combs' prosecution a \"fake trial\" and ridiculed the notion that he engaged in racketeering. \"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?\" Agnifilo asked. \"Did any witness get on that witness stand and say yes, I was part of a racketeering enterprise \u2014 I engaged in racketeering?\" No, Agnifilo argued, telling jurors that those accusations were a figment of the prosecution's imagination.",
      "The lawyer argued prosecutors had invaded Combs' most intimate personal affairs, telling jurors: \"Where's the crime scene? It's your sex life.\"",
      "Agnifilo also argued there's another factor at play in the allegations that women have lobbed against Combs: the prospect of draining him of his wealth through lawsuits.",
      "\"This isn't about crime. It's about money. This is about money,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the prosecution's rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said Agnifilo had spent \"a whole lot of energy\" trying to distract from Combs' \"inexcusable behavior.\"",
      "\"Make no mistake,\" Comey told jurors, \"this trial was about how in Sean Combs' world, 'no' was never an option.\"",
      "In his closing argument, Agnifilo reiterated that the defense \"owns\" the fact that Combs was violent but argued that behavior does not justify the grave charges against him.",
      "Combs and R&B singer\u00a0Cassie Ventura Fine\u00a0had a \"loving, beautiful relationship,\" albeit a \"complicated\" one, Agnifilo said. \"If racketeering conspiracy had an opposite, it would be their relationship,\" Agnifilo said. \"They were deeply in love with each other.\"",

      "Dr. Shoo Lee, a retired Canadian neonatologist, said the group of 14 doctors had concluded that the newborns died either of natural causes or from insufficient medical care.",
      "\"In summary then, ladies and gentlemen, we did not find murders,\" Lee said at the time",
      "Letby has maintained her innocence.",

McDonald said he had submitted an application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which has the power to send cases back to the Court of Appeal.",
      "The CCRC has given no date for when a decision might be reached.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Tuesday, McDonald said that despite the news of the three new arrests, \"the concerns many have raised will not go away, and we will continue to publicly discuss them.\"",
      "\"What is needed is a proper and full public inquiry into the failings of the neonatal and paediatric medical care unit at the Countess of Chester hospital,\" McDonald said, repeating his assertion that Letby was wrongfully convicted.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump recently indicated diplomatic talks with Iran could restart as soon as this week, although the White House noted no talks were officially scheduled. After U.S. airstrikes on some of Iran's nuclear facilities, followed days later by a\u00a0ceasefire to end what Mr. Trump called the\u00a012-day war between Iran and Israel, Iran's foreign minister seemed less certain about a speedy return to diplomacy.",
      "\"I don't think negotiations will restart as quickly as that,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CBS News through a translator.",
      "\"In order for us to decide to reengage, we will have to first ensure that America will not revert back to targeting us in a military attack during the negotiations,\" Araghchi said in his first interview with an American media outlet inside Iran since the bombings. \"And I think with all these considerations, we still need more time.\"",
      "However, Araghchi also insisted, \"The doors of diplomacy will never slam shut.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said during a televised address following the American strikes on June 21 that Iran's Fordo nuclear enrichment site and the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear facilities had been \"completely and totally obliterated.\" Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a news conference, \"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction.\"",
      "Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency,\u00a0told CBS News the U.S. strikes caused \"severe damage, but it's not total damage.\" Grossi said Iran could likely start enriching uranium again within a few months.",
      "\"One cannot obliterate the technology and science for enrichment through bombings,\" Araghchi said. \"If there is this will on our part, and the will exists in order to once again make progress in this industry, we will be able to expeditiously repair the damages and make up for the lost time.\"",
      "When asked if Iran intends to continue enriching uranium, Araghchi said the country's \"peaceful nuclear program has turned into a matter of national pride and glory. We have also gone through 12 days of imposed war, therefore, people will not easily back down from enrichment.\"",
      "After 12 days of missile exchanges between Iran and Israel, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared victory, writing on social media, \"I offer my congratulations on the victory over the fallacious Zionist regime,\" and claiming Israel's government was \"practically knocked out and crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded on social media, calling Khamenei's declaration a lie, saying Iran had been \"decimated\" and claiming he prevented both the U.S. and Israeli militaries from assassinating the supreme leader.",
      "Mr. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet at the White House next Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump has also indicated he could order strikes on Iran again should it resume enriching uranium beyond a certain level. Araghchi questioned the legality of such action and said Iran was prepared for more attacks.",

      "The charges arose from what law enforcement officials described as a nationwide operation that also resulted in the seizure of financial accounts, websites and laptops that were used to carry out the fraud.",
      "Separate cases in Georgia and Massachusetts represent the latest Justice Department effort to confront a persistent threat that officials say generates enormous revenue for the North Korean government and in some cases affords workers access to sensitive and proprietary data from the American corporations that hire them.",
      "The scheme involved thousands of workers who, armed with stolen or fake identities, were dispatched by the North Korean government to find work as remote IT employees at American companies, including Fortune 500 corporations. The companies were duped into believing that the workers they hired were based in the U.S. when many were actually stationed in North Korea or China, and the wages the victimized companies paid were transferred into accounts controlled by co-conspirators affiliated with North Korea, prosecutors say.",
      "On Monday, U.S. prosecutors announced the arrest of U.S. national Zhenxing \"Danny\" Wang of New Jersey. A five-count indictment describes a \"multi-year fraud scheme by Wang and his co-conspirators to obtain remote IT work with U.S. companies that generated more than $5 million in revenue,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "The indictment also charges six Chinese nationals and two Taiwanese nationals for their roles in the scheme.",
      "\"These schemes target and steal from U.S. companies and are designed to evade sanctions and fund the North Korean regime's illicit programs, including its weapons programs,\" Assistant Attorney General John Eisenberg, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, said in a statement.",
      "In one case exposed on Monday in federal court in Massachusetts, the Justice Department said it had arrested one U.S. national and charged more than a half dozen Chinese and Taiwanese citizens for their alleged roles in an elaborate fraud that prosecutors say produced several million dollars in revenue and affected scores of companies.",
      "The conspiracy, court papers say, involved the registration of financial accounts to receive the proceeds and the creation of shell companies and fake websites to make it look like the remote workers were associated with legitimate businesses. Enablers inside the United States facilitated the workers' remote computer access, tricking companies into believing the workers were logging in from U.S. locations.",
      "The Justice Department did not identify the companies that were duped, but said that some of the fraudulent workers were able to gain access to and steal information related to sensitive military technology.",
      "The case filed in Georgia charges four North Korean IT workers with stealing virtual currency worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from their employers. The defendants remain at large.",
      "The Justice Department has filed similar prosecutions in recent years, as well as created an initiative aimed at disrupting the threat.",
      "The Justice Department has charged other people living in the U.S. with similar conduct tied to the North Korean government.",
      "Last December, a Chinese national living in California was charged after he allegedly bought and exported guns and ammunition to North Korea at the direction of North Korean agents who funneled him $2 million to buy the equipment.",
      "In May 2024, federal prosecutors\u00a0accused\u00a0an Arizona woman of carrying out a scheme to help North Korean IT workers illegally obtain remote employment with American companies. The group allegedly used the identities of more than 60 individuals who lived in the U.S. to generate nearly $7 million for the North Korean government from more than 300 U.S. companies.",

      "Joshua Brown, 26, was charged with more than 70 offenses, including child rape and attempted rape and possession of child sexual abuse material, the Victoria Police said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\"The most important thing for our investigators was that we needed to identify the victims involved,\" Acting Commander Janet Stevenson of the Victoria Police's Crime Command said Tuesday. \"These are some of the most vulnerable members of our community and the conversations police have had to have with their families were no doubt life changing in the worst possible way.\"",
      "The charges relate to eight alleged victims from one child care centre in the Melbourne suburb of Point Cook, between April 2022 and January 2023, but authorities fear more children may have been affected. Brown worked at more than 20 child care centers in the region between 2017 and his arrest in May 2025, according to the police.",

      "A 92-year-old man on Monday was convicted of the rape and murder of a woman in southwestern England in what is thought to be the U.K.'s longest-running cold case ever to be solved.",
      "A jury at Bristol crown court found Ryland Headley, then aged 34, guilty of attacking 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in June 1967. He was sentenced to life in prison on Tuesday.",
      "\"Louisa Dunne died in a horrifying attack carried out in the place where she should have felt safest \u2014 her own home,\" prosecutor Charlotte Ream said. \"For 58 years, this appalling crime went unsolved and Ryland Headley, the man we now know is responsible, avoided justice.\"",
      "Dunne was found dead in her home by a neighbor on June 28, 1967. The night of her death, neighbors reported hearing a woman's \"frightening scream,\" the BBC reported.",
      "The cause of her death was found to be strangulation and asphyxiation. She had also been raped.",
      "It is \"one of the oldest cold cases to ever be solved in the U.K.,\"\u00a0said the Crown Prosecution Service\u00a0(CPS), which brings criminal prosecutions.",
      "Headley  was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 20 years at Bristol Crown Court in southwest England on Tuesday.",
      "After passing sentence, judge Derek Sweeting told Headley: \"You will never be released, you will die in prison.\"",
      "Investigators retained Dunne's clothing, including a blue skirt, and other samples from her body for further examination. They also recovered a palm print from a window which Headley is believed to have used to gain entry to her home.",
      "Despite the efforts of police investigating Dunne's death 58 years ago, no key suspect was identified, the BBC reported. Police collected about 19,000 prints from men and boys at the time with no success.",
      "In 2023, the case was reexamined and the skirt was sent away for forensic testing in May last year. DNA recovered from the item of clothing linked Headley to the murder scene after his DNA was added to the national database in 2012 for an unrelated incident.",
      "Forensic scientists concluded that DNA from the skirt matched Headley's and the palm print was also his. Headley was arrested at his home in Suffolk in November.",
      "Headley was convicted of two counts of rape in the late 1970s, after he attacked women, aged 79 and 84, in Ipswich. He pleaded guilty to the charges in 1978 and was jailed for seven years.",
      "All but one of the trial witnesses in the case died, according to the CPS, so the prosecution had to rely on written accounts taken from witnesses at the time of the murder.",
      "Testimonies of the two women were read during Headley's 2025 trial.",
      "\"Hearing the voices of the victims of his 1977 offences, is just incredibly powerful and harrowing,\" said Detective Inspector Dave Marchant, senior investigating officer for the case. \"I think it gives us an insight into probably what happened within 58 Britannia Road (Dunne's home) to some degree.\"",
      "Because witnesses were not available to give evidence in court, and therefore could not be challenged on that evidence, their statements had to be treated as hearsay evidence instead, the CPS noted.",
      "Dunne's granddaughter Mary Dainton said she was stunned when she heard that Headley had been arrested. \"I accepted that some murders just never get solved and some people have to live with that emptiness and sadness,\" she said.",
      "Marchant said he is working with the National Crime Agency to determine whether Headley may be responsible for any other unsolved offenses over the years. \"Crimes of this magnitude should never go unpunished and we will remain relentless in ensuring we do everything we can to advance other unsolved murder cases in the Avon and Somerset area,\" he said.",

The [BBC broadcasting] team were dealing with a live situation but with hindsight we should have pulled the stream during the performance. We regret this did not happen.\"",
      "The BBC, which is CBS News' partner network in the U.K., quickly acknowledged that the language used on Saturday was \"deeply offensive,\" but the network was criticized \u2014 including by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and members of his cabinet \u2014\u2014 for not reacting more quickly after the chant started.",
      "Glastonbury festival's organizers also condemned the chant in a statement, saying: \"Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\"",

      "\"Let us display to them loudly and visibly the right thing to do when we want and need change,\" the band said. \"Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organizing online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered.\"",

The event is hosted and organized by the Eavis family, who still own the farm, and has been running for about 55 years.",
      "Bob Vylan's performance preceded that of Northern Irish rappers Kneecap, whose set the BBC did not air live due to previous instances at the group's concerts involving alleged comments supporting Hamas and Hezbollah and calling for the death of Conservative party lawmakers.",

      "Tehran \u2014 Seyed Rahim Bathaei has long been CBS News' eyes and ears in Iran. For 16 years, he's helped us introduce our audience to regular Iranians who've shared their hopes and fears.",
      "For all of those years, Iranian society has been divided between those who ardently support the Islamic Republic's theocratic rulers, and those who do not. Yet after 12 days of devastating war with Israel, CBS News has seen a level of national unity that wasn't there before.",
      "\"Iran is an ancient country with an ancient civilization, more than 5,000 years of history. They want to preserve it,\" Bathaei explains of his fellow Iranians. \"They say: 'We are the nation. We have a national identity. Don't smash \u2014 don't try even to smash \u2014 or don't insult our pride and this deep civilization.'\"",
      "For Bathaei, the military clash between the Middle East's archrivals had felt inevitable for some time.",
      "\"I was expecting this,\" he says. \"Iran has had this strong belief to support Palestinians and the Palestinian cause, and has not been shy to project it quite openly. So, it was obvious at some point \u2014   no one knew when \u2014 but this would come, that Iran and Israel would go on a direct war, direct confrontation instead of proxy wars. On Israel's side, doing assassination, covert operations, and on the Iranian side, fighting against Israel through what is called nowadays Iran's proxy groups. So, at some point, it was quite inevitable that both countries would have come to this boiling point.\"",
      "Israel, backed by its close ally the U.S., may well have the military capacity to bring down the government led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But Bathaei says such a move \u2014   which President Trump claims to have personally prevented during the 12 days of fighting \u2014   would have serious consequences beyond Iran's borders.",
      "\"That would be a disaster. We have already seen what happened in Libya, what happened to Syria. Iraq, actually, is a big example for us. That's a disaster for the region,\" he says. \"There will be a failed state that there might be terrorism coming out of.\"",
      "That threat may no longer feel imminent, and the ceasefire President Trump brokered between Iran and Israel has held for nearly a week, but Bathaei \u2014 relying entirely on gut feelings that come from more than 35 years as a journalist in Iran \u2014 still struggles to find optimism.",
      "\"I think we are going toward darker things,\" he says. \"I'm not a fortune teller, but my instinct tells me, yes, we are going toward darker things. But I strongly I hope I'm wrong.\"",
      "One thing did surprise Bathaei during the war with Israel: President Trump ordering U.S. warplanes to join in the bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "\"President Trump was full of surprises,\" he says. \"I was not thinking that he might have gone that far.\"",
      "\"I don't think the Iranian leadership were ready, or believed that the U.S. might attack Iran on that level,\" adds Bathaei.",
      "Now, he's worried that the U.S. could attack Iran again.",
      "The solution, Bathaei believes, is for both sides to sit down and talk it out.",
      "\"They're not talking to each other. If they sit down and start a conversation or even visit each other \u2014 I mean, Iranian politicians go and visit the U.S., U.S. politicians coming here and visit Iran \u2014 I believe a big portion of this misunderstanding can be eliminated. I'm not saying Iran and the U.S. will go be a friend, be allies, in the near, foreseeable future, but I think it's not something impossible.\"",

    "summary": "\"It is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage,\" IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
    "story": [
      "Iran's nuclear capabilities suffered \"severe damage\" in last week's U.S. airstrikes but not \"total damage,\" said the man in charge of the world's global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. \"One cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there.\"",
      "\"It is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage, first of all,\" IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And secondly, Iran has the capacities there; industrial and technological capacities. So if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again.\"",
      "The U.S. launched three strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities on June 21, following more than a week of Israeli attacks, which President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said had \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "But Grossi's comments appeared to support an early assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which suggested the strikes had only set back Iran's nuclear program by months. The Trump administration has slammed the DIA's assessment as \"low confidence,\" and Hegseth and other officials on Thursday went after the media for reporting on a \"leaked\" report.",
      "At a briefing Thursday, reporters questioned Hegseth repeatedly on whether Iran had moved its stocks of enriched uranium before the Israeli and U.S. strikes began. The defense secretary responded that he was \"not aware of any intelligence that I've reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be \u2014 moved or otherwise.\"",
      "Grossi on Sunday said Iran did not share that they had any plans to move the enriched uranium, but at the same time \"there was no physical time\" for Iran to share that information.",
      "The IAEA director general also conceded that it's \"logical to presume that when [Iran] announce[s] that they are going to be taking protective measures\" that moving the enriched uranium \"could be part of it.\" But he also emphasized that \"this is why it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to continue their indispensable work as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brennan pushed Grossi that since it's unclear if the uranium had been moved and all the centrifuges cannot be accounted for, there's an open question that Iran could still \"sprint towards a bomb\u2026if they wanted to.\" Grossi said he didn't want to be an \"alarmist,\" but \"we need to be in a position to ascertain, to confirm what is there, and where is it and what happened.\"",
      "\"Iran had a very vast ambitious program, and part of it may still be there, and if not, there is also the self-evident truth that the knowledge is there,\" Grossi said. \"The industrial capacity is there. Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. So you cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have. It's a huge country, isn't it? So I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military operations or not, you are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily.\"",
      "Grossi confirmed that his IAEA inspectors were never able to verify Iran's claims that its nuclear program was only for peaceful ends and that it was not trying to develop a weapon.",
      "\"We didn't see a program that was aiming in that direction, but at the same time, they were not answering very, very important questions that were pending,\" Grossi said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Saturday that there were calls in Iran for the arrest and execution of Grossi.",
      "When asked about alleged threats against nuclear inspectors, Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, said in a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation\" that Iran is not threatening nuclear inspectors, including Grossi.",
      "Nuclear inspectors \"are in Iran,\" Iravani said. He said they are in a \"safe condition,\" but \"they cannot have access to our site.\"",
      "Iravani also said that since Iran is a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), nuclear \"enrichment is our right, and an inalienable right, and we want to implement this right.\"",
      "Iravani added that he did not think the enrichment will \"ever stop.\"",

    "story": [
      "An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a \"matriarchal society\" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published\u00a0in Science this week.",
      "Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a \"Mother Goddess\" cult and signs of a matriarchal society.",
      "A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building.",
      "During the early years in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said.",
      "Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males.",
      "\"We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line \u2014 a matrilineal system,\" study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and\u00a0found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the\u00a0journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said.",

      "Sean \"Diddy Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial came to a close after seven weeks on Friday as the rapper's defense team and prosecution completed closing arguments.",
      "Both sides saw wins and losses throughout the trial, but experts claimed Diddy \"might be cooked\" on one specific charge as the jury prepares to deliberate. After his arrest in September 2024, the \"Last Night\" singer was charged with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
      "Former Danity Kane singer and Diddy prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Aubrey O'Day, has been following the trial and isn\u2019t sure what the outcome will be. While she personally believes the rapper is \"guilty of all the charges,\" the musician isn't sold on the prosecution's case in court.",

      "\"The rational, justice side of me that leads a good amount of what I do nowadays says the answer should be what was proven by the prosecution, the law, and that\u2019s conflicting to what I want personally,\" she told Extra.",
      "She noted: \"I don\u2019t know if the prosecution proved [Diddy's crimes] without a doubt, though.\"",
      "DIDDY SAYS NOT TESTIFYING IS \u2018SOLELY MY DECISION,\u2019 BOTH SIDES REST IN SEX CRIMES TRIAL",
      "During closing arguments, prosecutors argued that Diddy ran an alleged criminal enterprise with full control. They pointed out that the jury heard testimony, saw texts, viewed bank records and heard audio showing the rapper committing crime after crime for decades. According to the prosecution, the government showed that Diddy didn\u2019t take no for an answer. Up until today, Diddy was able to get away with crime because of his money and power,\u00a0Assistant U.S. Attorney Christine Slavik said. \"That stops now.\"",
      "Here's where experts say things stand for each charge against Diddy with the jury about to deliberate.",
      "WATCH: DEFENSE ATTORNEY BREAKS DOWN \u2018TROUBLING\u2019 TREND WITH DIDDY DEFENSE TEAM",
      "As to the transportation to engage in prostitution charge, an expert told Fox News Digital, Diddy might be in trouble.",
      "\"The sex workers were very clear about their role and their purpose for being transported across state lines; it was for sex and not something else,\" criminal defense attorney Eric Faddis explained. \"Diddy might be cooked on this charge.\"",
      "However, the defense did find a way to show the jury a different explanation in an attempt to undermine the government's argument. \"Defense got an employee of one of the companies to say that Diddy was just buying the escorts' time and not any sexual performance, which the jury could use as a basis to acquit Diddy on the transportation charges,\" Faddis, a founding partner of Colorado-based Varner Faddis, said.",

      "A sketch portrays Sean \"Diddy\" Comb in federal court during his trial in New York City, June 26, 2025. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "The jury is unlikely to find Diddy not guilty of racketeering, criminal defense attorney John W. Day told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The only thing Diddy and his team can hope for is a miracle where the jurors don't buy the government's claim that this was racketeering and that Diddy was the head of a criminal empire dedicated to fulfilling his desires,\" the founder of New Mexico-based law practice, John Day Law, explained. \"A defense win is more likely if the jurors are conflicted on the racketeering charges and can't reach a unanimous verdict. That could lead to a hung jury on one or more of the charges. But the jurors spent the entire trial waiting to see how Diddy's lawyers rebutted the massive case against him, and they merely rested without putting on any witnesses. That leaves the jury picking through the government's case to see if this really rises to racketeering, and if not, they may hang or acquit on some of the charges \u2013 but it's unlikely.\"",

      "According to the legal expert, the prosecution \"presented overwhelming evidence\" that Diddy \"presided over this little kingdom of criminal activity designed to make him happy \u2013 and made a compelling case to the jury that this met all the elements of racketeering, sex trafficking, and transportation for prostitution.\"",
      "\"The prosecution can withstand an acquittal or a hung jury on some of the counts, but the prosecutors really need a conviction for racketeering to claim total victory,\" Day added. \"Again, that can be a difficult charge to convict on if the jurors don't buy the theory that this entire business empire was engaged in sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. But the defense needed to have convinced at least one juror that the case wasn't there, and that witnesses were lying to save their own necks. And that's a tough sell to a jury that spent weeks listening to horrific testimony about Diddy and his empire.\"",

      "But the big question remains: Will the 33-year-old democratic socialist from Queens \u2014 who defeated former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo \u2014 face Cuomo again in November\u2019s general election?",
      "The New York City Board of Elections posted the official results of three rounds of the ranked choice voting from last week's mayoral primary, and Mamdani grabbed a majority in the third round, with 56% of the vote.",
      "Cuomo, the three-term governor who resigned from office in 2021 amid multiple scandals and who was aiming for a political comeback, won 44% of the vote. Cuomo was the frontrunner in the mayoral primary race for months until Mamdani closed the gap in the closing weeks of the campaign.",

      "Mamdani, whose showing last week sent political shock waves across the nation, grabbed more than 545,000 votes, the highest total for a New York City Democratic mayoral primary winner in nearly four decades. And more than 1 million ballots were cast in the primary, the largest total since 1989.",
      "\"I am humbled by the support,\" Mamdani wrote in a social media post. And he vowed: \"This is just the beginning of our expanding coalition to make New York City affordable. And we will do it together.\"",

      "Endorsements by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive rock star and New York City's most prominent leader on the left, and by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the progressive champion and two-time Democratic presidential nominee runner-up, helped Mamdani consolidate support on the left.",
      "WHAT MAMDANI'S STUNNING PRIMARY VICTORY MEANS FOR DEMOCRATS NATIONWIDE",

      "Azzopardi, in his statement on Tuesday, acknowledged that \"this primary saw a massive spike in voters under 30, and those who had never voted before \u2013 completely changing the overall electorate, which is why no poll or model predicted the outcome \u2013 an outcome which was also felt in council races citywide.\"",

      "\"I\u2019m not trying to be a pain on this, but after taking some time thinking this over I just want to voice my opinion and concerns on this issue and make it clear I do not agree with the reasoning for not putting this out,\" the FBI agent wrote.",
      "\"I\u2019m not satisfied with the reasoning of needing a new 1023 and HQ review as these things are everyday operational and administrative requirements,\" the agent continued. \"Most concerning to me, is stating the reporting would contradict with Director Wray\u2019s testimony. I found this troubling because it implied to me that one of the reasons we aren\u2019t putting this out is for a political reason, which goes directly against our organizations mission to remain apolitical and simply state what we know.\"",
      "FBI DIRECTOR KASH PATEL VOWS TO RESTORE TRUST IN BUREAU, HUNT DOWN BAD ACTORS 'IN EVERY CORNER OF THIS PLANET'The agent added: \"Likewise, at the field operational level, I do not feel it is our job to assess whether or not our intelligence aligns with the Director, rather we provide intelligence for people way above our pay grade (like the director) to make the call of what the FBI is seeing as a whole.\"",
      "The agent agreed that the FBI had \"an obligation to not put out reckless information where we know something to be false or will cause undue harm.\"",
      "\"However, we are also not in a sole position to determine a reporting\u2019s validity, as we only make up one USIC agency, and an incredibly small fraction of all USIC, and other FBI Sources that could report on this matter,\" the agent wrote. \"My concern is that I think it gets dangerous if we cite potential political implications as reasons for not putting out information.\"",
      "The agent also stressed that with the decision to keep the report recalled, the FBI is \"starting to drift too far into being the sole decider for the USIC regarding when information we gather is, or is not valid, or of interest to the intelligence community because it takes away the crucial opportunity from the rest of the USIC to potentially corroborate or discredit our intelligence.\"",
      "\"Chris Wray\u2019s FBI wasn\u2019t looking out for the American people \u2014 it was looking to save its own image,\" Grassley told Fox News Digital. \"Now\u2019s the time to rebuild the FBI\u2019s trust.\"",
      "(\"Now\u2019s the time to rebuild the FBI\u2019s trust,\" said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, right. (Getty; Reuters)\u00a0)",
      "He added: \"Director Patel\u2019s willingness to work with me to establish renewed transparency and accountability is a critical part of that process, and I applaud him for his efforts.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Yates explained that even though an intelligence analyst \"requested further research and re-engagement with the source, Headquarters ultimately decided not to issue a new IIR, citing a lack of additional substantiating information, even after the source was reinterviewed.\"",
      "Yates said that the FBI believed that source \"appeared to be reliable,\" and said that the FBI \"did not close the source for cause or lack of credible information.\"",
      "According to the declassified documents, the source was a China-based individual who was not a member of the Chinese Communist Party. In the re-interview, according to the documents, an Albany, New York, officer \"was able to partially corroborate some of the information s/he provided.\"",
      "\"The case agent believes the source is competent and is authentic in his/her reporting,\" a declassified FBI record states.",
      "When asked how \"confident\" the source was in the information, an agent wrote: \"very, very confident.\"",
      "\"Additional emails show that the Foreign Influence Task Force (FITF) did not approve reissuance of the IIR, citing concerns about authoritativeness and potential for disinformation by foreign actors,\" Yates explained. \"However, other than a request for information to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, we have found no information to indicate that FITF-China aggressively investigated the reported information, despite corroborating intergovernmental reporting and logical investigative leads.\"",
      "The original FBI reporting document came just a month after U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at the International Mail Facility at Chicago O'Hare International Airport\u00a0seized nearly 20,000 fraudulent driver's licenses.",
      "From January 2020 through June 30, 2020, Customs and Border Protection officers at that location reported seizing 1,513 shipments of fraudulent documents that included a total of 19,888 counterfeit US driver's licenses.",

      "\"Finally, because of this episode, FBI Headquarters set a new requirement on the field for the 2020 election; \u2018all raw reporting concerning the election will now require HQ coordination, which was not required\u2019 before,\" Yates explained to Grassley.",
      "The FBI said the records reflect \"the broader sentiment within the Albany Field Office that the recall decision and resulting suppression of the IIR raised serious questions about the integrity of the intelligence reporting process and its susceptibility to perceived political pressures.\"",
      "The FBI is continuing to investigate the matter and noted that records have been preserved within the bureau\u2019s systems.",

      "So what's in Trump's bill? Below, Fox News Digital breaks down key proposals in Senate Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "Tax cuts",
      "The bill seeks to permanently extend Trump\u2019s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which a House GOP memo from earlier this year said would avoid a 22% tax hike for American families at the end of this year.",
      "It also includes tax cuts specifically tailored to the middle and working-class, like allowing people to deduct taxes on up to $25,000 of tipped wages. That deduction would begin to phase out for people making $150,000 per year or $300,000 as a married couple.",
      "The Senate bill would also allow people to deduct up to $12,500 in overtime pay under the same income guidelines. Both the tipped and overtime wage deductions would be available through 2028.",

      "Another temporary tax break through 2028 would allow people to deduct interest paid on their car loans.",
      "For seniors aged 65 and older, the bill would give an additional $6,000 tax deduction through 2028.",
      "SALT",
      "The legislation increases the current cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions, a benefit primarily geared toward people living in high-cost-of-living areas like New York City, Los Angeles and their surrounding suburbs.",
      "The current SALT deduction cap would be raised to $40,000 for five years, before reverting down to $10,000 \u2013 where it stands now \u2013 for the subsequent five years.",
      "Blue state Republicans fought for the increase, arguing it\u2019s an existential issue for a bloc of lawmakers whose victories were decisive for the House GOP majority. However, Republicans from redder areas have criticized SALT deductions as giveaways to high-tax states as a reward for their progressive policies.",

      "Representative Young Kim, a Republican from California, speaks during a hearing March 10, 2021 on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Ting Shen-Pool/Getty Images)",
      "Medicaid",
      "Medicaid cuts have proven the biggest pain point among Republicans, though many of the changes that have been proposed are widely popular. Cuts to the widely used healthcare program account for roughly $1 trillion, according to recent analyses from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).",
      "The CBO found that under the Senate GOP\u2019s plan, nearly 12 million Americans could lose their health insurance.",
      "Stricter work requirements have been the crown jewel for the GOP. The bill would require \u200b\u200bable-bodied, childless adults between the ages of 18 and 64 to work at least 80 hours a month to maintain their benefits, or by \u200b\u200bparticipating in community service, going to school or engaging in a work program.",
      "However, there are more divisive changes, like tweaks to the Medicaid provider tax rate. The rate change would, year-by-year, lower the provider tax in Medicaid expansion states from 6% to 3.5%. The plan was tweaked to comport with Senate rules and now starts in fiscal year 2028.",
      "Just ahead of the bill's passage in the Senate, Republicans doubled a rural hospital stabilization fund pushed for by lawmakers concerned that the changes to the provider rate would shutter rural hospitals around the country.",
      "That fund was boosted to $50 billion, half of which will be distributed through grants, in chunks of $10 billion each year.",
      "Republicans also removed a ban on Medicaid benefits funding transgender healthcare, largely because it would not have complied with Senate rules.",
      "SNAP",
      "Senate Republicans\u2019 bill also includes cuts to the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps.",
      "Like tweaks to Medicaid, Republicans pushed for work requirements for SNAP for able-bodied, working-age adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years old, and for parents with children over the age of 7.",
      "The bill would also shift some of the cost burden of the program from the federal government to the states.",
      "Currently, the federal government covers the costs of SNAP, but states with a higher payment error rate would cover a greater share of benefit costs.",
      "If the error rate is 6% or higher, states would be subject to a sliding scale that could see their share of allotments rise to a range of between 5% and 15%.",
      "However, in last-minute deal-making, Senate Republicans delayed SNAP work requirements for states that have a payment error rate of 13%, like Alaska, or higher for one whole year.",

      "A failure to raise that limit \u2013 also called the debt ceiling \u2013 before the U.S. government runs out of cash to pay its obligations could result in a downgrade in the country\u2019s credit rating and potential turmoil in financial markets.",

      "While the bill cuts spending on Medicaid and other domestic programs, it includes billions of dollars in new funding for defense programs and federal immigration enforcement.",
      "The bill provides $25 billion to build a Golden Dome missile defense system, similar to Israel\u2019s Iron Dome. It would also include $45.6 billion to complete Trump\u2019s border wall, and $4.1 billion to hire new border agents.",
      "The bill would also surge an additional $45 billion to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the detention of illegal immigrants.",

    "summary": "The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components.",
    "story": [
      "A few hundred robots moved a building that covers about 43,400 square feet.",
      "Building an open-source humanoid robot has traditionally been out of reach for most people due to high costs and complex proprietary systems. While robotics has made major strides in automation, healthcare, and research, accessible robot design still poses a challenge-especially for students, hobbyists, and small research teams. Most humanoid robots are expensive, hard to modify, and difficult to repair.",
      "That's why a new project from UC Berkeley is getting a lot of attention. The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open-source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components. It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all.",

      "The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components.\u00a0 (Berkeley)",
      "Why accessible robot design is essential for innovation",
      "Building a robot from scratch usually means needing fancy equipment like CNC machines or custom electronics. Most people don't have access to those tools, which makes learning and experimentation hard. That's exactly what the Berkeley team wanted to change.",
      "The goal behind the BHL project was to create an accessible robot design that doesn't require a massive budget or a fully equipped lab. The entire robot can be made with parts ordered online and printed at home. It costs less than $5,000 to build, which is far cheaper than most commercial humanoid robots.",
      "Inside Berkeley\u2019s open-source humanoid robot",
      "The robot stands about 39 inches tall and weighs just over 35 pounds. It's powered by modular actuators that use 3D-printed cycloidal gearboxes. These gearboxes distribute pressure across larger gear teeth, which helps the joints last longer and perform more like those found in high-end commercial robots.",
      "Because the design is modular, you don't have to build the whole robot all at once. You can start by printing and testing a single actuator, then gradually move on to assembling full limbs and eventually the entire humanoid. That's a big plus for anyone just getting started with robotics or working with limited resources.",
      "It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all. (Berkeley)",
      "Open source robotics with a strong community focus",
      "Everything about the BHL robot is open source. That includes the hardware design, control software, and even a custom teleoperation system that uses SteamVR. It's built to be easy to control, simple to repair, and endlessly customizable.",
      "There's also a growing community around the project. Builders are sharing tips, upgrades, and full robot builds on Discord and GitHub. That kind of collaboration is a big part of what makes accessible robot design so powerful-it brings more people into the conversation and helps everyone learn faster.",
      "The goal behind the BHL project was to create an accessible robot design that doesn't require a massive budget or a fully equipped lab. (Berkeley)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Berkeley Humanoid Light proves that accessible robot design doesn't have to mean cutting corners. With smart engineering, affordable parts, and a commitment to openness, the team behind BHL is making it easier than ever for anyone to dive into humanoid robotics. Whether you're a student, a maker, or just curious about how robots work, this is one project that shows what's possible when technology is made for everyone.",

      "What is Meta AI, and what does the \"Discover\" tab do?",
      "Meta\u2019s AI app, launched in April 2025, is designed to be both a chatbot and a social platform. Users can chat casually or deep dive into personal topics, from relationship questions to financial concerns or health issues.",
      "What sets Meta AI apart from other chatbots is the \"Discover\" tab, a public feed that displays shared conversations. It was meant to encourage community and creativity, letting users showcase interesting prompts and responses. Unfortunately, many didn\u2019t realize their conversations could be made public with just one tap, and the interface often fails to make the public/private distinction clear.",
      "The feature positions Meta AI as a kind of AI-powered social network, blending search, conversation, and status updates. But what sounds innovative on paper has opened the door to major privacy slip-ups.",
      "Why Meta AI\u2019s Discover tab is a privacy risk",
      "Privacy experts are sounding the alarm over Meta's Discover tab, calling it a serious breach of user trust. The feed surfaces chats containing legal dilemmas, therapy discussions, and deeply personal confessions, often linked to real accounts. In some cases, names and profile photos are visible. Although Meta says only shared chats appear, the interface makes it easy to hit \"share\" without realizing it means public exposure. Many assume the button saves the conversation privately. Worse, logging in with a public Instagram account can make shared AI activity publicly accessible by default, increasing the risk of identification.",
      "Some posts reveal sensitive health or legal issues, financial troubles, or relationship conflicts. Others include contact details or even audio clips. A few contain pleas like \"keep this private,\" written by users who didn't realize their messages would be broadcast. These aren't isolated incidents, and as more people use AI for personal support, the stakes will only get higher.",

      "Even casual users should take a moment to review their settings and chat history to make sure personal details aren\u2019t being shared without their knowledge.",
      "Are AI chat platforms really private?",
      "This issue isn\u2019t unique to Meta. Most AI chat tools, including ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini, store your conversations by default and may use them to improve performance, train future models, or develop new features. What many users don\u2019t realize is that their inputs can be reviewed by human moderators, flagged for analysis, or saved in training logs.",
      "Even if a platform says your chats are \"private,\" that usually just means they aren\u2019t visible to the public. It doesn\u2019t mean your data is encrypted, anonymous, or protected from internal access. In many cases, companies retain the right to use your conversations for product development unless you specifically opt out, and finding that opt-out isn't always straightforward.",
      "If you\u2019re signed in with a personal account that includes your real name, email address, or social media links, your activity may be easier to connect to your identity than you think. Combine that with questions about health, finances, or relationships, and you\u2019ve essentially created a detailed digital profile without meaning to.",
      "Some platforms now offer temporary chat modes or incognito settings, but these features are usually off by default. Unless you manually enable them, your data is likely being stored and possibly reviewed.",
      "The takeaway: AI chat platforms are not private by default. You need to actively manage your settings, be mindful of what you share, and stay informed about how your data is being handled behind the scenes.",
      "Meta\u2019s AI app, launched in April 2025, is designed to be both a chatbot and a social platform. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect your privacy when using AI chatbots",
      "AI tools can be incredibly helpful, but without the right precautions, they can also open you up to privacy risks. Whether you're using Meta AI, ChatGPT, or any other chatbot, here are some smart, proactive ways to protect yourself:",
      "1) Use aliases and avoid personal identifiers: Don\u2019t use your full name, birthday, address, or any details that could identify you. Even first names combined with other context can be risky.",
      "2) Never share sensitive information: Avoid discussing medical diagnoses, legal matters, bank account info, or anything you wouldn\u2019t want on the front page of a search engine.",
      "3) Clear your chat history regularly: If you\u2019ve already shared sensitive info, go back and delete it. Many AI apps let you clear chat history through Settings or your account dashboard.",
      "4) Adjust privacy settings often: App updates can sometimes reset your preferences or introduce new default options. Even small changes to the interface can affect what\u2019s shared and how. It\u2019s a good idea to check your settings every few weeks to make sure your data is still protected.",
      "5) Use an identity theft protection service: Scammers actively look for exposed data, especially after a privacy slip. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft\u00a0for tips and recommendations.",
      "6) Use a VPN for extra privacy: A reliable VPN hides your IP address and location, making it harder for apps, websites, or bad actors to track your online activity. It also adds protection on public Wi-Fi, shielding your device from hackers who might try to snoop on your connection. For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices\u00a0at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/VPN.",
      "7) Don\u2019t link AI apps to your real social accounts: If possible, create a separate email address or dummy account for experimenting with AI tools. Keep your main profiles disconnected.\u00a0 To create a quick email alias you can use to keep your main accounts protected visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Mail.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Meta\u2019s decision to turn chatbot prompts into social content has blurred the line between private and public in a way that catches many users off guard. Even if you think your chats are safe, a missed setting or default option can expose more than you intended. Before typing anything sensitive into Meta AI or any chatbot, pause. Check your privacy settings, review your chat history, and think carefully about what you're sharing. A few quick steps now can save you from bigger privacy headaches later.",

      "SparkKitty goes even further than SparkCat. According to Kaspersky, SparkKitty uploads images from infected phones without discrimination. This tactic exposes not just wallet data but also any personal or sensitive photos stored on the device. While the main target seems to be crypto seed phrases, criminals could use other images for extortion or malicious purposes.",
      "Kaspersky researchers report that SparkKitty has operated since at least February 2024. Attackers distributed it through both official and unofficial channels, including Google Play and the Apple App Store.",
      "SparkKitty uploads images from infected phones without discrimination. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kaspersky found SparkKitty embedded in several apps, including one called \u5e01coin on iOS and another called SOEX on Android. Both apps are no longer available in their respective stores. SOEX, a messaging app with cryptocurrency-related features, reached more than 10,000 downloads from the Google Play Store before its removal.",
      "On iOS, attackers deliver the malware through fake software frameworks or enterprise provisioning profiles, often disguised as legitimate components. Once installed, SparkKitty uses a method native to Apple\u2019s Objective-C programming language to run as soon as the app launches. It checks the app\u2019s internal configuration files to decide whether to execute, then quietly starts monitoring the user\u2019s photo library.",
      "On Android, SparkKitty hides in apps written in Java or Kotlin and sometimes uses malicious Xposed or LSPosed modules. It activates when the app launches or after a specific screen opens. The malware then decrypts a configuration file from a remote server and begins uploading images, device metadata, and identifiers.",
      "On iOS, attackers deliver the malware through fake software frameworks or enterprise provisioning profiles. (Apple)",
      "Unlike traditional spyware, SparkKitty focuses on photos, especially those containing cryptocurrency recovery phrases, wallet screenshots, IDs, or sensitive documents. Instead of just monitoring activity, SparkKitty uploads images in bulk. This approach makes it easy for criminals to sift through and extract valuable personal data.",
      "1) Stick to trusted developers:\u00a0Avoid downloading obscure apps, especially if they have few reviews or downloads. Always check the developer's name and history before installing anything.",
      "2) Review app permissions:\u00a0Be cautious of apps that request access to your photos, messages, or files without a clear reason. If something feels off, deny the permission or uninstall the app.",
      "3) Keep your device updated:\u00a0Install system and security updates as soon as they are available. These updates often patch vulnerabilities that malware can exploit.",
      "4) Use mobile security software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious software is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Both Apple and Google removed the identified apps after being alerted, but questions remain about how SparkKitty bypassed their app review processes in the first place.

The signals are then fed into an AI-powered decoding model, which converts them into audible speech in just ten milliseconds. That's so fast, it feels as natural as a regular conversation.",
      "What's especially remarkable is that the system can recreate the user's own voice, thanks to a voice cloning algorithm trained on recordings made before the onset of ALS. This means the person's digital voice sounds like them, not a generic computer voice. The system even recognizes when the user is trying to sing and can change the pitch to match simple melodies. It can also pick up on vocal nuances, like asking a question, emphasizing a word, or making interjections such as \"aah,\" \"ooh,\" or \"hmm.\" All of this adds up to a much more expressive and human-sounding conversation than previous technologies could offer.",
      "It translates the brain signals that would normally control the muscles used for speech, allowing users to \"talk\" and even \"sing\" through a computer, almost instantly. (UC Davis)",
      "How the technology works",
      "The process starts with the participant attempting to speak sentences shown on a screen. As they try to form each word, the electrodes capture the firing patterns of hundreds of neurons. The AI learns to map these patterns to specific sounds, reconstructing speech in real-time. This approach allows for subtle control over speech rhythm and tone, giving the user the ability to interrupt, emphasize, or ask questions just as anyone else would.",
      "One of the most striking outcomes from the UC Davis study was that listeners could understand nearly 60 percent of the synthesized words, compared to just four percent without the BCI. The system also handled new, made-up words that weren't part of its training data, showing its flexibility and adaptability.",
      "The AI learns to map these patterns to specific sounds, reconstructing speech in real-time.\u00a0 (UC Davis)",
      "The impact on daily life",
      "Being able to communicate in real-time, with one's own voice and personality, is a game-changer for people living with paralysis. The UC Davis team points out that this technology allows users to be more included in conversations. They can interrupt, respond quickly, and express themselves with nuance. This is a big shift from earlier systems that only translated brain signals into text, which often led to slow, stilted exchanges that felt more like texting than talking.",
      "As David Brandman, the neurosurgeon involved in the study, put it, our voice is a core part of our identity. Losing it is devastating, but this kind of technology offers real hope for restoring that essential part of who we are.",
      "The UC Davis team points out that this technology allows users to be more included in conversations. (UC Davis)",
      "Looking ahead: Next steps and challenges",
      "While these early results are promising, the researchers are quick to point out that the technology is still in its early stages. So far, it's only been tested with one participant, so more studies are needed to see how well it works for others, including people with different causes of speech loss, like stroke. The BrainGate2 clinical trial at UC Davis Health is continuing to enroll participants to further refine and test the system.",
      "The technology is still in its early stages. (UC Davis)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Restoring natural, expressive speech to people who have lost their voices is one of the most meaningful advances in brain-computer interface technology. This new system from UC Davis shows that it's possible to bring real-time, personal conversation back into the lives of those affected by paralysis. While there's still work to be done, the progress so far is giving people a chance to reconnect with their loved ones and the world around them in a way that truly feels like their own.",

That's exactly what's happening at VenHub, a fully autonomous, AI-powered smart store that just opened at the LAX/Metro Transit Center in Los Angeles. Even if you haven't seen one in person yet, VenHub's cutting-edge tech is set to shake up how people shop all across the country.",

      "A fully autonomous, AI-powered smart store. (VenHub)",
      "What Is VenHub? The next evolution of the smart store",
      "Open 24/7 and installable in under a week,\u00a0VenHub is designed for high-traffic environments, such as transit centers, airports, and city hubs, where speed, security, and efficiency are in high demand. Instead of relying on cashiers or attendants, VenHub uses two industrial robotic arms, named Barb and Peter, to handle all product selection and delivery. The process is simple yet futuristic.",
      "Customers place their orders through the VenHub app, pay digitally, and receive a QR code. Upon arrival at the store, the customer scans the code at a secure pickup window. One of the robotic arms then retrieves the items from storage and delivers them to the window within about 90 seconds. The entire transaction is seamless, contactless, and designed to eliminate the frustrations of traditional vending machines or checkout lines.",
      "A fully autonomous, AI-powered smart store. (VenHub)",
      "AI HUMANOID ROBOT IS CHANGING THE WAY YOU BUY CARS AT DEALERSHIPS",
      "The technology powering VenHub",
      "VenHub's foundation is a sophisticated blend of robotics, artificial intelligence, and real-time analytics. The robotic arms are similar to those used in automotive manufacturing, engineered for speed, precision, and reliability. Rather than attempting to mimic human appearance, these arms are optimized for repetitive, high-accuracy tasks that are perfect for retail fulfillment.",
      "Artificial intelligence drives every aspect of store operations. AI algorithms manage inventory by tracking purchasing patterns, adjusting stock levels, and predicting demand based on time of day, location, and customer behavior. Machine vision allows the robots to accurately identify products and handle them with minimal errors or downtime. The entire system is connected through IoT sensors, providing real-time data on inventory, system health, and order status. This data-driven approach enables VenHub to operate efficiently, minimize waste, and ensure popular items are always available.",
      "From the customer's perspective, everything is managed through a mobile app. This app handles payment, order tracking, and pickup notifications, creating a frictionless and transparent shopping experience. On the backend, analytics continually refine operations, making each store smarter over time.",

      "VenHub's model offers significant advantages that could reshape retail across the country. The rapid setup time enables these stores to quickly appear in busy locations, ranging from transportation hubs to college campuses and urban centers. Since the store operates around the clock without breaks, it maximizes both convenience for shoppers and revenue for operators. Eliminating on-site staff dramatically reduces overhead, allowing for competitive pricing and improved profitability.",
      "Security is a major focus for VenHub. The store uses bulletproof glass to protect inventory and customers. If one robot requires maintenance, the other can take over, ensuring reliable service with minimal downtime. VenHub's design is also environmentally conscious, featuring compact, energy-efficient layouts and optional solar power compatibility to reduce its carbon footprint. Each store can be customized to fit local demand, whether that means stocking snacks, electronics, or other essentials.",

Skilled workers are needed to maintain, restock, and support the automated systems, shifting the workforce toward higher-paying, tech-focused positions. This trend reflects a broader shift in the economy, where automation often transforms jobs rather than eliminating them.",

      "If you're considering bringing a VenHub Smart Store to your city, here's a quick breakdown of the costs and what's included. The price for a VenHub Smart Store ranges from $250,000 to $275,000, depending on your chosen configuration. To secure your spot in the production queue, you'll need a $2,500 pre-order deposit, which is fully refundable up until production begins. Financing is available through select financial institutions, with some buyers qualifying for up to 100% financing. However, all arrangements are handled directly between you and the lender; VenHub does not influence approval decisions.",
      "Once you own a VenHub Smart Store, it's yours outright; there are no leases or franchise agreements. You have complete control over pricing, inventory, and restocking, and you can manage replenishment yourself or use VenHub's preferred fulfillment partners. A monthly software-as-a-service fee of $2,500 covers software updates, AI analytics, remote monitoring, and cloud-based management tools. If you require additional support, an optional maintenance package is available for $1,300 per month, which includes servicing and preventive care.",
      "VenHub does not secure locations for you, but they do offer guidance on choosing high-traffic spots, such as shopping centers, universities, business districts, or commuter hubs, to help maximize your store's performance. With high demand and expanding production capacity, VenHub is working to deliver stores to new owners as quickly as possible across the country.",

It's interesting to consider that this kind of smart, connected retail experience could soon become something we all use every day, without even thinking twice about it.",

The relocation of the complex in Huayang, a Shikumen-style building weighing about 7,500 metric tons (approximately 8,267 U.S. tons) and covering roughly 43,400 square feet, is truly rewriting the rules.",
      "This ambitious project is powered by an army of 432 small robots that are moving the massive structure about 33 feet each day to make way for a new underground development. Let's dive into how this is happening, why it matters and what it means for the future of urban preservation.",

      "The Huayanli complex is a set of three brick-and-wood buildings constructed between the 1920s and 1930s. Located in the heart of Shanghai's historic Zhangyuan area, these structures are classic examples of shikumen architecture, which is a unique blend of Western and Chinese design. Zhangyuan itself is over 140 years old and is one of Shanghai's largest and best-preserved shikumen neighborhoods.",

      "The relocation is not just for show. The city is building a three-story underground center beneath the complex that will include over 570,000 square feet of cultural and commercial space, a parking garage with more than 100 spots and a transportation hub that will connect three major subway lines.

      "Moving a building of this size is tough enough, but the challenge is multiplied by Zhangyuan's dense web of narrow alleys and closely packed historic buildings. Traditional relocation methods simply would not fit. The area's historic significance also means that any mistake could damage irreplaceable architecture, including the 1928 \"great hall\" that once housed a patriotic night school.",

These robots gently lift the building and slowly move it forward, inch by inch, covering about 33 feet each day. To achieve this incredible level of precision, the project relies on several advanced technologies. Special low-clearance drilling robots, which can be operated remotely, navigate tight corridors and doorways to create new foundations beneath the historic structure.",
      "Earth-moving robots equipped with folding mechanical arms, just under four feet wide, use artificial intelligence to tell the difference between clay and solid obstacles. Engineers also use building information modeling and point cloud scanning to create highly detailed 3D blueprints. These digital models help the team plan exact movement routes, avoid potential collisions and design curved paths for removing soil.",
      "To keep the construction site efficient and minimize disruption, soil is carried out using a conveyor belt system, much like an assembly line. The move is only temporary.

      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.",
      "These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",

      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "What makes this breach especially alarming is that many of the affected patients may have never even heard of Episource. As a business-to-business vendor, Episource operates in the background, working with insurers and healthcare providers, not with patients directly. The people affected were customers of those companies, yet it's their most sensitive data now at risk because of a third party they never chose or trusted. This kind of indirect relationship muddies the waters when it comes to responsibility and makes it even harder to demand transparency or hold anyone accountable.",

      "PayPal app on a smartphone\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the latest PayPal phishing scam is so convincing",
      "Most phishing scams try (and fail) to impersonate big companies. You\u2019ve probably seen the classics: weird grammar, suspicious email addresses, Microsoft spelled with a \"k\". They\u2019re laughably bad. But this scam flips the script because it uses PayPal against you. Here's how the scam operates:",
      "Exploiting real features:\u00a0Scammers abuse PayPal\u2019s \"add address\" or \"money request\" tools. By entering your email, they can trigger real emails from PayPal\u2019s real domain. And this works even if you don\u2019t have a PayPal account.",
      "Bypassing filters: Because these emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s servers (service@paypal.com), they pass all security checks and appear legitimate in your inbox.",
      "Lack of suspicion: Some versions contain no phishing links at all, just a scammer\u2019s phone number, making them even harder to detect.",
      "Panic bait: The message often claims a new address was added, or a large payment is being processed, getting your attention and provoking a quick reaction.",
      "Follow-up attacks: After the initial email, scammers may later contact you pretending to be PayPal support. Some urge you to click a link to \"secure your account\", which leads to a fake login page designed to steal your credentials.",
      "THE DARK SIDE OF PAYPAL AND HOW TO STAY SAFE",
      "Real examples of the PayPal phishing scam in action",
      "This scam has been reported by dozens of users on Reddit and cybersecurity forums. One Reddit user posted a detailed thread in r/Scams showing screenshots of phishing emails that look like they came straight from PayPal\u2019s official address.",
      "Phishing email sent from\u00a0service@paypal.com (Reddit)",
      "In a newer and more sophisticated twist, scammers are removing links altogether. Instead, they include a phone number and ask you to call. Once you do, you\u2019re connected with a fake PayPal representative who says they need to verify your identity. They then instruct you to download what appears to be a PayPal-branded support tool, but really it\u2019s a customized remote access app hosted on a different server. And once it\u2019s installed, it gives the scammer full access to your device.",

      "NEW PHISHING SCAM OUTSMARTS SECURITY CODES TO STEAL YOUR INFO",
      "How scammers are hijacking PayPal\u2019s system to send fake alerts",
      "This part is still a bit of a mystery. With typical PayPal invoice scams, content is tightly controlled, which means you normally can\u2019t change the email structure or messaging. However, these new emails suggest that scammers may be exploiting internal features, like business tools or API fields, to sneak custom content into PayPal-generated alerts. It\u2019s not just phishing, it\u2019s weaponizing a legitimate system to create trust and evade detection.",
      "Why this PayPal phishing attack is so dangerous",
      "This scam is especially effective and dangerous because the emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s official servers, making it difficult to distinguish them from legitimate messages. Since the sender address and branding are authentic, recipients are more likely to trust the communication without suspicion.",
      "The scammers also use urgent language that creates a sense of panic, such as warnings about unauthorized activity or large charges. This pressure encourages people to act quickly and often before fully considering whether the alert is genuine.",
      "Additionally, the scam often involves follow-up contact through calls or texts from individuals posing as PayPal personnel, further exploiting the initial confusion and increasing the chances of victims giving up sensitive information.",

      "4. Check your account manually: If you\u2019re ever in doubt, just log into your PayPal account directly. Review\u00a0recent activity and see if anything looks off. There is no need to rely on alerts alone.",
      "5. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward suspicious PayPal messages to phishing@paypal.com. You can also\u00a0report phishing attempts to the FTC.",
      "6. Use a personal data removal service: Since phishing scams like the recent PayPal scam often target personal information that scammers gather from data brokers and people search sites, using a reputable data removal service can help reduce your exposure.

Scammers exploit PayPal\u2019s built-in features to send real notifications that look legitimate. What makes it especially sneaky is the absence of links, Instead, these emails include a phone number, making them more likely to pass through spam filters. When you call, you\u2019re connected to a fake PayPal rep who pressures you into downloading a remote access tool disguised as support software. The safest move? Don\u2019t click, don\u2019t call.

There's a lot of hope that new designs, like small modular reactors, could make things faster and cheaper, but those technologies haven't been proven at scale just yet.",

      "A person trying a Tesla vehicle. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Elon Musk Tesla Facebook scam works",
      "This type of scam often begins after someone posts about Musk, Tesla or cryptocurrency. Scammers monitor public Facebook activity, then send a friend request from an account using Musk\u2019s name and photo. The profile may look legitimate, with copied images, reposted news articles or AI-generated content.",
      "Once the request is accepted, the impersonator encourages the victim to continue the conversation on WhatsApp. From there, the scam unfolds in a way that feels casual but calculated. The victim is congratulated on being randomly selected to win a brand-new Tesla and a large cash prize, often around $250,000. But before the reward can be delivered, they are told to cover \"delivery fees\" using an Apple Gift Card.",
      "In the case of the woman from Jensen Beach, she sent multiple gift cards totaling $800 before realizing the story was a setup. After claiming that a delivery truck had broken down, the scammer requested even more money. That's when she recognized the pattern and blocked the account.

      "Apple Gift Cards are frequently used because they are easy to find in stores and can be used for high-value digital purchases. But scammers also use Google Play, Amazon, Steam and Visa prepaid cards, depending on what they think the victim can access. These requests usually come with urgency. Victims may be told to stay on the phone while buying the cards or to scratch off the back and send a photo of the code right away. That sense of pressure is designed to override second thoughts. If anyone you do not know asks for payment in gift cards, it is a scam. No legitimate organization or contest will ever ask for them as payment or verification.",

Once they have your attention, they use that trust to steal money or personal information. Musk is one of the most frequently impersonated figures in scam campaigns. His name is widely associated with innovation, crypto and high-value giveaways, which makes him a perfect target for fraudsters trying to appear legitimate.

      "What ties these scams together is the use of a familiar face to lower suspicion. The scammer may use deepfake video, AI-generated voice clips or doctored screenshots to make the offer feel more real. Once the target engages, the pressure begins. Victims are asked to send money, act quickly and avoid telling anyone.

      "1. Never send gift card codes to anyone you do not know: If someone asks for Apple, Amazon or Google Play cards as payment or verification, it is a scam. No real prize, agency or company will request gift cards.",
      "2. Be skeptical of prize claims from celebrity accounts: Musk is not messaging people on Facebook to give away Teslas or cash. If the profile is unverified or the offer feels random, trust your instincts and ignore it.",
      "3. Do not move conversations to private apps like WhatsApp or Telegram: Scammers often push for this because these platforms have fewer safeguards, no public comment threads and limited reporting tools. Once the chat moves off Facebook, it becomes much harder to verify or report what\u2019s happening. If someone you do not know insists on switching platforms, it\u2019s usually a sign they are hiding something.",
      "4. Consider using a data removal service: If a scammer has targeted you or impersonated you online, chances are your personal information is floating around on data broker websites. These sites collect and sell everything from your home address to your family members\u2019 names, making you a bigger target for future scams. Data removal services can help you scan the web and request the deletion of your info from these brokers. While you can do this manually, it\u2019s time-consuming. Services like\u00a0Incogni offer subscriptions that automate the process and monitor for new exposures. If you\u2019ve been scammed or suspect your information was leaked, using a data removal service adds another layer of protection and peace of mind.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "5. Watch for common red flags: Be cautious of sudden friend requests from unfamiliar accounts, vague messages that mention surprise winnings, poor grammar or any pressure to act quickly. Scammers often use emotional triggers to override your judgment. If something feels off or too convenient, it probably is.",
      "6. Install strong antivirus software on all devices: Some impersonation scams include links to phishing pages or malware. Antivirus tools can block these threats before they reach your inbox. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7. Use two-factor authentication and a password manager: If a scam compromises your login credentials,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) can block unauthorized access. A password manager also helps protect against reused or weak passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "8. Report the scam right away: Use\u00a0Facebook\u2019s reporting tools to flag fake profiles or messages. You can also file a complaint with the FTC at\u00a0ReportFraud.ftc.gov to help warn others.",

      "And if you want proof of how poorly your data is treated, a newly uncovered database offers a stark reminder.

      "Cybernews describes the exposed database as a \"blueprint for mass exploitation.\" The records include login credentials from popular platforms like Google, Facebook and Apple.",
      "Security researchers emphasize that this isn't the result of a new, single breach. Instead, it's a massive collection of previously stolen credentials from various past leaks, phishing scams and third-party data exposures, some of which were forgotten, underreported or reshared.",
      "BleepingComputer, a cybersecurity site that reviewed the archive, confirmed the data appears to be aggregated from older breaches rather than a fresh incident. This makes the scope of the exposure particularly dangerous because attackers can use this central trove for targeted attacks, including credential stuffing.",
      "Credential stuffing becomes much easier when attackers have access to such a vast pool of usernames and passwords. This technique involves using stolen login details across multiple sites, exploiting the fact that many users reuse the same credentials. So, even if your account wasn't part of a recent breach, you could still be at risk if your old credentials are part of this newly indexed compilation.",

      "1. Use a password manager: Infostealer malware often targets passwords saved directly in web browsers, making them easy targets. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager that offers zero-knowledge architecture and military-grade encryption to keep your data safe. The best options work across all your devices and browsers, offer secure sharing, monitor for data breaches, and even generate health reports on your passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking, and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails, and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats, or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0 Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: The massive leak of 16 billion credentials shows just how far your personal information can spread and how easily it can resurface years later in aggregated hacker databases. Even if your passwords were part of an old breach, data like your name, email, phone number, or address may still be available through data broker sites. Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure by scrubbing this information from hundreds of these sites. While no service can guarantee total removal, they drastically reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to cross-reference leaked credentials with public data to impersonate or target you. These services monitor and automatically remove your personal info over time, which gives me peace of mind in today\u2019s threat landscape.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

This approach ensures there are no emissions, so the robot does not contribute to greenhouse gases or other forms of pollution. Unlike traditional gas-powered beach-cleaning equipment such as tractors, BeBot is quiet and unobtrusive, which allows it to work at any time without disturbing wildlife or beach visitors. Its cleaning capacity is impressive. BeBot can cover up to 32,200 square feet of beach in a single hour, which is 20 to 30 times more effective than manual trash collection. The robot can remove up to 200 pounds of debris in one session, targeting items like plastic bottles, cigarette butts, food packaging, and cotton buds. BeBot's design allows it to dig up to about four inches into the sand, and its sifting grids, which measure roughly half an inch by half an inch, capture even the smallest pieces of plastic and trash that would be difficult for people to collect by hand.",
      "Remote operation is another standout feature. BeBot can be controlled from up to 950 feet away, giving operators the flexibility to clean large or crowded beaches safely. Its unique track system distributes pressure evenly across the sand, which helps prevent beach erosion and protects sensitive habitats such as turtle nesting sites. The robot's battery can last up to three hours on a full charge, and some models can run for as long as eight hours.",

Millions of tons of plastic enter the oceans each year, harming hundreds of species, including nearly half of all marine animals. BeBot's gentle cleaning process reduces these threats without disturbing sensitive habitats or compressing turtle eggs. Cleaner beaches lead to healthier ecosystems and better experiences for visitors. Because BeBot operates quietly and efficiently, it is ideal for popular tourist destinations where traditional machinery would be disruptive or damaging. The robot also sparks important conversations about pollution and inspires communities to take action, complementing human-led cleanups by targeting the small plastics that often go unnoticed.",

    "story": [
      "Hackers are using Captchas to infect your PC with malware",
      "ClickFix, a social engineering tactic that has been targeting both Windows and Mac users since early 2024, continues to evolve.",
      "Just last month, I reported on how attackers were using fake CAPTCHA prompts to\u00a0trick Windows users into installing malware themselves.",
      "Now, that same trick is being turned against macOS. Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new campaign using ClickFix to deliver Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), a powerful information-stealing malware targeting Apple systems.",
      "SPOT FAKE ONLINE STORES, AVOID FACEBOOK SUBSCRIPTION SCAMS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ClickFix malware, and how does it work?",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0CloudSEK have identified a new threat targeting macOS users through imitation and deception. The campaign uses a technique known as ClickFix to lure victims through fake online verification prompts. This time, attackers are spoofing Spectrum, a major telecom provider in the United States. They use fraudulent domains that closely resemble Spectrum\u2019s real support portals. These include misleading addresses like panel spectrum net and spectrum ticket net.",
      "Visitors to these sites are shown a standard-looking CAPTCHA box, asking them to verify their identity. When they do, the site displays a fake error message that says the CAPTCHA failed. Users are encouraged to click a button labeled \"Alternative Verification.\" This triggers a command to be copied silently to their clipboard. What happens next depends on the user\u2019s operating system. On macOS, instructions guide the user to paste and run the command in Terminal. That command is actually a shell script designed to steal information and download malware.",
      "The script is particularly dangerous because it uses legitimate macOS system commands. It asks for the system password, harvests credentials and disables security protections. It then downloads AMOS. This is a known information stealer with a history of targeting Apple devices. The malware collects sensitive data like passwords, cryptocurrency wallet keys, browser autofill data and saved cookies.",
      "Researchers believe the campaign was created by Russian-speaking attackers. Clues include comments written in Russian found within the malware\u2019s code. Analysts also noted that the delivery infrastructure was poorly assembled. Mismatched instructions appeared across devices. For example, Linux users were shown Windows commands. Mac users were told to press keys that only exist on Windows machines.",

      "Fake Captcha on a Mac. (CloudSEK)",
      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Why ClickFix attacks are so effective",
      "ClickFix is a social engineering method that has rapidly gained popularity among cybercriminals. It relies on users trusting what they see and blindly following simple instructions. In this campaign, the attacker\u2019s goal is to make the victim execute the infection process themselves. Once the user follows through, the system is compromised without needing a traditional exploit.",
      "Researchers believe ClickFix has been active since at least March 2024. I first reported on it in June 2024, when\u00a0attackers used fake error messages from Google Chrome, Microsoft Word and OneDrive to push their payloads. Victims were shown prompts offering a \"fix,\" which copied a malicious PowerShell command to their clipboard. They were then instructed to paste and run it in PowerShell or through the Run dialog.",
      "By November 2024, the method had evolved further. A\u00a0new wave of attacks targeted Google Meet users, beginning with phishing emails that mimicked internal meeting invites.

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of ClickFix malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures:",
      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks also start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser, and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email, or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets, or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

The attack didn't just exploit a vulnerability in macOS, but also your familiarity with verification flows. As long as security instructions look like part of the usual experience, people will continue to run malicious code themselves. Mac users, like everyone else, need to treat every familiar-looking interface with a little more skepticism. Especially when it asks for your password.",

As supply chains face growing pressure and the driver shortage deepens across the U.S. and Europe, Plus Automation is stepping up with bold ambitions and powerful AI.",

The combined company will operate as PlusAI, which describes itself as a Physical AI company commercializing AI-based virtual driver software for autonomous trucks.",

      "Why Plus is grabbing attention in the trucking world",
      "Trucking is a $2 trillion freight market in the U.S. and Europe alone, and it faces some serious headwinds. There is a growing shortage of drivers, rising costs, and relentless demand for faster deliveries. Plus's SuperDrive software is designed to address these pain points by enabling safe, scalable autonomous trucking. The technology is not just theoretical. It has already been tested over five million miles across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, gathering real-world data to make its AI smarter and more reliable with every trip.",
      "Founded in Silicon Valley in 2016 by engineers and entrepreneurs with deep roots in AI and machine learning, Plus has always aimed to do things differently. Instead of relying on hand-coded rules, Plus uses advanced AI models to create a \"driving intelligence\" that learns and adapts from every mile on the road. This AV 2.0 approach helped Plus achieve a major safety milestone in April 2025, when its SuperDrive system successfully completed \"driver-out\" validation. The truck operated autonomously without a human behind the wheel. Plus is currently running public road tests in Texas and Sweden, with more fleet trials coming soon.",

      "One of Plus's biggest strengths is its deep integration with top truck manufacturers, including TRATON GROUP, Hyundai, and IVECO. These companies are working closely with Plus to factory-build, validate, and support autonomous trucks powered by SuperDrive. This OEM-led strategy means that fleet operators will receive autonomous trucks ready for the road, complete with support from trusted manufacturers.",
      "Plus is not working in isolation. The company has formed strategic collaborations with industry leaders like DSV, Bosch, and NVIDIA. These partnerships are designed to accelerate the rollout of autonomous capabilities and ensure that the technology is robust, reliable, and ready for real-world deployment. By working together, they are building an ecosystem that supports fleet operators every step of the way.",

      "The upcoming merger with Churchill Capital Corp IX is expected to provide Plus with up to $300 million in gross proceeds. This capital will help fund the commercial launch of SuperDrive-enabled, factory-built autonomous trucks in 2027. Plus is entering the public market with a pre-money valuation of $1.2 billion, offering an attractive opportunity for investors interested in the next wave of AI-driven logistics.",
      "What sets Plus apart financially is its capital-light, software-focused model. Instead of building trucks from scratch, Plus provides the AI \"brain\" that powers them, generating recurring revenue through a driver-as-a-service approach. This means high margins, scalable growth, and a clear path to profitability. The company is led by a team of experienced founders and executives, including CEO David Liu, who has a proven track record of building and scaling technology startups. Liu underscores the company\u2019s broader mission, stating:",

      "The numbers tell a compelling story. The U.S. and Europe together face a shortage of over 300,000 truck drivers every year, and that gap is only expected to widen as the workforce ages. Autonomous trucks offer a real solution by reducing operating costs, increasing truck utilization, and helping fleet operators keep up with demand.

      "While Plus Automation's vision is ambitious, it is not without critics. The autonomous trucking industry continues to face scrutiny from regulators, labor unions, and some logistics professionals who question whether the technology is truly ready for wide-scale deployment.",
      "Regulatory uncertainty remains one of the biggest obstacles. Fully autonomous, driver-out operations like\u00a0Plus is testing raise complex questions about safety, liability, and insurance. Many policymakers are cautious, arguing that current oversight and laws have not yet adapted to the fast-moving landscape of vehicle automation.",
      "Labor organizations, particularly the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, have voiced strong opposition. They warn that the widespread adoption of autonomous trucks could displace tens of thousands of human drivers and impact job security across the freight industry. These groups are pushing for more transparency, safety assurances, and legal protections for workers as automation expands. In a public statement opposing the rapid rollout of autonomous trucks, Sean M. O'Brien, General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said this:",
      "\"We are not going to sit back and watch as automation threatens the livelihood of millions of truck drivers across America.\"",
      "This quote underscores the growing tension between innovation and labor rights. For many in the workforce, autonomous trucking is seen less as a technological leap forward and more as a potential disruption to long-standing jobs and livelihoods.",
      "Even within the logistics industry itself, some operators remain skeptical about the pace of adoption. Questions remain about how autonomous systems will handle unpredictable real-world conditions such as bad weather, complex intersections, and rural roadways where sensor performance can vary.",
      "In response, Plus emphasizes its phased approach to automation. Rather than replacing drivers overnight, the company positions its SuperDrive system as a way to augment human capabilities, improve safety, and reduce fatigue. Its deep partnerships with trusted manufacturers and logistics providers are also aimed at easing the transition and building confidence across the industry.",
      "As Plus prepares to go public, how it addresses these concerns from regulators, workers, and industry stakeholders will be critical. Earning trust may prove just as important as advancing the technology itself.",

      "According to Linda Garner-Bunch, managing editor of The\u00a0Trucker Media Group:",
      "\"The idea of developing viable \u2014 and safe \u2014 autonomous Class 8 trucks has been around since the 1990s, with lots of tech firms tossing their hats in the ring. Many of those firms have failed, often because of a lack of funding. In addition, both the general public and the trucking industry have expressed concerns about the safety of current autonomous technology. After all, an 80,000-pound driverless truck can do a lot more damage than a 6,000-pound passenger car if something goes wrong!",
      "To address this, legislation has been introduced requiring that a qualified human operator be present in autonomous heavy-duty trucks to take over manual control as needed. Even so, autonomous tech is becoming increasingly common in both commercial and private vehicles \u2014 think anti-lock brakes, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane assist, camera systems \u2026 the list goes on and on.",
      "Autonomy may be the future of the trucking industry, but it\u2019s not ready for full deployment at this time. Adequate funding is needed to ensure that the development and testing of autonomous technology is done properly and safely. The merger between Plus and Churchill Capital Corp IX will help ensure the company has the necessary capital to conduct research, development, and testing while ensuring the safety of everyone on the road.\"",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Autonomous trucking might still sound futuristic to some, but companies like Plus Automation are proving it's already becoming a reality. With real-world testing, major industry partnerships, and a smart approach to scaling, Plus is putting itself in a strong position to lead this next chapter in logistics. That said, the journey won't be without its challenges. From regulatory roadblocks to concerns about the impact on jobs, there's still a lot to figure out. But if Plus can keep building trust and showing that its tech really does make trucking safer and more efficient, it could help reshape how freight moves across the U.S. and beyond.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Digital spoke with APCO International Executive Director and CEO Mel Maier on the need to invest in Next Generation 911.",
      "As lawmakers push forward with the sweeping One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the executive director and CEO of the oldest and largest organization of public safety communications professionals warns that its failure to include funding for Next Generation 911 (NG911) is a serious national security oversight with consequences for public safety.",
      "\"This bill does many good things,\" Mel Maier, executive director and CEO of APCO International, told Fox News Digital. \"However, it leaves something out that\u2019s very important, and that\u2019s funding for Next Generation 911 and failing to modernize that first call for help.\"",
      "NG911, Maier explained, is not just a modernization project but a public safety and national security necessity as the public remains on high alert following the U.S. strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities.",

      "He emphasized that NG911 is also a matter of national security, especially considering escalating global instability and the increasing threat of foreign cyberattacks.",
      "\"Next Generation 911, at its heart, is really about national security,\" Maier said. \"Whether it's cybersecurity from national threat actors, or from internal actors, we need to get that information to the field-based responders out there as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Pointing to the recent concerns about sleeper cells in the U.S., Maier said that the vulnerabilities that the current system has could easily be jeopardized.",
      "\"We know that cyberterrorists and threats are being directed against 911 today, and it\u2019s affecting us today,\" he said. \"Ransomware attacks have taken down 911 centers, police departments, fire departments, EMS agencies across the U.S. We need to stop that.\"",
      "Despite these warnings, NG911 funding was not included in the current \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"We do believe that working with Congress in a bicameral and bipartisan way is the only effective way to make this happen,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve had assurances from Congress on both sides of the aisle that this is a national priority.\"",
      "WATCH: US has \u2018eyes open\u2019 for possible Iranian cyberattacks, says tech expert",
      "APCO supports legislation introduced by Sen. Amy Klobuchar that contains language crafted in collaboration with public safety experts, but Maier pointed out that the bill still lacks what matters most: a funding source.",
      "\"That bill in Sen. [Amy] Klobuchar\u2019s office right now has foundational and fundamental language that we support,\" he said. \"Public safety has supported it. We\u2019ve helped craft that language. However, it does not identify a funding source. That\u2019s missing. Without it, it will not move forward.\"",
      "American flags hang from the front porch of a row of North Carolina homes. (iStock)",
      "Funding remains a weak spot in the organization\u2019s effort to modernize 911. A federal cost analysis from 2018 estimated that a full nationwide rollout of NG911 would require $15 billion. Without this investment, Maier warned, the U.S. risks a fragmented emergency response system and what he calls \"a nation of haves and have-nots.\"",
      "\"Some states have invested in Next Generation 911 infrastructure and technologies. Others have done nothing,\" Maier said. \"That leaves us with haves and have-nots across the nation. We want to have cities, communities, townships, villages, rural areas, tribal areas, territories all getting the same services. It should be across the nation, the same for everyone.\"",
      "AMERICANS WEIGH IN ON TRUMP'S \u2018BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL\u2019: POLLS",
      "The current system still runs on infrastructure built in the 1960s and '70s, which was never designed to support video, multimedia messaging, or geolocation data.",
      "\"Next Generation 911 allows that information to reach the 911 center, and then it can be pushed out to those field-based responders,\" Maier said. \"That information itself can be critical in getting the best information to the right person quickly enough that they can make a difference and save lives. Next Generation 911, if implemented nationwide today, will save lives today.\"",

    "story": [
      "Senate Republicans on Tuesday passed changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT, as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s multitrillion-dollar spending bill.",
      "Passed via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, of 2017, there\u2019s a $10,000 limit on the SALT deduction through 2025, which has been a pain point for certain lawmakers in high-tax blue states.",
      "If enacted, the Senate bill would lift the cap to $40,000 starting in 2025, with the phaseout starting over $500,000 of income. Both figures would increase by 1% yearly through 2029 and the $40,000 limit would revert to $10,000 in 2030.",
      "By contrast, the House-approved measure under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would offer the higher limit for a longer window. The $40,000 cap would begin in 2025, with the same $500,000 income phaseout, and both figures would rise by 1% annually from 2026 through 2033.",
      "The Senate\u2019s legislation still needs House approval before the final bill can be delivered to Trump\u2019s desk. It was unclear Tuesday whether moderate House Republicans would accept the Senate\u2019s proposed SALT deduction changes.",
      "Before TCJA, the SALT deduction was unlimited for taxpayers who itemized deductions. But the so-called alternative minimum tax reduced the benefit for some higher earners.",
      "While the higher SALT cap lasts longer under the House bill, SALT relief is two-thirds larger in the Senate bill when including alternative minimum tax changes, according to a Saturday analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",
      "Both bills also reduce itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could lower the benefit of the higher SALT cap. This reduction is bigger in the House bill.",
      "How the SALT deduction works",
      "When filing taxes, you pick the greater of the standard deduction or your itemized deductions, including SALT capped at $10,000, medical expenses above 7.5% of your adjusted gross income, charitable gifts and others.",
      "Starting in 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the standard deduction, and it adjusts for inflation yearly. For 2025, the standard deduction is $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for married couples filing jointly. These could increase under the Senate-proposed tax bill.",
      "Under the current thresholds, the vast majority of filers \u2014 roughly 90%, according to the latest IRS data \u2014 use the standard deduction and don\u2019t benefit from itemized tax breaks.",
      "Who benefits from the higher SALT cap",
      "Raising the SALT deduction cap would primarily benefit higher earners, according to a May analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "The Senate legislation would also protect a SALT cap workaround for pass-through businesses, which allows owners to sidestep the $10,000 cap. By contrast, the House-approved bill would have ended the strategy for certain white-collar professionals.",
      "\u201cThis SALT \u2018deal\u2019 in the latest Senate bill is a nonsensical approach to tax policy,\u201d Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of the Tax Law Center at New York University School of Law, wrote in a post on X on Saturday.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Tucked inside massive domestic policy bill that Senate Republicans released over the weekend was an excise tax for wind and solar projects. The provision came as a surprise not just to the renewable energy industry, but also to numerous senators crafting the legislation.",
      "In a twist, Republican senators insist they didn't know how or why the tax was inserted into the bill they were rushing to pass. No senator took credit for \u2014 or defended \u2014 it.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the Budget Committee chairman, who released the 940-page bill, said he was unsure of where that provision came from.",
      "\"It's a secret, I guess,\" Graham told NBC News on Monday evening. \"I don't know where it came from.\"",

      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, was baffled by its initial inclusion, saying the excise tax \"just came about\" like it was \"airdropped\" into the bill before a vote Saturday to advance the legislation.",
      "\"It wasn\u2019t part of any consideration,\" she said. \"It\u2019s like, surprise! It\u2019s Saturday night. And we looked at it like, where did this come from?\"",
      "\"My view of it is \u2014 it\u2019s just entirely punitive to the wind and solar industry,\" Murkowski said, adding that the Republican-controlled Senate was \"looking at different options\" to deal with it.",
      "The provision would have taxed wind and solar projects if a certain share of their components come from China. It is ambiguously worded, and it would empower the Trump administration to iron out the rule.",
      "Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said she was \"OK with that\" when she was asked about the details of the provision. But she, too, was in the dark about who inserted it.",
      "\"You can add me to the group that doesn't know the answer,\" Lummis said.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the former Trump adviser, torched the legislation, saying it would \"destroy millions of jobs in America.\"",

      "Spokespeople for the Republican chairs of the Finance Committee (Mike Crapo of Idaho), the Energy and Natural Resources Committee (Mike Lee of Utah) and the Environment and Public Works Committee (Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia) didn't respond to requests for comment when they were asked whether the senators had championed the provision.",

      "The Federal Reserve would have cut interest rates by now if President Donald Trump's tariffs weren't so substantial, central bank chief Jerome Powell said Tuesday.",
      "Trump\u2019s ever-changing tariff agenda has caused months of deep uncertainty for global markets and businesses. Many have struggled to make predictions and plan ahead for duties that have shifted, sometimes with no warning other than social media posts by the president.",
      "\u201cChair, would the Fed have cut [rates] more by now if it weren\u2019t for the tariffs?\u201d Bloomberg News anchor Francine Lacqua asked Powell at the European Central Bank\u2019s annual forum in Sintra, Portugal.",
      "\u201cSo I do think that\u2019s right,\u201d Powell responded. \u201cIn effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs. We didn\u2019t overreact. In fact we didn\u2019t react at all, we\u2019re simply taking some time.\u201d",
      "The Fed chair's comments underscored a stance he has stuck to despite unrelenting, norm-shattering attacks by Trump and his top allies urging the central bank to lower interest rates. The pressure campaign has led Powell to repeatedly defend the central bank's independence from political influence \u2014 a position the Supreme Court appeared to bolster in a ruling last month \u2014 along with the decision to hold rates steady.",
      "\u201cAs long as the U.S. economy is in solid shape, the prudent thing to do is to wait and learn more and see what the effect might be,\u201d Powell said Tuesday. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen effects much from tariffs, and we didn\u2019t expect to by now. We have always said the timing, amount and persistence would be highly uncertain.\u201d He added that the import taxes' ultimate impact on the economy could wind up being either greater or less than currently anticipated.",
      "Powell declined to weigh in on the likelihood of a July rate cut, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s going to depend on the data.\u201d",
      "Trump renewed his rebukes of the central bank chief Tuesday, telling reporters in Florida that \u201canybody\u201d would be better atop the Fed. He bashed Powell again hours later, saying aboard Air Force One: \"We have a moron at the head of the Fed. He's a moron.\"",
      "Asked about the impact of Trump's insult-laden criticism, Powell said, \u201cI\u2019m very focused on just doing my job.\u201d He said the only two things that matter to him and fellow rate-setting officials are full employment and price stability \u2014 the two sides of the Fed's so-called \u201cdual mandate.\u201d The ECB conference attendees applauded his response.",
      "Trump has expanded his attacks on Powell to include the committee that sets interest rates, saying Monday that its members should be \u201cashamed\u201d of current monetary policy. \u201cThe Board just sits there and watches, so they are equally to blame. We should be paying 1% Interest, or better,\" Trump posted on social media.",
      "In fact, the Federal Open Market Committee members vote during each of their meetings on whether to adjust interest rates after spending a day deliberating. Afterward, many voting members often explain their rationale for supporting or opposing the committee's decision, including in speeches or written papers.",
      "Trump appointed Powell to lead the Fed during his first term in office. He also named two of its current board members, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller.",
      "Asked in Sintra how she would handle political pressure akin to what Powell faces, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said, \u201cI think we would do exactly the same thing as our colleague Jay Powell does.\u201d Other panelists, who included  governors of the central banks of Korea and Japan, said they agreed with Lagarde, drawing further applause.",
      "Last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said administration officials have discussed appointing the next Fed chair to the earliest board seat available. The term of Biden-appointee Adriana Kugler ends in January 2026, meaning \u201can October, November\u201d nomination, according to Bessent.",
      "Powell would not say Tuesday whether he planned to remain on the board of the Federal Reserve System after his term as chair ends in May 2026. He could remain as a board member until January 2028, if he chooses to.",
      "\u201cI want to hand over to my successor an economy in good shape,\u201d Powell said.",
      "CORRECTION (July 1, 2024, 1:40 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated when Powell's term ends as Fed chairman. It is in May 2026, not May 2025."

      "Progressive state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani has won New York City\u2019s Democratic mayoral primary, NBC News projects, marking a stunning rise by the 33-year-old democratic socialist over powerful former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.",
      "The projection comes as the New York City Board of Elections released the initial round of ranked-choice voting results, with Mamdani emerging as the top candidate.",
      "Mamdani won 56% of the vote after the initial ranked-choice tabulation narrowed the race to Mamdani and Cuomo, who won 44%. The initial tabulation includes ballots cast in person and mail ballots received and processed as of last week\u2019s primary Election Day. Voters could rank up to five candidates in order of preference, and the candidates with the lowest number of voters are eliminated first. Their votes are then reallocated to their supporters\u2019 next choice, and the process continues until two candidates remain.",
      "Mamdani's surprise victory over Cuomo, who had long been viewed as the front-runner, received attention far outside New York City, raising more questions for a Democratic Party establishment that is struggling with its path forward after its 2024 losses.",
      "Mamdani\u2019s status as the Democratic nominee will no doubt be a boost in the heavily Democratic city, but he will have to face Mayor Eric Adams, who was elected as a Democrat but decided to run for re-election as an independent after Trump\u2019s Justice Department dropped corruption charges against him. Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa will also be on the fall ballot along with other candidates.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear whether Mamdani has defeated Cuomo for good. Cuomo will still be on the November ballot after forming his own political party, declining to remove his name by last week\u2019s deadline. But it remains to be seen if Cuomo will actively campaign as a third-party candidate.",
      "Cuomo campaign spokesman Rich Azzopardi said Monday that the campaign did not expect the ranked choice results to be \u201call that revelatory,\u201d given the results of primary voters\u2019 first choices released last week.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be examining the expected makeup and opinions of general electorate voters while determining next steps,\u201d Azzopardi said in a statement.",
      "Mamdani, though, is confident that he can beat both Adams and Cuomo in November.",
      "\u201cWe can beat anyone that\u2019s in this race because what we\u2019ve shown is that this is a campaign that has the support of more than 400,000 New Yorkers,\u201d Mamdani told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday, adding that the race will be a \u201creferendum\u201d on how Adams \u201cmade this city so unaffordable.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor too long, politicians have pretended to simply be bystanders to a cost of living crisis,\u201d Mamdani said. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually exacerbated it. And our vision is one that will respond to it and make this a city affordable for every New Yorker.\u201d",
      "Primary victory",
      "Running in the highest-profile race of his life, Mamdani took down Cuomo, a former governor who had been one of the most prominent Democrats in the country before his downfall in 2021, when he resigned amid sexual harassment allegations.",
      "Cuomo had asked Democratic voters for a second chance by framing himself as uniquely suited to run the city given his past executive experience and history pushing back on President Donald Trump. Backed by prominent Democrats and wealthy donors, Cuomo and his allies blanketed the city with ads and vastly outspent his rivals.",
      "But in the end, Mamdani emerged victorious, as Democrats signaled they\u2019re ready to move on to a fresh face promising a new, progressive direction for the city. Now, he could become the city\u2019s first Muslim mayor.",
      "Mamdani won his seat in the New York state Assembly in 2020, representing parts of Queens. Born in Uganda to Indian parents, Mamdani grew up primarily in the city as the son of an academic and a filmmaker, leaving the city to attend Bowdoin College in Maine before returning to Queens to work as a foreclosure prevention counselor. He became an American citizen in 2018 and narrowly defeated an incumbent Democratic legislator in his 2020 run for office, in which he was backed by the Democratic Socialists of America.",
      "Mamdani has embraced that democratic socialist moniker at a time where Democratic Party faces an identity crisis across the country. His campaign has been centered on a call to \u201cput working people first\u201d and provide a new direction for the city funded by tax increases on the wealthy.",
      "Mamdani has drawn the ire of Republicans, including Trump, who wrote in a Truth Social post that Democrats \u201ccrossed the line\u201d to support Mamdani, who is \u201ca 100% Communist Lunatic,\u201d",
      "Mamdani told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Trump \u201cwants to distract from what I\u2019m fighting for. And I\u2019m fighting for the very working people that he ran a campaign to empower, that he has since then betrayed.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd when we talk about my politics, I call myself a democratic socialist in many ways inspired by the words of Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] from decades ago who said, \u2018Call it democracy or call it democratic socialism. There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God\u2019s children in this country,\u2019\u201d Mamdani said.",
      "Mamdani drew significant blowback from Cuomo and prominent Jewish leaders during the primary for not denouncing the slogan \u201cglobalize the intifada\u201d when asked about it during a podcast interview. Mamdani referred to the slogan as \u201ca desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights,\u201d and added that the U.S. Holocaust Museum had used the Arabic word \u201cintifada\u201d in a translated description of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against Nazi Germany.",
      "The museum, as well as a handful of Jewish leaders, criticized those comments and accused Mamdani of stoking antisemitism, while Cuomo and his allies pointed to the episode to claim Mamdani shouldn\u2019t be elected to lead a city with a sizable Jewish population.",
      "Asked why he would not condemn the slogan, Mamdani told \"Meet the Press\": \u201cMy concern is to start to walk down the line of language and making clear what language I believe is permissible or impermissible takes me into a place similar to that of the president, who is looking to do those very kinds of things \u2014 putting people in jail for writing an op-ed, putting them in jail for protesting.\u201d",
      "\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s not language that I use,\u201d Mamdani said. \u201cIt\u2019s language I understand there are concerns about. And what I will do is showcase my vision for this city through my words and my actions.\u201d"

      "Pioneering televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, one of the first preachers to bring his ministry to a massive TV audience before being embroiled in a damaging sex scandal, died in Louisiana following a two-week hospitalization, a family representative said Tuesday.",
      "He was 90.",
      "\"Today, our hearts are heavy as we share that Brother Swaggart has finished his earthly race and entered into the presence of His Savior, Jesus Christ,\" according to a statement posted on his Facebook page.",
      "\"He met his beloved Savior and entered the portals of glory. At the same time, we rejoice knowing that we will see him again one day.\"",
      "Swaggart was taken to the hospital on June 15 after suffering cardiac arrest, his family said.",
      "The pastor's loved ones thanked the staff at Baton Rouge General Medical Center \"for their incredible support and care given during this time,\" the statement said.",
      "\"Rest in peace to Rev. Jimmy Swaggart,\" Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said in a statement. \"He devoted much of his life to bringing people to Christ. Our prayers go out to the Swaggart family during this difficult time.\"",
      "Swaggart became famous in 1975 when, according to his Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, \"his television crews were able to capture the services live and replay them on his weekly program.\"",
      "And by the mid-1980s, his Sunday show was aired on hundreds of TV stations across America.",
      "But his standing in the TV Christian community suffered a terrible blow when allegations emerged that he frequented a local prostitute.",
      "Swaggart famously gave a tearful 1988 sermon, telling the congregation he had \"sinned,\" though he didn't offer any specifics.",
      "\"I have sinned against you,\" Swaggart said. \"I beg you to forgive me.\"",
      "Jimmy Lee Swaggart was born March 15, 1935, in Ferriday, Louisiana, to W.L. and Minnie Bell Swaggart.",
      "The family was blessed with showmanship and musical talent, exemplified by Swaggart's TV acumen and the singing ability of his famed cousins Jerry Lee Lewis and Mickey Gilley.",
      "The pastor was comfortable spreading his Pentecostal message at a typewriter, behind a radio microphone and eventually in front of a TV camera.",
      "But with his microphone always metaphorically on, Swaggart was often caught making deeply divisive statements.",
      "He once described the Catholic Church as \"the whore of the Apocalypse\" and as a false religion.",
      "Misfortunes endured by Jewish people came \"because of their rejection of Christ,\" according to Swaggart.",
      "The TV preacher's flock didn't seem to mind those statements. Still, his career took a decided turn south when Swaggart was photographed leaving a Louisiana motel after spending time with a prostitute.",
      "Swaggart was eventually defrocked by the Assemblies of God.",
      "Swaggart is survived by his wife, Frances, son Donnie, daughter-in-law Debbie, grandson Gabriel, daughter Jill, granddaughter Jennifer, son-in-law Clif, son Matt, daughter-in-law Joanna and nine great-grandchildren \u2014 Sam, Ryder, Abby, Lola, Harper, Navy, Harrison, Caroline and Mackenzie."

      "The Utah mom facing charges for allegedly killing her husband and later publishing a children's book on how to cope with grief was indicted Friday in connection with a series of financial crimes related to his death.",
      "Kouri Richins, 34, was charged in connection with more than two dozen counts of mortgage fraud, forgery, issuing a bad check, money laundering, communications fraud, and a pattern of unlawful activity in the months before her husband, Eric Richins, 39, was poisoned in 2022.",
      "The new charges come more than two years after the mother of three was arrested and charged in connection with her husband's killing, which she pleaded not guilty to.",
      "According to the indictment, Richins used a power of attorney in 2019 to obtain a $250,000 home equity line of credit (HELOC) on a house her husband owned before they got married without his knowledge. She then allegedly invested the money in her real estate business.",
      "\"The secret origination and continued existence of the HELOC was a source of tension between the Defendant and Eric Richins,\" the indictment says. \"The Defendant informed Eric Richins that she would repay the loan and led Eric Richins to believe that she had repaid it. The HELOC was not paid off on the day of Eric Richins\u2019 death.\"",
      "Eric Richins then allegedly consulted an estate planning lawyer in 2020 to \"protect himself in the short-term from recently discovered and ongoing abuse and misuse of his finances by the Defendants, and to protect his three children in the long-term by ensuring that the Defendant would never be able to manage his property after his death,\" the indictment alleges.",
      "Richins is also accused of stealing more than $100,000 from her husband's business and spending tens of thousands of dollars on his credit cards, the indictment says.",
      "Kouri Richins\u2019 lawyers, Kathy Nester and Wendy Lewis, said the new charges were \"extremely troubling.\"",
      "\"This sudden push to file new fraud charges over two years later underscores the weakness of the state\u2019s pending murder charges, since these fraud charges would not even come into play unless they fail to secure a conviction,\" the lawyers said in a statement.",
      "Kouri Richins\u2019 arrest gained national attention because she published a children\u2019s book titled \u201cAre You with Me?\u201d\u2014 which tells the story of a child whose dead father watches over him as an angel \u2014 and promoted the book on national television.",
      "Eric Richins was found unresponsive in the pair's Utah home \u2014 about 40 miles southeast of Salt Lake City \u2014 after having had a cocktail to celebrate his wife\u2019s business deal.",
      "Five times the lethal dose of \u201cillicit,\u201d non-medical-grade fentanyl was found in his system, according to the local medical examiner's office.",
      "His murder trial is scheduled to begin in February 2026."

      "Apple has accused a former engineer for its Vision Pro headset computer of stealing company trade secrets before starting a new job at Snap, according to a lawsuit filed in California last week.",
      "In the June 24 court filing, Apple accuses Di Liu, a senior design engineer, of downloading thousands of documents in his final days at the Cupertino company last year and saving them to his personal cloud accounts.",
      "This lawsuit is the latest example of Apple publicly going after a former employee for leaking internal information. Apple is an intensely secretive company, and lawsuits like this one highlight how the iPhone maker exercises tight control over its internal information, even if it has to pursue legal action against former staff.",
      "Apple alleges that Liu didn\u2019t inform the company when he resigned late last year that he was headed to Snap, a competitor and maker of smart glasses. As a result, Apple did not shut off his access to accounts and allowed him a customary two-week transition period, which he used to download company files, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWorse still, the review of Mr. Liu\u2019s Apple-issued work laptop also shows that while maintaining access to Apple\u2019s Proprietary Information under false pretenses, he used his Apple credentials to exfiltrate thousands of documents containing Proprietary Information from Apple\u2019s secure file storage systems,\u201d the iPhone maker\u2019s lawyers said in the filing.",
      "Many of the files downloaded by Liu had codenames for Apple projects and described the company\u2019s technology, product design and supply chain, according to the lawsuit. Apple says that all employees agree to keep Apple files confidential and that Liu broke confidentiality agreements he made when he joined. Liu worked for Apple between 2017 and 2024, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Liu worked on Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset as a system product design engineer, per the filing. Liu did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC.",
      "Apple lawyers wrote that Liu could use the trade secrets in his work at Snap. Apple is not suing Snap, and the social media company did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cThe overlap between Apple\u2019s Proprietary Information that Mr. Liu retained and Snap\u2019s AR products (for which Mr. Liu is a \u2018product design engineer\u2019) suggests that Mr. Liu intends to use Apple\u2019s Proprietary Information at Snap,\u201d according to the filing.",
      "Apple is seeking damages and for Liu to have his devices inspected by a forensic examiner to make sure all the trade secrets are deleted.",
      "The iPhone maker has sued several former employees in recent years for taking files when they left the company.",
      "Apple settled with former engineer Simon Lancaster in 2022 over providing information to a journalist. Apple also sued a former employee, Andrew Aude, in 2024 over leaking details to the media. That lawsuit was dismissed after Aude apologized.",
      "The Cupertino company sued Rivos, a chip startup staffed by former Apple semiconductor employees, over its intellectual property, and settled in 2024.",
      "Additionally at least three former Apple employees have also been arrested and accused by the government of taking company secrets and giving them to China-linked organizations. One pled guilty and was sentenced to four months in prison, and two are still in proceedings.",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/jewelry-sales-outperform-us-spending-luxury-goods-falters-citi-report-rcna216232",
    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 19:58:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Luxury retail was expected to stage a turnaround in 2025 after a promising fourth quarter marked by holiday shopping and post-election euphoria.",
    "story": [
      "Luxury retail was expected to stage a turnaround in 2025 after a promising fourth quarter marked by holiday shopping and post-election euphoria. Instead, U.S. credit card spending on luxury goods fell during the first five months of the year compared with the same period in 2024, according to data from Citigroup.",
      "For the month of May, luxury spending held up better than expected, dipping 1.7% year over year, compared with a 6.8% decline in April and 8.5% in March. Combined spend for the top luxury brands, such as Herm\u00e8s, even eked out a 0.2% uptick on an annual basis, according to Citi\u2019s analysis of a subset of transactions by the bank\u2019s 10 million-plus U.S. cardholders.",
      "However, these gains aren\u2019t equally distributed. Jewelry has proven to be a bright spot, consistently outperforming other categories like leather goods and ready-to-wear.",
      "Monthly spend on luxury jewelry has increased on an annual basis each month since September, according to Citi. In May, total luxury jewelry spend surged 10.1% year over year.",
      "What\u2019s more, while other categories were buoyed by increases in average spend by customer, jewelry was the only product type to also see an increase in individual customers. Within the jewelry category, however, a cohort of high-end brands lost 2.7% of customers, but those who remained spent 11.7% more on average.",
      "Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet told CNBC that sales have likely been buoyed by the perception of jewelry as investment pieces. Jewelry can also carry more sentimental value, he said, as a gift or to commemorate a life milestone.",
      "\u201cWhen you have $3,000 to spend on luxury, you know, are you going to buy a piece of jewelry or a handbag for the same price?\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps the piece of jewelry gives you superior intrinsic value given the precious metals content and superior emotional value and meaning.\u201d",
      "Chauvet added that the recent run-up in gold prices provides further justification.",
      "\u201cIt is probably sensible to buy a Cartier bracelet now, given they have increased prices by less than 5% since the beginning of 2025, when gold prices have appreciated by over 25%,\u201d he said.",
      "Handbag brands, on the other hand, have steadily increased prices as much as 30% to 40% since the pandemic without the consumer getting more bang for their buck, he said.",
      "\u201cHandbags have offered limited newness,\u201d Chauvet said, with the caveat that a few fall and winter 2025 collections showed some promise. \u201cIn the last five years, from brand A to brand B, most bags shapes and styles are very difficult to differentiate from one another.\u201d",
      "Luxury watch spending has seen some gains this year, but less consistently than that of jewelry. Across all luxury watch brands, spending increased 14.7% compared with May 2024. However, results for the top watch brands fell 10% in May on an annual basis.",
      "While surges in Swiss watch exports have made headlines, Chauvet said it was largely driven by retailers stocking up and watch manufacturers rushing product to U.S. subsidiaries in reaction to President Donald Trump\u2019s threatened 31% tariff on Swiss goods.",
      "The spending uptick in May may reflect an uplift in consumer sentiment but not necessarily a turning point for high-end shoppers, according to Chauvet. While equity markets have rebounded, the U.S. dollar is down about 10% year to date.",

    "story": [
      "Senate Republicans on Tuesday passed changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT, as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s multitrillion-dollar spending bill.",
      "Passed via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, of 2017, there\u2019s a $10,000 limit on the SALT deduction through 2025, which has been a pain point for certain lawmakers in high-tax blue states.",
      "If enacted, the Senate bill would lift the cap to $40,000 starting in 2025, with the phaseout starting over $500,000 of income. Both figures would increase by 1% yearly through 2029 and the $40,000 limit would revert to $10,000 in 2030.",
      "By contrast, the House-approved measure under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would offer the higher limit for a longer window. The $40,000 cap would begin in 2025, with the same $500,000 income phaseout, and both figures would rise by 1% annually from 2026 through 2033.",
      "The Senate\u2019s legislation still needs House approval before the final bill can be delivered to Trump\u2019s desk. It was unclear Tuesday whether moderate House Republicans would accept the Senate\u2019s proposed SALT deduction changes.",
      "Before TCJA, the SALT deduction was unlimited for taxpayers who itemized deductions. But the so-called alternative minimum tax reduced the benefit for some higher earners.",
      "While the higher SALT cap lasts longer under the House bill, SALT relief is two-thirds larger in the Senate bill when including alternative minimum tax changes, according to a Saturday analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",
      "Both bills also reduce itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could lower the benefit of the higher SALT cap. This reduction is bigger in the House bill.",
      "How the SALT deduction works",
      "When filing taxes, you pick the greater of the standard deduction or your itemized deductions, including SALT capped at $10,000, medical expenses above 7.5% of your adjusted gross income, charitable gifts and others.",
      "Starting in 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the standard deduction, and it adjusts for inflation yearly. For 2025, the standard deduction is $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for married couples filing jointly. These could increase under the Senate-proposed tax bill.",
      "Under the current thresholds, the vast majority of filers \u2014 roughly 90%, according to the latest IRS data \u2014 use the standard deduction and don\u2019t benefit from itemized tax breaks.",
      "Who benefits from the higher SALT cap",
      "Raising the SALT deduction cap would primarily benefit higher earners, according to a May analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "The Senate legislation would also protect a SALT cap workaround for pass-through businesses, which allows owners to sidestep the $10,000 cap. By contrast, the House-approved bill would have ended the strategy for certain white-collar professionals.",
      "\u201cThis SALT \u2018deal\u2019 in the latest Senate bill is a nonsensical approach to tax policy,\u201d Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of the Tax Law Center at New York University School of Law, wrote in a post on X on Saturday.",
      "\u201cIt preserves (and lessens) a limit on deductions for wealthy taxpayers while ignoring a loophole that allows the wealthiest of those taxpayers to avoid the limit entirely,\u201d she wrote.",

      "The young man said he\u2019s lived in fear ever since he developed an addiction to drugs and later fell prey to drug trafficking in Guanajuato, central Mexico. \u201cUnfortunately, they\u2019ve already killed my best friend and my relatives,\u201d said the 19-year-old, whose name is being withheld since he's afraid of reprisals.",
      "\u201cDrug addiction led me to a critical condition. I couldn\u2019t find a way out, and I was scared,\u201d he told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "A year ago, he managed to escape from a panic house (also known as panicueva, or panic cave) commonly used by organized crime gangs in Mexico. Some of these buildings, located in Guanajuato and other states where drug use is rampant, also serve as recruitment bases for young people selected to become hit men and operatives for these criminal groups.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the place where you can go, buy your drugs, and get high right there,\u201d said another 19-year-old who managed to escape a panic house and was interviewed by Noticias Telemundo on the condition that he remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.",
      "\"I entered a panic house and saw several women who had to prostitute themselves, and several of my friends got involved in selling drugs and ended up being killed,\u201d said the young man. He said he spent five years living in one of the houses and eventually joined a local gang.",
      "According to the latest report issued by the Mexican government, Guanajuato is the state with the highest number of homicides (980 from January to April). In February, the daily average reached 12.5. Last year, the Victimization and Security Perception Survey revealed that 87.5% of the population in Guanajuato considered public safety to be the most serious problem in the state.",
      "\"They've put a gun to my head, they\u2019ve threatened me, they\u2019ve told me I\u2019m done, that\u2019s it. But the most horrible thing I\u2019ve seen is how they killed my best friend,\u201d the young man said, referring to his experience in the shelters.",
      "\u201cI was required to do many things ... they send us to train to use a firearm, all of that comes together and from there come the hit men, from there come the thieves, the hawks,\u201d he said, referring to the murderers, thieves and drug traffickers.",
      "'They are recruiting more minors'",
      "Guanajuato is grappling with gang clashes over criminal activities such as fuel trafficking, and is also the epicenter of a growing methamphetamine epidemic. According to data from the Federal Ministry of Health, the addiction rate to this drug in the state grew 449% over the past 20 years.",
      "For David Miranda, a counselor at the Las Joyas de Le\u00f3n Addiction Assistance Center, a civil association, the rise in methamphetamine use is creating a social crisis in the state.",
      "\"They're recruiting more minors, ages 12 to 17,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cWithin these 'panic houses,' they recruit many minors who are now hit men.\u201d",
      "Noticias Telemundo visited the Las Joyas neighborhood in the municipality of Le\u00f3n, where, according to the state\u2019s Security Secretariat, criminal groups have taken over a 380-unit housing complex.",
      "\u201cThe situation in Le\u00f3n right now is demanding and very serious,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cInside those houses there are women, girls, minors, and you see drug trafficking, trafficking of women, trafficking of everything.\"",
      "Most panic houses are in working-class neighborhoods like Las Joyas. According to the state government, there could be up to 60,000 homes across Guanajuato currently being used for illegal drug use.",
      "\u201cIn fact, you can see a panic house on any corner, anywhere. It\u2019s very easy to find them. There are many abandoned houses,\u201d one of the young men interviewed by Noticias Telemundo said.",
      "'I don\u2019t want to be caught again'",
      "According to state figures, at least 10 people have been murdered in panic houses in the last two years, and around 400 neighborhoods in the state are struggling with high crime rates.",
      "\u201cLe\u00f3n is the number one city in terms of drug dealing,\u201d said Juan Mauro Gonz\u00e1lez, Guanajuato\u2019s secretary of security.",
      "\"Drug houses\" aren\u2019t unique to Mexico; similar trends exist in other countries, such as drug houses in the United States or drug dens in Spain. \u201cWhile criminals may be attracted to abandoned houses, these are also spaces where potential victims and criminals tend to converge without surveillance. Our results support the idea that abandoned houses also generate crime,\u201d said Lauren C. Porter, a professor at the University of Maryland who co-wrote a study on the issue.",
      "\"The most important thing to rehabilitate people is to change their mindset. They have to say they don\u2019t want that anymore, that they no longer want to suffer or be in that world where they were humiliated, abused, and forced to do things. They should want a different life; we do the rest and we help them,\u201d said Miranda, who said his addiction center has a capacity to serve 150 people.",
      "Meanwhile, young people like the ones interviewed by Noticias Telemundo continue to struggle to avoid falling back into addiction and the dangers of the \"haunted houses\" that abound on some areas of Guanajuato.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t want them to catch me again and force me to do things,\u201d said one of the men, who told Noticias Telemundo he wants to move to another neighborhood and have an honest job as a pizza maker, as he enjoys feeding people.",
      "\u201cMy life is already very ruined, I was very humiliated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to make a change.\u201d",

      "U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose granted the preliminary injunction sought by a coalition of attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit filed in early May.",
      "DuBose said the states had shown \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d from the cuts and were likely to prevail in their claims that \u201cHHS\u2019s action was both arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe executive branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,\u201d DuBose wrote in a 58-page order handed down in U.S. district court in Providence.",
      "Her order blocks the Trump administration from finalizing layoffs announced in March or issuing any further firings. HHS is directed to file a status report by July 11.",

Since then, agencies including the CDC have repeatedly rescinded layoffs affecting hundreds of employees, including in branches that monitor HIV, hepatitis and other diseases.",
      "The attorneys general argued that the massive restructuring was arbitrary and outside of the scope of the agency\u2019s authority. The lawsuit also says the action decimated essential programs and pushed burdensome costs onto states.",
      "\u201cThe intended effect \u2026 was the wholesale elimination of many HHS programs that are critical to public health and safety,\u201d the lawsuit argued.",

      "But the restructuring had eliminated key teams that regulate food safety and drugs, as well as support a wide range of programs for tobacco, HIV prevention and maternal and infant health. Kennedy has since said that because of mistakes, 20% of people fired might be reinstated.",
      "The states who joined the lawsuit have Democratic governors, and many of the same states \u2014 plus a few others \u2014 also sued the Trump administration over $11 billion in cuts to public health funding. A preliminary injunction was granted in that case in mid-May."

      "A northwest Idaho community is still reeling after a 20-year-old man was suspected of fatally shooting two firefighters and injuring another after intentionally starting a fire to ambush them.",
      "Battalion Chiefs John Morrison and Frank J. Harwood were killed in the June 29 attack on Canfield Mountain in Coeur d\u2019Alene. Firefighter/engineer David Tysdal was seriously wounded and remains hospitalized.",
      "Authorities identified the suspect as Wess Roley. Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said it appeared he had been living in his car, and authorities did not know why he was in the area. Roley, who dreamed of becoming a firefighter himself, was found dead on the mountain from a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
      "Who is Wess Roley?",
      "Norris said Roley grew up in an arborist family, telling reporters that the family climbed trees. An arborist is a trained professional in the care and management of trees and woody plants.",
      "\"We did have reports that he was shooting at first responders via a tree,\" he said Monday at a news conference.",
      "Court documents show that Roley may have had a tumultuous childhood. In 2015, his mother, Heather Lynn Cuchiara, sought an order of protection against her then-husband and Roley\u2019s father, Jason Roley.",
      "The documents allege that Jason Roley pushed her to the ground and made threatening remarks about \"waiting outside with a sniper rifle.\" Cuchiara expressed concerns about drugs and two guns in his home and asked that the order of protection include Wess Roley, who was about 10 years old at the time.",
      "Authorities said the 20-year-old had ties to California, Arizona and Idaho. It\u2019s unclear why he was in the area.",
      "Kootenai County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the Coeur d\u2019Alene Police Department had five interactions with Roley, according to Norris. He described the interactions as \"very minor in nature\" and said they had to do with trespassing and \"some welfare checks.\" One welfare check was made after Roley\u2019s car was found parked outside a restaurant \"where he appeared to be residing,\" Norris said.",
      "\"He was asked to leave and he complied,\" he told reporters. None of the welfare checks came from relatives, according to the sheriff. Roley did not have any criminal history.",
      "Roley's parents could be reached for comment. In a statement released Monday night via an attorney, the family said they \"do not understand why this happened or how this came about.\"",
      "\"There are no words that can suffice for this tragedy and the infinite losses suffered by those affected by this shooting,\" they said. \"Our hearts and spirits are broken for the lost and hurting, and for our own loss as well. We intend to fully cooperate with authorities in seeking answers.\"",
      "Roley's grandfather, Dale Roley, said he believes \"something must have snapped\" for his grandson to have committed such a heinous act, especially against firefighters, because he always dreamed of becoming one.",
      "\"He actually really respected law enforcement,\" he told NBC News. \"He loved firefighters. It didn\u2019t make sense that he was shooting firefighters. Maybe he got rejected or something.\"",
      "Authorities said they have not found a manifesto and don't have any indication of a motive.",
      "Norris said investigators are aware of Roley's interest in becoming a firefighter but have not found any applications with local agencies or a statement of intent.",
      "Dale Roley said his grandson could be \"high-strung\" and \"kind of a loner.\" He attributed it to \"normal issues for kids these days,\" but T.J. Franks Jr., Roley\u2019s former roommate, knew something was off.",
      "\"Towards the end, he started acting a little weird, and I don\u2019t know why. But we just explained to him that we needed our own space,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "Roley lived with Franks in Sandpoint, Idaho, for about six months. He moved out in January.",
      "Franks described an incident where he said security cameras at his apartment caught Roley making gang signs, which concerned Franks.",
      "\"He left peacefully,\" he said. \"He just left.\"",
      "Norris said it appears that Roley had been living in his car before the shooting. He was found dead on the mountain from what authorities believe to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
      "Fire was intentionally set, investigators say",
      "Authorities have said they believe Roley intentionally set the blaze to ambush firefighters. He was found with a flint starter and a shotgun, according to Norris.",
      "\"We believe that was his method for starting the fire that eventually led to firefighters responding,\" he said at the news conference.",
      "A man called to report the fire at about 1:20 p.m. local time. Norris said the caller did not use Roley\u2019s name.",
      "Roley and the responding firefighters interacted about where Roley\u2019s vehicle was parked. Norris said that the interaction is still being investigated.",
      "As of Monday night, the Nettleton Gulch Fire had grown to 26 acres. Firefighters were putting water on it from the air and expect to have a containment line soon.",
      "Norris said authorities are slowly making progress with the blaze \"because it\u2019s very difficult terrain to get ground assets up there.\"",
      "Slain firefighters were 'dedicated to their community'",
      "The International Association of Fire Fighters union identified the slain firefighters as Coeur d\u2019Alene Fire Battalion Chief John Morrison and Kootenai County Fire and Rescue Battalion Chief Frank J. Harwood.",
      "Morrison began his career with the Coeur d\u2019Alene department in 1996. He held the ranks of firefighter engineer, captain, battalion chief, and was also a longtime paramedic.",
      "\"He has served the city of Coeur d\u2019Alene and this community for over 28 and a half years,\" Coeur d\u2019Alene Fire Chief Tom Greif said at a news conference.",
      "According to Kootenai County Fire and Rescue Chief Christopher Way, Harwood had been with the Kootenai agency for 17 years. He was also an Army National Guard combat engineer, Way said, describing him as \u201ca leader in our organization.\u201d",
      "He was married with two children.",
      "\"This loss is felt by so many,\" he said.",
      "\"This community lost two dedicated public servants,\" Gabe Eckert, president of the Coeur d\u2019Alene Firefighters\u2019 union, said at a news conference. \"These men were dedicated firefighters; they were dedicated to their community. These guys were hard workers. They loved their families.\"",
      "A procession of emergency vehicles for the firefighters will take place on Tuesday.",
      "Wounded firefighter is \u2018fighting for his life\u2019",
      "Coeur d\u2019Alene firefighter/engineer David Tysdal was seriously wounded and \"is currently fighting for his life and recovery,\" the union said in a message shared by the Coeur d\u2019Alene Fire Department.",
      "Coeur d\u2019Alene Fire Chief Tom Greif said Tysdal had two successful surgeries. In a statement read by the chief, Tysdal's wife thanked the community for their love and support.",
      "\"He is able to open his eyes, and the two surgeries have gone well,\" she said."

    "summary": "Elon Musk and President Donald Trump are fighting again.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk and President Donald Trump are fighting again. Now Musk\u2019s business interests \u2014 and the billions in government contracts they enjoy \u2014 are once again in the crosshairs.",
      "Investors were already punishing Tesla on Tuesday, sending shares in the electric carmaker more than 4% lower in afternoon trading. The stock has experienced a late-spring rally alongside the broader market but remains down some 20% so far this year. The shares have been pummeled by a global backlash to Musk\u2019s alliance with Trump on the campaign trail and in the White House, where the multibillionaire led a sweeping program of government cuts",
      "Musk acknowledged there had been \u201csome blowback\u201d to the actions taken by his Department of Government Efficiency project that may have affected Tesla sales. Yet investors remain largely bullish on the company and its efforts to pivot away from mass-market EVs and toward self-driving taxis and robotics, pushing its market valuation back toward $1 trillion.",
      "Tesla remains Musk\u2019s best-known business, but its fortunes are less directly tied to the government than SpaceX, his rocket-building company. SpaceX\u2019s $350 billion valuation largely rests on the many government contracts that fuel it. SpaceX\u2019s work for NASA has ramped up in recent years in support of the Artemis mission to return to the moon.",
      "Meanwhile, SpaceX\u2019s Dragon spacecraft is currently the only active vessel capable of carrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station. SpaceX has also become essential to the Department of Defense\u2019s missions taking satellites into orbit and today is responsible for the majority of such missions, according to Ars Technica.",
      "SpaceX is privately held, meaning its shares don\u2019t trade on the open market. It is thus difficult to get a real-time gauge on how worsening relations could affect the company\u2019s fortunes. But the impact could be substantial. Since fiscal year 2000, total revenue for SpaceX and Tesla from federal unclassified contracts sits at $22.5 billion, according to Bloomberg Government data \u2014 with most of those going to the former. The Washington Post has put the figure for SpaceX alone at close to $38 billion, with $6.3 billion alone coming in 2024 \u2014 the highest annual total to date.",
      "The dispute with Trump has also taken a chunk out of Musk\u2019s personal net worth. After soaring to an all-time high of nearly half a trillion dollars after Trump\u2019s election win, Musk\u2019s publicly available wealth tally now sits at $400 billion, though that still makes him the world\u2019s wealthiest individual by nearly $150 billion ahead of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, another Trump ally.",
      "The Musk-Trump tiff first exploded into public view last month, shortly after Musk formally stepped down from his special government employee role and criticized the massive spending and tax cut bill that Republican senators passed Tuesday. Trump responded at the time by threatening to \u201cterminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.\u201d",
      "Musk, in turn, said he would begin \u201cdecommissioning\u201d the Dragon, only to reverse course hours later after an X user advised him and Trump to \u201ccool off and take a step back for a couple of days.\u201d",
      "Before their initial flare-up subsided, Musk announced he would be reining in his political spending weeks after a candidate he had backed lost a key Wisconsin Supreme Court race. Some analysts believe the current relapse in tensions between the two men will be short-lived given Musk\u2019s reliance on the government, and vice-versa.",
      "Still, Musk is now discussing launching his own political party to address the U.S.\u2019s fiscal imbalances, which he believes Trump\u2019s bill will exacerbate \u2014 a contention supported by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. While the South Africa-born executive is ineligible to run for office, any candidate he backed for national office would likely face immediate conflict-of-interest questions."

      "According to the complaint filed Friday in the Central District of California, Costco allegedly \"unlawfully traded\" on Lululemon's \"reputation, goodwill and sweat equity\" by selling unauthorized and unlicensed knockoffs and dupes, infringing on the company's popular patents.",

The lawsuit claims it's a dupe for Lululemon\u2019s SCUBA pullover that sells for $118. Costco's \"Jockey Ladies Yoga Jacket\" and \"Spyder Women\u2019s Yoga Jacket,\" which sell for $22, appear to be a dupe of Lululemon's DEFINE jacket with a price tag of $128. The \"Kirkland 5 Pocket Performance Pant,\" sold online for $10, is a dupe for Lululemon\u2019s $128 ABC Pant, the complaint contended.",
      "The lawsuit alleged trade dress infringement, unfair competition under the Lanham Act, patent infringement, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act.",
      "Lululemon seeks to recover monetary damages from lost profits, claiming it suffered \"significant harm\" to its brands and reputation.",
      "Dupes have surged in popularity, fueled by social media and young people seeking trendy, high-quality clothing without breaking the bank. The suit noted that hashtags like \"LululemonDupes\" have trended on social media platforms like TikTok, with influencers promoting \"these copycat products.\"",
      "Lululemon, based in Vancouver, acknowledged some companies have replicated its proprietary apparel designs and sold them as \"dupes.\"  The company said it has sent cease and desist letters to such companies, including Costco.",
      "Specifically, the suit claimed Costco sells dupes of Lululemon\u2019s popular SCUBA, DEFINE, and ABC lines, \"which have earned substantial fame and considerable goodwill among the public.\"",
      "Costco allegedly profited off confusion and allowed customers to believe the products are authentic, the lawsuit claimed.",

      "\"This source ambiguity preconditions at least some consumers into believing that private label, Kirkland-branded dupes are in fact manufactured by the authentic suppliers of the \u2018original\u2019 products. Defendant does not dispel this ambiguity,\" the complaint said.",
      "In November, Lululemon wrote to Costco about the infringement, and Costco subsequently removed at least some of the products that infringed Lululemon\u2019s SCUBA mark, but later began selling the Hi-Tec Men\u2019s Scuba full zip, the complaint said.",
      "The suit seeks a jury trial and for the court to order Costco to pay Lululemon damages in the form of lost profits, an order to permanently restrain Costco from making or selling more dupes, and an order to remove any ads or posts displaying the infringing products.",
      "Costco did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment on Tuesday.",

      "So how involved are you on the production side of things? Do you get to decide when new bombshells are coming in, when to change up the rules for Casa, like we did this year?",
      "No, I just hear about things maybe a couple days beforehand. Or, you know, of course, if there\u2019s something that\u2019s planned way in advance, I\u2019ll hear about it, and I can say, \u201cWow, I love that.\u201d Or, \u201cHmm, I\u2019m not sure about that,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not in charge.",
      "Let\u2019s talk about Nic and Olandria. Do you think we\u2019ll be seeing a return of them later this season? I know on \u201cAftersun,\u201d you mentioned that you saw some chemistry between them.",
      "Yeah, I think the chemistry, when you watch that kiss in Soul Ties, was palpable from watching it on the screen. When they said that they didn\u2019t feel any sparks, I was very confused because I feel like I saw sparks. That being said, you know, I think, honestly, I just want both of them to find whatever it is that they\u2019re looking for. And I\u2019m so happy that whatever it took to get Olandria a little bit away from thinking about Taylor, I think is a positive.",
      "I mean, that being said, I love Cierra and Nic together, so I don\u2019t want to speak ill of that relationship, because I think that is a really good relationship, too. But you know, who knows? You never know what\u2019s going to happen day to day in that villa. Things happen so fast.",
      "What do you think about some of the other couples on the show, like Chelley and Ace, and Zak and Amaya?",
      "I mean, I feel like Chelley and Ace, they took so long to actually couple up, which was interesting, because I felt like they had had this flirtation for so long, but you know, watching the episode with the heart-rate challenge, you see that Chelley still wants to remain open to Chris, so that\u2019s going to be interesting. I feel like Ace might be getting a little bit of a taste of his own medicine there, because he was really putting on the pressure when Chelley was with Austin. And now Chelley\u2019s with Ace, and Chris is putting on the pressure, so he feel knows what it feels like to be on the other side of that.",
      "Amaya and Zach. I think they\u2019re so cute. I love getting to see these little moments of them talk about cats or, you know, hula hooping in Casa. I just love the slice-of-life moments in the villa that we get to see because to me, that\u2019s when you really get to see what everyone\u2019s like around each other. So I hope we get to see more of that and more of them as well.",
      "Let\u2019s talk about the virality of it all. \u201cLove Island\u201d has been blowing up absolutely everywhere. Do you see these viral moments as they\u2019re happening, or are you just as surprised as we are?",
      "I mean, I watch all the episodes, of course, and then you never know what\u2019s going to gain traction online, what\u2019s going to be something that people really connect with. And so with the \u201cmommy-mamacita\u201d moment, I feel like watching the episode, I thought that was a hilarious moment, but then when it took on a life of its own online, it made it even more fun. And I feel like I\u2019m constantly reposting people doing that audio now, because it\u2019s just too funny.",
      "Megan Thee Stallion came on the show! Let\u2019s talk about that iconic and surprising collaboration, as well as whether any other influential figures might be fans of the show.",
      "It\u2019s funny, because I feel like every year, we find more and more influential figures that are big fans. Or, even right now, with Olivia Rodrigo and Ed Sheeran doing the \u201cLove Island\u201d audio \u2014 I\u2019m pretty sure Ed Sheeran communicates via email, so he probably does not watch \u201cLove Island USA\u201d \u2014 but to have Olivia explaining to him what is \u201cLove Island USA,\u201d to me, is a moment that I wish I could be a fly on the wall for because I can only imagine how funny that is. And Megan Thee Stallion, is someone I\u2019ve been a huge fan of for a very long time. I\u2019ve gone to see her live performing so many times, and getting to meet her, she is an absolute delight of a person. She has the most beautiful energy, and I\u2019m in love with her.",
      "Viewers didn\u2019t get to see the deliberation process when Hannah and Jeremiah left the villa, which Iain told us earlier was the most shocking thing he\u2019d seen all season long. What might be a little bit of the process behind that deliberation? If you heard anything, would you be able to speak on that?",
      "I wasn\u2019t in the villa that day, so I wasn\u2019t watching, you know, the monitors of what they were talking about. But considering that, it was a big moment, and when they\u2019re editing that episode and putting it together, my major guesstimation is that they really wanted to keep in other conversations that they felt were really important to the storyline. So maybe more showing him or other people talking earlier in the episode about things, and then maybe after the fact, they wanted to really be able to show more of what it was like when everyone was saying goodbye and stuff like that. And if the deliberation was redundant or boring or fairly inconsequential or not really different to what they were talking about outside of the actual deliberation, there\u2019s really no point in showing it.",
      "I know you didn\u2019t want to say earlier who you\u2019re rooting for this season, but is there a couple that maybe you\u2019re not as excited to see on your screen?",
      "I guess ... they\u2019re not a couple as of this point that I know of right now, but I am never excited to see Taylor be wishy-washy about who he wants to be in a couple with, and I\u2019m definitely never excited to see Olandria second-guess her worth. Those are two things I\u2019m never excited to see. So I am kind of hoping that she finds the right person for her and not someone who\u2019s wishy-washy about whether or not they want to be with her.",
      "What is the most shocking thing that you\u2019ve seen this season?",
      "Oh, I think Charlie\u2019s dumping was very shocking. I really did not expect that at all.",

      "\"Sometimes as a mom, you look back on your day and you're like, 'How the heck did I get all those things done?'\" she says. \"You rise to the occasion, and you don't give the workload a second thought. You just do it because it needs to be done.\""

      "Player 222, Kim Jun-hee (played by Jo Yu-ri), is introduced as a quiet but resilient contestant.",
      "Viewers soon learn she was lured into the game after being conned by her ex-boyfriend, Player 333, Lee Myung-gi (Im Si-wan), who tricked her into investing in a cryptocurrency scam that leaves her in debt.",
      "Here's what to know about her fate, and her child's.",
      "What happens to Player 222 in the games?",
      "In a pivotal hide-and-seek challenge, Jun-hee breaks her ankle and goes into labor.",
      "With help from Player 149, Jang Geum-ja (Kang Ae-shim), a former nurse, and Player 120, Cho Hyun-ju (Park Sung-hoon), the show\u2019s first transgender character, she gives birth while hiding from guards and other competitors.",

      "\u201cThe robot had actual facial expressions. It would wiggle like a newborn baby, and the weight was quite realistic. So that helped me a lot with my performance,\u201d Lee said."

    "summary": "Katie Sturino opens up about writing her first novel and her role in the body positivity space.",
    "story": [
      "Katie Sturino opens her first novel with a scene that many of her readers will likely find uncomfortably familiar: Trying on a bathing suit in a well-lit dressing room and not liking what you see in the mirror.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a universal thing,\u201d Sturino tells TODAY.com. \u201cWho has not been able to find something in a store, and then left feeling like you triggered an eating disorder?\u201d",
      "The book's protagonist, Sunny, grapples with the feeling of being big in a world that wants her to be smaller. Sturino herself can relate.",
      "Her debut novel fits into the mission she\u2019s carved as a truth-teller speaking up around expectations of women\u2019s bodies as a multi-hyphenate entrepreneur, blogger and voice in the body positivity space.",
      "The book character Sunny shares obvious similarities with Sturino too. Sunny runs a PR company; Sturino ran a PR company for years. Sunny is getting over a divorce from an influencer; Sturino divorced Josh Ostrovsky, known as The Fat Jewish online, in 2017. Sunny loves her rescue dogs; Sturino\u2019s dogs had their own viral accounts. Sunny starts a business (swimsuits); Sturino started a business (personal care brand Megababe).",
      "\u201cThere are certainly a lot of things that are taken from my life,\u201d Sturino says, noting that the book's individuals are fictional \u2014 for the most part. She did base one of Sunny\u2019s suitors directly on her now-husband, John Forkin. \u201cI learned what good, healthy love looks like from him and I wanted to show that to people,\u201d she says.",
      "The character overlap is entirely on purpose: This is the book Sturino says she wanted after her divorce in 2017. \u201cThis book offers an alternative narrative to the typical breakup story, which is like, girl gets dumped, then, like gets a glow up and finds she\u2019s worthy of love,\u201d she says.",
      "The book defies typical narratives. Instead of a \u201crevenge body,\u201d for example, Sunny gains weight, just like Sturino did after her divorce. Sturino avoided the revenge-body trope on purpose. \u201cIt reinforces the idea that there is only one way to find to be worthy of love, and that is to be at your smallest, most fit body,\u201d she says.",
      "Sunny gets the guy and her happily ever after without trying to change who she is or how she looks. Still, Sunny's relationship with her body impacts every part of the plot. It\u2019s the inspiration for Sunny\u2019s swimsuit brand. It comes up when she\u2019s dating. It\u2019s in the haunting remarks of her ex. And yet she expresses frustration about it \u2014 she\u2019s tired of having to talk about her body.",
      "The press tour for \u201cSunny Side Up\u201d has often pointed to Sturino\u2019s own body and journey. Amid the interviews, Sturino opened up about using a type of weight-loss medication called a GLP-1 agonist to lower her A1C (a measure of blood sugar levels) after trying other interventions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that so often women are not allowed to just talk about their work without including the body narrative,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd by body, I really mean weight. I just don\u2019t think that we talk about men that way in the media, and it\u2019s pretty consistent that we talk about women like that.\u201d",
      "Sturino says she starting taking a GLP-1 agonist for her health and now is approached by people asking if they have to get on it, too. \u201cI\u2019m like, 'No, you don\u2019t have to get on this.' That\u2019s the downside of having the conversation everywhere \u2014 there is a pressure,\u201d she says.",
      "Ultimately, she's happy to be transparent. \u201cI hope that sharing my story helps someone too. And based on the comments I\u2019ve gotten recently, I think it has,\u201d she says.",
      "Sunny, by the end of the book, comes to a conclusion that her body wasn\u2019t the problem. If there\u2019s anything Sturino wants her followers to know from her work, it\u2019s just that.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the main messaging on my channel. You can lose weight, gain weight, have a baby, aging, all these different ways our body changes over our life. You have to do the work in your brain to accept your body, because your body will change throughout your life. If you don\u2019t do that work, then every single change is a jump scare,\u201d she says.",
      "She calls her book an \u201canchor\u201d in a new landscape where skinny seems to be en vogue again, no thanks recent social media trends and speculation about which celebrities are taking Ozempic and why.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really hard time. But it doesn\u2019t mean that we just throw the last 10 years down the drain and just say, well, we\u2019re back here. I think if you want to keep the fight up, you can, and you should.\u201d",
      "There are days it seems the body positivity movement \u2014 which promoted accepting bodies of all sizes \u2014 is, well, over. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be,\u201d she says. \u201cWe choose what\u2019s important.\"",

    "summary": "Queer love stories are as iconic as the LGBTQ+ community that it centers on. To highlight some of these stories, TODAY.com has compiled a list of 25 queer romance films to watch.",
    "story": [
      "Queer love stories have stood the test of time as filmmakers strive to tell authentic narratives, despite LGBTQ+ representation in films facing challenges throughout history.",
      "Films showcasing love in the LGBTQ+ community have been around for more than a century. Over time, they've become an important form of queer representation, helping to counter stereotypes and combat negative tropes in media.",
      "But, getting to this level of representation wasn\u2019t easy. While films depicting queer love were not formally banned, the Hays Code, also known as the Motion Picture Production Code, had Hollywood studios self-enforce a set of guidelines from around 1934 to 1968 to prevent government interference. Centered around \"moral standards\" and social values, the guidelines purported to ensure movies presented viewers with \"correct standards of life\" by banning profanity, obscenity and graphic violence. It also prevented overt or positive portrayals of LGBTQ+ relationships, according to a library guide from Ithaca College.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until the 1960s that the Hays Code was effectively challenged. The organization now known as the Motion Picture Association (MPA) established a film content rating system in 1968 which served as the code\u2019s replacement.",
      "Though it\u2019s been over 50 years since the Hays Code, and much progress has been made for LGBTQ+ representation in cinema, there still remain ongoing challenges for accurate and authentic narratives. The queer community continues to navigate a fickle film industry that periodically offers room for diverse storytelling, but can miss the mark with film tropes like the \u201cgay best friend,\u201d the \u201ccloseted bully\" or \"bury your gays,\" referring to a pattern of queer characters being killed off in shows and movies.",
      "Carlos King, CEO of Kingdom Reign Entertainment and a TV industry creative, tells TODAY.com that it\u2019s important to have authentic queer stories on screen so viewers can move past stereotypes and caricatures.",
      "\u201cI want to see (movies) starring queer people, not as being the sidekick to the main cast member or being the glam squad that we just see on television,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are leading. We have leading roles in our personal lives. We are executives. We\u2019re a vice president, presidents, CEOs of multiple companies.\u201d",
      "King says he strives to bring the representation \u2014 including that of love in the LGBTQ+ community \u2014\u00a0that he didn't have growing up to the screen.",
      "\u201cBeing a young gay Black boy from Detroit, Michigan, one of 10 siblings, I know all about desiring to look at a television screen and wanting to see someone like you reflected back,\" he says.",
      "Filmmaker Elegance Bratton, whose 2022 autobiographical breakout military drama, \u201cThe Inspection,\u201d received rave reviews from critics, tells TODAY.com that showing queer romance on screen helps to combat the negativity often felt in society.",
      "\u201cShowing love is always a good thing. We live in a world where hatred of queer people is reaching a fever point,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe need to see queer people loving on each other because it\u2019s real. We do love and that spirit is indomitable.\u201d",
      "Andrea Ambam, director of programming at Level Forward, a public benefit entertainment company, agrees, telling TODAY.com that seeing these stories on the big screen can help members of the LGBTQ+ community feel seen.",
      "\u201cI know and believe that queer films are important because of the way they\u2019re able to reach us through the screen,\u201d she says. \u201cThe way they\u2019re able to find, often, young people who may or may not be questioning their belonging in their homes, in their schools, in their communities, and they reach across the screen and say, \u2018You belong. You are here. There are more people like you.\u2019\u201d"

      "\u201cDrug addiction led me to a critical condition. I couldn\u2019t find a way out, and I was scared,\u201d he told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "A year ago, he managed to escape from a panic house (also known as panicueva, or panic cave) commonly used by organized crime gangs in Mexico. Some of these buildings, located in Guanajuato and other states where drug use is rampant, also serve as recruitment bases for young people selected to become hit men and operatives for these criminal groups.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the place where you can go, buy your drugs, and get high right there,\u201d said another 19-year-old who managed to escape a panic house and was interviewed by Noticias Telemundo on the condition that he remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.",
      "\"I entered a panic house and saw several women who had to prostitute themselves, and several of my friends got involved in selling drugs and ended up being killed,\u201d said the young man. He said he spent five years living in one of the houses and eventually joined a local gang.",
      "According to the latest report issued by the Mexican government, Guanajuato is the state with the highest number of homicides (980 from January to April). In February, the daily average reached 12.5. Last year, the Victimization and Security Perception Survey revealed that 87.5% of the population in Guanajuato considered public safety to be the most serious problem in the state.",
      "\"They've put a gun to my head, they\u2019ve threatened me, they\u2019ve told me I\u2019m done, that\u2019s it. But the most horrible thing I\u2019ve seen is how they killed my best friend,\u201d the young man said, referring to his experience in the shelters.",

      "'They are recruiting more minors'",
      "Guanajuato is grappling with gang clashes over criminal activities such as fuel trafficking, and is also the epicenter of a growing methamphetamine epidemic.

      "\"Drug houses\" aren\u2019t unique to Mexico; similar trends exist in other countries, such as drug houses in the United States or drug dens in Spain. \u201cWhile criminals may be attracted to abandoned houses, these are also spaces where potential victims and criminals tend to converge without surveillance. Our results support the idea that abandoned houses also generate crime,\u201d said Lauren C. Porter, a professor at the University of Maryland who co-wrote a study on the issue.",

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 As the dust settles on Iran after unprecedented Israeli and American attacks, the U.S. and Israel have shifted their focus toward an ambitious diplomatic push they hope will translate into the kind of enduring political stability that has evaded the region for decades.",
      "Despite apparent Iranian unwillingness, President Donald Trump is pushing for more talks with Tehran about its nuclear program. But Israel appears more interested in formalizing diplomatic relations with some of its long-standing adversaries, as well as ending the 18-month conflict in Gaza \u2014 which Trump has repeatedly pleaded for.",
      "\u201cThis victory presents an opportunity for a dramatic widening of peace agreements,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe are working on this with enthusiasm.\u201d",
      "The previous Trump administration brokered what it called the Abraham Accords, in which Israel established diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain and later normalized its relations with Morocco in 2024 and Sudan, though that deal has yet to be ratified.",
      "Having devastated the powerful, Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, its northern neighbor, and seen a Tehran-friendly regime toppled in Syria to the east, Israel is now interested in establishing formal diplomatic relations with both countries, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday",
      "The shift represents a broader change in Israeli policy toward its neighbors. Until around two weeks ago, Israel\u2019s modus operandi was to assert military dominance as a political strategy, according to Michael Oren, who served as the country\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. from 2009 to 2013.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s the first time that I\u2019ve seen in history when we have the opportunity to make the strategy the strategy. It\u2019s not a tactic,\u201d Oren, a former member of Israel\u2019s Knesset, or parliament, who served as deputy minister in the prime minister\u2019s office, told NBC News in a phone call on Friday.",
      "Before the Hamas-led terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel relied on a method known in Hebrew as \u201cmowing the grass.\u201d The term was used by strategists to describe the country\u2019s periodic attacks against Palestinian militants and their supply of weapons in Gaza, attacks that faced widespread criticism from rights groups often because of the disproportionate number of deaths caused by Israeli forces.",
      "The phrase could also apply to Israel's behavior toward Iran and its proxies in taking out military commanders, nuclear scientists and senior advisers to the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while attacking nuclear and military sites. In Lebanon, it has wiped out large swaths of Hezbollah\u2019s leadership.",
      "Today, Netanyahu\u2019s most formidable challenge will be finding a resolution to end the conflict in Gaza, where, despite nearly 20 months of war, Hamas remains nominally in control.",
      "Under pressure from Trump, who on Truth Social on Sunday again called for a \u201cdeal in Gaza\u201d and to \u201cget the hostages back,\u201d the negotiations are also still captive to the same disagreements that have long delayed a deal.",
      "Hamas has refused to release its remaining hostages and surrender \u2014 key demands of far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s government, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, his national security minister, both of whom have threatened to quit and bring down the fragile coalition if he does otherwise. Along with other lawmakers they have also called for the complete destruction of Hamas.",
      "Hamas, meanwhile, has demanded a permanent truce, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and guarantees about humanitarian aid.",
      "The decline of power in Iran, Hamas' primary patron, will likely sap the group\u2019s confidence and influence, according to Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, an independent research center.",
      "\u201cFrom an Israeli standpoint, this is a dramatic shift in the acceptance for the Jewish state in the region,\u201d added Plesner, a former member of the Israeli parliament.",
      "But he cautioned that as long as Hamas is the governing body in Gaza, a deal to end the war there \u201cwill be something that is possible but it will be very difficult for the Israeli government to swallow.\u201d",
      "For now, Israel is in the ascendancy: Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been badly damaged, its 46-year-old Islamic regime is weakened and its proxy groups and allies throughout the region have been extensively damaged.",
      "Perhaps most important is that while the Israeli and U.S. attacks on Iran were publicly criticized, they were also quietly welcomed by its Arab neighbors, many of whom were quicker to condemn Iran\u2019s reprisal attack on the U.S. military base in Qatar than the American attack on Iran.",
      "For decades Iran has fostered allied regimes and proxy militia throughout the Middle East in order to fight Israel, its major ally in the region, the United States, and Shiite-majority Iran\u2019s adversaries among the Sunni-led Gulf kingdoms.",
      "Israel will now need those states to blaze a path toward an enduring peace, analysts said, or risk inflaming regional conflict even more.",
      "\u201cI think we see imperial Iran is in retreat,\u201d Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an associate professor of political science at the United Arab Emirates University in Al Ain, said in a phone interview last week. \u201cIt probably means a more stable Middle East, a more stable region.\u201d",
      "Israel and the United States would do better to cultivate what Abdullah described as an \u201cAxis of Moderation\u201d of monied Gulf Arab kingdoms, many of whom have normalized relations with Israel \u2014 a play on the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d used to describe Iran and its regional proxy groups that Israel has largely defeated.",
      "Israel has nonetheless made clear its intention to continue attacking Iran\u2019s nuclear program should a perceived need arise. And in Gaza and Lebanon, it has continued to launch regular strikes against what it says are militant targets long after ceasefires were put in place.",
      "But Trump, whose angry outburst appeared to rein in an Israeli strike on Iran after he declared a ceasefire in the region, has shown he is capable of halting Israel\u2019s responses. Oren said this could help pave the way toward lasting stability by restraining Israel\u2019s more militant instincts.",
      "\u201cThe difference between tactics and strategy is in the hands of Donald Trump,\u201d Oren said. \u201cTo the greatest extent in Israel\u2019s history, our fate is in the hands of one person, and it\u2019s not the prime minister.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Google's much-hyped new U.K. headquarters in London's King's Cross neighborhood hasn't opened yet, but it's already drawn some unexpected attention from locals.",
      "Local foxes, that is.",
      "The building, which is under construction, has been nicknamed the \"landscraper\" because it spans 1,082 feet wide and 11 floors tall.",
      "Created by British designer Thomas Heatherwick, it will reportedly be completed later this year and cost the tech giant upwards of \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion). Construction began in 2017. It is anticipated to eventually house up to 7,000 Google employees.",
      "For now, however, some of the more frequent visitors might be the foxes that have been digging burrows in the manicured grounds and leaving their droppings behind on the building's nearly 1,000-foot-long rooftop garden.",
      "\u201cFox sightings at construction sites are pretty common, and our King\u2019s Cross development is no exception,\u201d a Google spokesperson told NBC News. But, the person added, \u201cWhile foxes have been occasionally spotted at the site, their appearances have been brief and have had minimal impact on the ongoing construction.\u201d",
      "NBC News spoke to nearly two dozen construction workers at the construction site, where a cacophony of noise from the drilling and hammering filled the streets as dust dispersed into the air. But when asked whether they had seen any foxes, most refused to comment, citing nondisclosure agreements.",
      "One worker, who requested anonymity due to the NDA, told NBC News, \u201cPersonally, I haven\u2019t seen one, but there are so many open entrances to the building I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it had gotten inside.\u201d",
      "Still, Kareen Mascerenhas, 25, who works at a store directly across from the construction site, said she had spotted a fox last winter. \u201cI was shutting the store when I saw one just run past that side and in there,\u201d she said, pointing to Google\u2019s construction.",
      "But any sightings of the bushy-tailed vulpines feel neither rare nor unique in a city where the number of foxes soars between 10,000 and 15,000, accounting for nearly 16 foxes per square mile.",
      "Around the country, their population ebbs and flows depending on the season, from 150,000 in the winter to around 400,000 during cub season, according to Terry Woods, who founded the fox removal company Fox-a-Gon, which advocates for the humane treatment of the animals.",
      "For decades, foxes have also captured the British imagination, appearing as the sly character Mr. Tod in Beatrix Potter's novels, and in Roald Dahl's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\" And most recently, one even served as a memorable symbol for the \u201chot priest\u201d in the hit television show \"Fleabag\" by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.",
      "Though they are often seen boldly trotting along sidewalks and rummaging through residential bins, foxes have also roused strong reactions from onlookers, ranging from adoration to outright resentment.",
      "\u201cThey may appear cuddly and romantic, but foxes are also a pest and a menace, particularly in our cities,\u201d former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told BBC News in 2013, then as the mayor of London, when a fox horrified the British public after biting off a baby\u2019s finger.",
      "For years, foxes perfectly concealed their identity as the main culprits behind hundreds of cat mutilations in the south London suburb of Croydon, where the grisly carcasses strewn across streets and backyards led distressed residents to suspect that a deranged cat killer was on the loose until police realized what was happening in 2018.",
      "While some residents cherish their presence, hoping to charm the typically contact-averse creatures by trying to feed them, a series of British wildlife laws also gives foxes the protection and freedom to roam the United Kingdom\u2019s cities endlessly.",
      "\u201cFoxes are quite popular around this area; they are just virtually everywhere,\u201d said 31-year-old Ode Tomitoba, who works at the King\u2019s Cross Visitors Center.",
      "For Hanei Mokenen, 23, who manages a restaurant in King\u2019s Cross, news of the latest fox incursion came by way of a TikTok video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s King\u2019s Cross, anything can happen here,\u201d he said about the bustling commercial neighborhood in Central London, adding that he had occasionally seen a fox running around the area.",
      "But their stealth around the giant Google edifice had nonetheless taken Mokenen by surprise. \u201cHow the hell did they get inside? Security is strong in this area; it\u2019s not a place where you can just walk around,\u201d he said.",
      "The foxes\u2019 newfound home at Google\u2019s offices isn\u2019t the first time the animals have made themselves comfortable in London\u2019s skyscrapers. In 2011, a fox called Romeo was discovered living in The Shard, surviving on the food scraps left by construction workers.",
      "\u201cIt is a fairly common occurrence with the creatures being so adaptable,\u201d said Woods from Fox-a-Gon, who helped remove Romeo from the site by capturing him safely and releasing him back into the urban jungle.",
      "\u201cThey are such an adaptable animal that they can survive almost anywhere and overcome great hardships,\u201d he added."

    "story": [
      "Sitting off the Horn of Africa, the Yemeni island of Socotra was largely left to its own devices for centuries, its few guests arriving to trade for aromatic frankincense, the healing plant aloe and the crimson sap of the dragon\u2019s blood tree, used for dyes.",
      "Roughly the size of New York\u2019s Long Island, Socotra is about 140 miles off the coast of Somalia, a remote location that has allowed a unique ecosystem to flourish. It has a rich array of bird and animal life, and the coral reefs off its shores teem with colorful marine life. One-third of its 825 plant species cannot be found anywhere else on Earth, according to UNESCO.",
      "Some, including conservationist Kay Van Damme, have called it the Gal\u00e1pagos of the Indian Ocean and along with other experts, he is warning that millions of years of evolution on Socotra could be under \u201cserious threat.\u201d",
      "\u201cClimate change is by far the biggest threat to the island\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d Van Damme, who has worked on Socotra for more than two decades, told NBC News in a call last month. \u201cIt is a relatively small island with a predominantly arid climate. Even small additional impacts from climate change can have an outsized effect, putting further pressure on fragile ecosystems.\u201d",
      "Prolonged droughts brought on by climate change are compounding damage from devastating cyclones in 2015 and 2018 that destroyed reefs, eroded soil and uprooted rare plants.",
      "The island\u2019s lifeblood, endemic species of frankincense trees, are also under threat. Four of the 11 recognized species on the island were classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in March.",
      "Five were recognized as endangered.\u201cTheir decline reflects the wider degradation of terrestrial habitats across the island and the ecosystems they support,\u201d said Van Damme, adding that overgrazing \u2014 predominantly from goats \u2014 is another significant challenge, leading to habitat degradation and \u201cleaving behind overmature trees with fewer younger trees to replace them.\u201d",
      "Tourism\u2019s growing footprint",
      "Attracted by Socotra\u2019s pristine beaches, turquoise waters and surreal flora, tourists are also placing mounting pressure on the island\u2019s fragile ecosystem.",
      "While there is only a handful of hotels, mostly in the capital Hadibo, a growing number of tour operators offer luxury camping and 4x4 tours around the island, some of which are packaged as ecotourism.",
      "Authorities have agreed to limit the number of tourists to around 4,500 per year, Ali Yahya, a local conservationist and tour operator, said in an interview last month, adding that when it came to \u201cvery sensitive areas in terms of ecosystems, biodiversity and cultural heritage, it\u2019s strictly not allowed to build any big buildings or large-scale hotels.\u201d",
      "But despite Socotra\u2019s UNESCO World Heritage designation \u2014 requiring preservation under international agreements \u2014 violations occur frequently, another local guide, Abdulraoof al-Gamhi, said in a series of voice and written messages last month.",
      "\u201cSome tourists build fires under dragon blood trees, carve inscriptions into rare trees, leave trash behind them and scare birds with their drones,\u201d he said. But he added that many of the island\u2019s residents benefit from tourism and that it is \u201cvery important\u201d for \u201ctour companies, car owners, drivers, restaurants, hotels and sellers of handcrafts.\u201d",
      "Echoing his concerns, Van Damme also said endangered species were \u201cbeing killed just for a selfie,\u201d with rare species like chameleons being captured so tourists can take pictures with them.",
      "Al-Gamhi also said he expected the number of tourists to rise as more people discover the unique locale, and \u201cthat will put a lot of pressure on our environment.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will be a big challenge,\u201d he added.",
      "A cautionary tale",
      "Although the Gal\u00e1pagos comparison is often used to celebrate Socotra\u2019s biodiversity, it can also serve as a warning, according to Van Damme, who co-authored a 2011 study on human impacts on the island.",
      "Since the 19th century, the Gal\u00e1pagos, remote islands some 600 miles off the coast of mainland Ecuador known for their unique flora and fauna, have lost numerous endemic species to habitat disruption, overtourism and invasive species.",
      "\u201cPerhaps Socotran ecosystems,\u201d Van Damme wrote at the time, \u201ccould now be considered as having at least, a similar state of health of those in the Gal\u00e1pagos at the time of [the Ecuadorian islands\u2019] nomination as world heritage site 30 years ago.\u201d He added that Socotra risked a similar fate without \u201ctimely conservation efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we consider the present-day condition in the Gal\u00e1pagos, we might catch a glimpse of Socotra\u2019s future, or better, what could happen if trends and threats continue in parallel,\u201d the paper added.",
      "That assessment \u201cturned out to be very predictive,\u201d particularly in terms of climate change, he told NBC News.",
      "The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands now host over 250,000 annual visitors, under strict controls including visitor caps, mandatory guides, designated trails and substantial tourism fees, which fund conservation.",
      "Socotra needs to implement similar protections before damage becomes irreversible, Van Damme said.",
      "Culture and tradition",
      "Beyond the environment, there are signs that tourism is also eroding the island\u2019s social fabric, according to Yahya, who said there was already a \u201ccultural shift\u201d among its 60,000 residents, many of whom remain deeply traditional and speak Soqotri, an ancient, unwritten language with pre-Islamic roots.",
      "\u201cInternational behaviors are influencing locals, and we worry about the erosion of our traditions,\u201d he said, adding that while tourists were welcome, some of them needed to be more respectful.",
      "An Instagram picture of a woman posing in a bikini beneath a dragon\u2019s blood tree had upset residents of one mountain village, he said, adding that it was seen as highly disrespectful by the conservative residents.",
      "Despite the pressures, there are reasons to be positive, Van Damme said, noting that authorities on the island are open to collaboration and local conservation projects are gaining traction.",
      "\u201cCommunity-led and other ongoing initiatives are vital,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as they continue, there\u2019s genuine hope for the island\u2019s future.\u201d"

      "Pileups were frequent as players toppled over each other in slow-motion collisions, goals were left open, and defending appeared optional. Some robots hogged the ball, others struggled to stay upright, and two or three had to be loaded onto a stretcher and carried off the field.",
      "While the play was absurd, the tech powering it was anything but.",
      "Each team operated fully autonomously, driven by AI, with no human intervention or supervision \u2014 an impressive breakthrough somewhat masked by the slapstick spectacle playing out on the field.",

By 2050, China is expected to have 302.3 million humanoid robots in use, far ahead of the U.S. projection of 77.7 million, the report added, noting these would likely be used for \u201crepetitive, simple, and structured work,\u201d like in factories.",
      "\u201cIt is becoming apparent that national support for \u2018embodied AI\u2019 may be far greater in China than in any other nation, driving continued innovation,\u201d said Sheng Zhong, Morgan Stanley\u2019s head of industrials research. \u201cIn our opinion, China\u2019s lead in AI-robotics may need to widen before rivals, including the U.S., pay closer attention.\u201d",
      "Sports is becoming a key part of China\u2019s push.",
      "In April, 21 humanoid robots recently competed alongside humans in a half-marathon in Beijing, though only six managed to finish. Saturday\u2019s soccer match also served as a preview for the upcoming 2025 World Humanoid Robot Games, which China will host in Beijing Aug. 15\u201317. The event will feature 11 robot sports, including gymnastics, track and field, and soccer.",
      "Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics \u2014 the company that supplied the robot players at Saturday\u2019s soccer tournament \u2014 said sports competitions are a testing ground for humanoid robots. Their successes and stumbles on the field help accelerate the development of both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.",
      "He also explained that safety is a core concern about humanoid robots.",
      "\u201cIn the future, we may arrange for robots to play soccer with humans. That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe,\u201d Cheng said, referring to a perceived risk that a heavy robot could fall on and injure a human athlete, for example.",
      "\u201cA robot and a human could play a match where winning doesn\u2019t matter, but real offensive and defensive interactions take place. That would help audiences build trust and understand that robots are safe,\u201d he said.",
      "Ironically, China\u2019s humanoids may be more entertaining than their human counterparts.",
      "With the men\u2019s national team languishing at 94th in the FIFA rankings and likely to miss out on the next World Cup, the robots at least know how to put on a show \u2014 and score.",

      "LONDON \u2014 It was not her best goal or most important soccer match, but when the ball hit the back of the net in Natalie Washington's debut on a women's team in 2017, she felt a sense of belonging that had been missing.",
      "It was long in coming: Washington had struggled to fit in on a men's team and eventually stopped playing when she decided to transition to being a woman and go through gender-affirming surgery. When she joined a women's team, she quickly felt accepted.",
      "Now, after the United Kingdom's highest court in April said that for anti-discrimination purposes the terms \"woman\" and \"man\" refer to biological sex, Washington's opportunity to play the sport she loves in the league she wants is in doubt.",
      "The head of the U.K's Equality and Human Rights Commission followed the ruling a day later by saying the court had provided clarity and that transgender women would be excluded from women-only spaces such as toilets, single-sex hospital wards and sports teams.",
      "The Football Association, the regulatory body for soccer in the U.K., followed up by banning transgender players from women's teams in England and Scotland, a ban that took effect at the start of June.",
      "\"It feels like things are being taken away from trans people on an almost daily basis,\" Washington said. \"It's another blow, another kick at a time when people are already hurting.\"",
      "Long a divisive issue",
      "Beyond Britain, inclusion of trans players in sports has long been a divisive issue, with arguments primarily focused on whether it's fair to have athletes born as boys compete against girls and women. In the U.S., it has been particularly politicized, with most Republican-controlled states banning transgender athletes in girls' sports and President Donald Trump signing an executive order to prohibit participation of transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports.",
      "The U.K. court said trans people were still protected from discrimination under British law, such as in employment, housing and education, but the ruling means access to certain single-sex facilities could be curtailed.",
      "Trans rights groups condemned the decision, which is likely to have a profound effect for thousands. Out of some 66 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, about 116,000 identified as trans in the latest census count.",
      "The feminist groups who led the legal challenge cheered the ruling and others, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, welcomed the clarity it brought.",
      "\"Everyone knows what sex is and you can't change it,\" said Susan Smith, co-director of For Women Scotland, which brought the case.",
      "A difficult decision",
      "Washington, who leads the group Football v Transphobia, was one of 28 transgender women registered with the Football Association to play amateur soccer. In order to play the women's game, they had to have testosterone levels reduced to the range of biologically born females.",
      "After the ruling, the organization changed its rules, saying that although it had aimed to make soccer accessible to as many people as possible, it was always prepared to alter its policy if there were changes in the law or science.",
      "\"We understand that this will be difficult for people who simply want to play the game they love in the gender by which they identify,\" the FA said, adding that it would contact transgender women currently playing to explain the changes and how they can remain involved.",
      "Some clubs have responded by finding ways around the ban. Goal Diggers FC, a women and nonbinary inclusive soccer club based in London, has withdrawn from all FA-affiliated leagues.",
      "On June 1, the day the ban took effect, Goal Diggers hosted an inclusive women's tournament in London, drawing more than 100 players in a show of solidarity.",
      "\"I'll always have a place here and I'll always be a trans woman,\" said Billie Sky, a 28-year-old trans player for Goal Diggers. \"No one can take that away from me.\"",
      "Other voices, other sports",
      "Groups that have campaigned to keep trans athletes from girls' and women's teams, citing a matter of safety and fairness, welcomed the move by the FA.",
      "\"The FA had ample evidence of the harms to women and girls caused by its nonsensical policy of letting men who identify as women play in women's teams,\" said Fiona McAnena of Sex Matters.",
      "Groups that oversee cricket and netball, an offshoot of basketball that is played mainly by women, also limited women's competition to those who were assigned at birth as females.",
      "The England and Wales Cricket Board said transgender women and girls could continue playing in open and mixed cricket. England Netball said it would allow anyone to play in a new mixed category beginning in September.",
      "How the ruling came about",
      "The legal case involved a 2018 Scottish law requiring at least half of the seats on public boards to be held by women. Trans women with certificates recognizing their gender were to be included in meeting the quota.",
      "The court said that using the certificates to identify someone's gender clashes with the definitions of man and woman. Under the ruling, a transgender person could not claim they had been discriminated against if barred from a single-sex space.",
      "Alexander Maine, a senior lecturer at The City Law School specializing in gender, sexuality and law, said the ruling clouds the value of a document sanctioned by the U.K. Gender Recognition Act that allows them to later update their birth certificate reflecting their acquired gender.",
      "\"There may be a challenge at the European Court of Human Rights brought by trans individuals who say that there is a problem where they may be two sexes at once,\" Maine said.",
      "Someone could hold \"a gender recognition certificate stating that they are their acquired gender, whereas under the U.K. Equality Act, they are still recognized in their birth gender,\" he said.",
      "Washington and many others say they worry the ruling may lead to more hatred aimed at trans people.",
      "\"For the first time in a long time, I felt scared about how people are going to react to me in public,\" Washington said. \"I don't feel anymore that I can guarantee I have support to turn to from authorities.\""

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/thailand-prime-minister-suspended-leaked-phone-call-cambodia-official-rcna216151",
    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 08:26:09 GMT",
    "summary": "A Thai court suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office Tuesday pending investigation over a leaked phone call with a senior Cambodian leader.",
    "story": [
      "BANGKOK \u2014 Thailand's Constitutional Court suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday, pending an ethics investigation over accusations that she was too deferential to a senior Cambodian leader when the two discussed a recent border dispute in a phone call that was leaked.",
      "Paetongtarn has faced growing dissatisfaction over her handling of the dispute, which involved an armed confrontation on May 28, in which one Cambodian soldier was killed. In a call with Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen, she attempted to defuse tensions \u2014 but instead set off a string of complaints and public protests by critics who accused her of being too fawning.",
      "Familiar pattern",
      "Paetongtarn's suspension raises the possibility of renewed instability in Thailand, a still fragile democracy that has suffered several similar bouts of uncertainty. At the root of much of that were concerns from the conservative establishment, including the military, that the political dynasty started by Paetongtarn's father, the popular but divisive former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was growing too powerful.",
      "She is the third member of her family to hold the prime minister's office \u2014 and the third to face the possibility of removal before her term ended. Thaksin was removed from office in a 2006 coup and driven into exile, while his sister, former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawtra, was removed by a court order in 2014, followed shortly after by a coup.",
      "This \"recurring cycle of political instability\" would likely keep repeating unless Thailand goes through a genuine democratic reform that includes limiting power of unelected institutions, said Purawich Watanasukh, a political science lecturer at Thammasat University in Bangkok.",
      "\"Without such foundational reforms, any government, regardless of who leads it, will remain vulnerable to the same forces that have repeatedly disrupted Thailand's democratic development,\" he said.",
      "Growing discontent",
      "The suspension also comes at a time when the country is facing an economic slowdown and growing discontent with Paetongtarn and her Pheu Thai party, in general, with critics saying her government's performance has been underwhelming.",
      "The judges voted unanimously Tuesday to review the petition accusing her of a breach of the ethics, and voted 7-2 to immediately suspend her from duty as a prime minister until a ruling is given. The court gave Paetongtarn 15 days to give evidence to support her case.",
      "After the court order, Paetongtarn said that she would accept the process and defended her actions.",
      "\"I only thought about what to do to avoid troubles, what to do to avoid armed confrontation, for the soldiers not to suffer any loss,\" she said.",
      "She also apologized to people upset over the leaked call and left the Government House shortly after.",
      "Suriya Jungrungruangkit, who is a deputy prime minister and a transport minister, will take charge as acting prime minister, said Chousak Sirinil, minister of the prime minister's office.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, before the court suspended Paetongtarn, King Maha Vajiralongkorn had endorsed a Cabinet reshuffle after a major party left the government coalition over the leaked call.",
      "In the reshuffle, Paetongtarn also received the position of culture minister, in addition to prime minister, though it's not clear if she can take the oath to take up that role.",
      "In the call about the border tensions, Paetongtarn could be heard urging Hun Sen \u2014 a longtime friend of her father \u2014 not to listen to a Thai regional army commander who had publicly criticized Cambodia about the border dispute, and called him \"an opponent.\"",
      "Thousands of conservative, nationalist-leaning protesters rallied in central Bangkok on Saturday to demand Paetongtarn's resignation.",
      "Paetongtarn also faces separate investigations by another agency over the leaked call \u2014 a case that could also lead to her removal.",
      "The Constitutional Court last year removed Paetongtarn's predecessor over a breach of ethics. Thailand's courts, especially the Constitutional Court, are viewed as a defender of the royalist establishment, which has used them and nominally independent agencies such as the Election Commission to cripple or sink political opponents.",
      "Fallout from leaked call",
      "Paetongtarn, 38, is the youngest daughter of Thaksin. Her father has remained beloved by many of the Thailand's poor and working classes who long saw him as their champion.",
      "But the family's political fortunes now may be on the wane.",
      "Thaksin alienated many of his supporters with what looked like a self-serving deal with his former conservative opponents. It allowed his return from exile in 2023 and the party he supported to form the new government, while sidelining the progressive Move Forward Party, which finished first in a national election, but was seen by the conservative establishment as a greater threat.",
      "Thaksin has faced several legal challenges since his return. On Tuesday, he attended a court hearing in a case alleging he defamed the monarchy in 2015.",
      "He also is under investigation over the handling of his return to face an eight-year prison term on charges related to corruption and abuse of power. At the time, he was transferred almost immediately to a hospital, and later granted clemency because of his age and health without spending a single night in jail.",
      "The complaints argue he avoided properly serving his sentence and raise the possibility that Thaksin could be forced to serve prison time."

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 Dozens of Israeli settlers rampaged around a military base in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, setting fires, vandalizing military vehicles, spraying graffiti and attacking soldiers, the military said.",
      "Sunday night's unrest came after several attacks in the West Bank carried out by Jewish settlers and anger at their arrests by security forces attempting to contain the violence over the past few days.",
      "More than 100 settlers on Wednesday evening entered the West Bank town of Kfar Malik, setting property ablaze and opening fire on Palestinians who tried to stop them, Najeb Rostom, head of the local council, said. Three Palestinians were killed after the military intervened. Israeli security forces arrested five settlers.",
      "Far-right Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has often defended Israelis accused of similar crimes, offered a rare condemnation of Sunday's violence. \"Attacking security forces, security facilities, and IDF soldiers who are our brothers, our protectors, is a red line, and must be dealt with in full severity. We are brothers,\" he wrote on X.",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid told Israel's Army radio that the riots were carried out by \"Jewish terrorists, gangs of criminals, who feel backed by the (governing) coalition.\"",
      "A hard-line supporter of Jewish settlements, Ben-Gvir was previously convicted in Israel of racist incitement and support for terrorist groups, and has called for the deportation of all Arab citizens from Israel. Though once widely shunned by Israel's politicians, Ben-Gvir's influence has grown and alongside a shift to the right in the country's electorate has further emboldened violence from extremist settlers in the West Bank.",
      "Footage on Israeli media showed dozens of young, religious men typically associated with \" hilltop youth,\" an extremist movement of Israeli settlers who occupy West Bank hilltops and have been accused of attacking Palestinians and their property. The footage showed security forces using stun grenades as dozens of settlers gathered around the military base just north of Ramallah. The Israeli military released photos of the infrastructure burned in the attack, which it said included \"systems that help thwart terrorist attacks and maintain security.\"",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed Monday to \"eradicate this violence from the root,\" and implored the extremist settlers to remember that many of the security forces are exhausted reservists serving multiple rounds of duty.",
      "Over the past two years of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Palestinian residents in the West Bank have reported a major increase in Israeli checkpoints and delays across the territory. Israel, meanwhile, says threats from the West Bank against its citizens are on the rise.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, and Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. The West Bank is home to some 3 million Palestinians who live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, and 500,000 Jewish settlers. The international community overwhelmingly considers settlements illegal."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/world/australia/australia-mushroom-poisoning-case-verdict-due-murder-trial-rcna215888",

    "summary": "A jury in Australia began deliberations in the trial of Erin Patterson, accused of killing her husband's relatives by  serving them poisonous mushrooms.",
    "story": [
      "A sequestered jury in Australia began deliberations Monday in the triple murder trial of Erin Patterson, accused of killing her estranged husband's relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch.",
      "Three of Patterson's four lunch guests \u2014 her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson \u2014 died in the hospital after the 2023 meal at her home in Leongatha, at which she served individual beef Wellington pastries containing death cap mushrooms.",
      "She is accused of attempting to murder the fourth, Heather's husband Ian Wilkinson, who was gravely ill but survived.",
      "During the nine-week Supreme Court trial in the state of Victoria, Patterson gave evidence in her own defense. The 50-year-old mother of two faces life in prison if convicted.",
      "Jury must decide if mushroom cook meant to kill",
      "It isn't disputed that Patterson served her guests the toxic mushrooms or that the meal killed them. But the jury must decide whether she meant for them to die.",
      "Prosecutors in the case, which has gripped Australia for two years, said the accused woman researched, foraged and served the mushrooms deliberately and lied to investigators to cover her tracks. Their case against Patterson included that she disposed of a food dehydrator after the fatal meal and reset her phone multiple times.",
      "The prosecution said she lied about having a dire medical diagnosis to ensure her guests attended the lunch, cooked individual pastries to avoid poisoning herself, and faked symptoms to make it look as though she fell ill, too.",
      "But Patterson's lawyers said the poisoning was a terrible accident caused by a pantry mix-up of store-bought and wild mushrooms, which she didn't know were death caps. The defense case was that Patterson wasn't as ill as the other diners because she induced vomiting after the meal due to an eating disorder.",
      "The accused lied to the police that she had never foraged mushrooms or owned a dehydrator out of panic, her lawyers said. Patterson denied telling her lunch guests she had a confirmed diagnosis of cancer.",
      "Prosecutors offered no motive",
      "Justice Christopher Beale spent four days summarizing the case to jurors before their deliberations began, urging them not to be swayed by bias or prejudice, or by sympathy for the families of those who died. Patterson's lies, some of which she admitted during her evidence, could be used to assess her credibility but didn't mean she was guilty of murder, Justice Beale said.",
      "Prosecutors didn't offer a motive for the alleged killings and weren't required to. But they suggested a deteriorating relationship between the accused and her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, as well as her exasperation with her former in-laws, which she expressed to friends on social media months before the deaths.",
      "The defense said Erin Patterson had a positive and loving relationship with her lunch guests, who included her children's only living grandparents, and that she had no reason to kill them. Justice Beale highlighted in his summary of the case the fleeting and minor nature of the past disputes.",
      "Simon Patterson was invited to the fatal lunch but didn't go.",
      "Jurors will remain sequestered",
      "A 14-member jury heard the case, but 12 were selected by ballot Monday to decide the verdict. The jury will remain sequestered, meaning they will stay together in court-appointed accommodation until they reach a unanimous decision.",
      "Late Monday afternoon, court staff told reporters that jurors had finished deliberations for the day and would return to consider the case Tuesday. The jury is not permitted to return a verdict outside of the court's sitting hours and members are barred from discussing the case outside the jury room \u2014 even with each other.",
      "Sequestration is rare in Australia and reflects public and media fervor about the case, with several news outlets publishing live blogs that covered every moment of the trial for its more than two-month run. The lengthy fixture in the town of Morwell, Victoria, drew lines of people eager to watch proceedings each day."
