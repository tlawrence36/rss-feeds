      "Prosecutors are urging a New York federal judge to send music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs to prison for over 11 years",
      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors urged a New York federal judge Tuesday to send Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs to prison for over 11 years following his conviction on prostitution-related charges, citing one of his accusers who said she lives in fear of the music mogul's release from detention.",
      "\u201cHis crimes of conviction are serious and have warranted sentences over ten years in multiple cases for defendants who, like Sean Combs, engaged in violence and put others in fear,\u201d they wrote in a presentence submission requesting at least 11 years and three months in prison.",
      "They filed their sentencing recommendation shortly after midnight, including letters from some of his accusers describing how his violence and demands had impacted their lives.",
      "They called Combs \u201cunrepentant\u201d and said Combs had conceded his acts of violence and abuse throughout his trial but \u201cincredibly, ... he now argues that his victims should shoulder the blame.\u201d",
      "Combs, 55, has remained jailed since his July conviction on charges related to arranging male sex workers to travel to hotels or residences where he directed them to have sex with his girlfriends.",
      "The elaborate dayslong, drug-fueled sexual events were often filmed by Combs. Defense attorneys have asked that he be sentenced to no more than 14 months in prison. Sentencing is set for Friday.",
      "In July, Combs was convicted of two charges for violating the Mann Act, which outlaws interstate commerce related to prostitution, for arranging the paid sexual encounters between his girlfriends and male sex workers. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.",
      "The same jury acquitted the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that could have resulted in a life sentence.",
      "Last week, the defense submitted its presentence arguments, saying Combs has suffered enough during his nearly 13 months behind bars that he should be freed soon.",
      "They wrote that he became a changed man in a Brooklyn federal lockup, where he has been under constant suicide watch and learned to react calmly to threats rather than violently, even when a fellow inmate confronted him with a shiv.",
      "They said Combs has realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in.",
      "Prosecutors said Combs was now trying to cast himself as a victim.",
      "\u201cHe is not the victim,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe Court should focus on the very real effects that the defendant\u2019s conduct had on the lives of the actual victims, his victims.\u201d",

Another ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym \u201cJane,\u201d said she felt pressured to perform sexually with male sex workers. She testified that an enraged Combs once put her in a chokehold and punched her in the face.",
      "In a letter accompanying the prosecutors' submission, Cassie wrote that she testified while nine months pregnant during Combs' trial \u201cin front of a packed courtroom about the most traumatic and horrifying chapter in my life. I testified that from age nineteen, Sean Combs used violence, threats, substances, and control over my career to trap me in over a decade of abuse.\u201d",
      "Cassie wrote that Combs controlled her like a puppet.",
      "\u201cThese events were degrading and disgusting, leaving me with infections, illnesses, and days of physical and emotional exhaustion before he demanded it all again. Sex acts became my full-time job, used as the only way to stay in his good graces,\u201d she said.",
      "Cassie said she still has nightmares and flashbacks on an everyday basis and requires psychological care to cope.",
      "\u201cMy worries that Sean Combs or his associates will come after me and my family is my reality. I have in fact moved my family out of the New York area and am keeping as private and quiet as I possibly can because I am so scared that if he walks free, his first actions will be swift retribution towards me and others who spoke up about his abuse at trial,\u201d Cassie said.",
      "The AP does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has.",
      "In an indictment, prosecutors asserted that Combs used his fame, wealth and violence to force and manipulate Cassie and Jane, now-ex-girlfriends, into the sexual performances he called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "After Combs was convicted, Judge Arun Subramanian immediately refused a defense request to grant him bail.",

    "story": [
      "New rules that limit the access of journalists in the Pentagon and appear to condition entry into the building on agreement to restrictions have led to a standoff between the press and the Trump administration's defense department",
      "Journalists who cover the Pentagon and the Trump admnistration are in a standoff about new rules that limit the access of the media to most areas within the Pentagon and appear to condition overall entry to the building on an agreement to restrictions in reporting.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's team characterizes the changes as an effort to protect national security and the safety of those who work at the Pentagon, while many in the press see it as an effort to exert control and avoid embarrassing stories.",
      "Journalists who want to hold on to badges that permit access to the Pentagon were told on Sept. 19 they must sign a letter acknowledging the new rules by this Tuesday or the badge \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d The new policy says that Defense Department information \u201cmust be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if unclassified.\u201d Classified material faces even tighter restrictions.",
      "That level of control immediately alarmed journalists and their advocates.",
      "\u201cAsking independent journalists to submit to these kinds of restrictions is at stark odds with the constitutional protections of a free press in a democracy, and a continued attempt to throttle the public's right to understand what their government is doing,\u201d said Charles Stadtlander, spokesman for The New York Times.",
      "In a subsequent letter to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Hegseth aide Sean Parnell suggested that journalists misunderstood some of the new rules. He said, for example, that the restriction against releasing unclassified information is the policy that Pentagon officials must follow \u2014 not something the journalists must abide by.",
      "\u201cIt should come as no surprise that the mainstream media is once again misrepresenting the Pentagon's press procedures,\u201d Parnell said in a post on X. \u201cLet's be absolutely clear: Journalists are not required to clear their stories with us. That claim is a lie.\u201d",
      "However, the new policy says that journalists who encourage Pentagon officials to break the rules \u2014 in other words, ask sources for information \u2014 could be subject to losing their building access.",
      "While it appeared that Parnell sought to soften some of the hard edges of his policy in response to questions raised by the reporters' committee, there's still enough confusion to merit a meeting to clear things up, said Grayson Clary, a lawyer for RCFP. There's some wariness among news organizations about what they would be agreeing to if they sign the letter, and it's not clear how many people \u2014 if any \u2014 have done so.",
      "The new rules continue a tense relationship between the press and the Hegseth team, which had already evicted some news outlets from their regular workspaces in favor of friendlier outlets and limited the ability of reporters to roam around the Pentagon. Hegseth and Parnell seldom hold press briefings.",
      "Parnell did not respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt's control, just 100% control,\u201d said Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine. Goldberg, who is not stationed at the Pentagon, wrote the most embarrassing story of Hegseth's tenure so far when he was inadvertently included in a Signal group chat where Hegseth and other national officials discussed an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen. The brouhaha became widely known as \u201cSignalgate.\u201d",
      "Pentagon leadership was also reportedly unhappy over a story that said Elon Musk was to get a briefing on military strategy for China, leading President Donald Trump to stop it, and other stories about initial assessments of damage in the military strike against Iran.",
      "No American reporter accredited to the Pentagon that he knows is interested in subverting national security or putting anyone in the military in harm's way, Goldberg said.",
      "In his own case, Goldberg did not report on what he learned until after the attack was over. He said he contacted officials in the group chat to ask if there was anything he learned that was harmful to the country in any way. He did not include in his story the name of a CIA official mentioned in the messages who was technically still undercover, he said.",
      "\u201cThe only people in Signalgate who were putting American troops in harm's way were the national leadership of the United States by discussing on a commercial messaging app the launch times of strikes on a hostile country,\u201d he said.",

With the exception of a few areas, reporters are not permitted under the new rules to walk through the Pentagon without an official escort.",
      "Priest said the corridors of the Pentagon were like areas around Congress where reporters buttonhole politicians. Priest recalled staking out military officials waiting for them to come out of a bathroom.",
      "\u201cThey know the goal of the media is to get around the official gobbledygook and get out the truth,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThey may not help you. But some of them want to help Americans know what is going on.\u201d",
      "Experienced national security reporters know there are many ways to get information, including through other channels of government and people in the private sector. \u201cThe Pentagon is always very well versed in the advantages of controlling the story, so they always try to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reporters know that. They've known that for decades.\u201d",
      "Reporters who don\u2019t follow the new rules won\u2019t necessarily be expelled immediately, Parnell told the reporter\u2019s committee. But access will be determined by Hegseth\u2019s team.",
      "While reporters already stationed in the Pentagon were given until Sept. 30 to sign, they were allowed to request an additional five days for legal review.",
      "Although the Times, Washington Post and Atlantic all put out statements against the Pentagon's plan, none of the publications would say what they have recommended that their reporters do \u2014 perhaps an indication that they consider negotiations potentially fruitful.",
      "President Donald Trump hasn't hesitated to fight the media when he thinks he's been wronged, launching lawsuits against CBS News, ABC News, The Wall Street Journal and the Times. Yet he's also frequently accessible to the press, more so than many of his predecessors, and there has been some uncertainty in the White House about the Pentagon's policy.",
      "When a reporter asked, \u201cshould the Pentagon be in charge of deciding what reporters can report on?\u201d the president replied, \u201cNo, I don't think so. Listen, nothing stops reporters. You know that.\u201d",
      "Goldberg noted that it's more than just an issue for reporters. \u201cThe American people have a right to know what the world's most powerful military does in their name and with their money,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seems fairly obvious to me.\u201d",

      "Bad Bunny has been chosen to headline the Super Bowl halftime show, marking a significant moment for Latin identity on a major stage",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The selection of Bad Bunny to headline the Super Bowl halftime show is about more than music.",
      "The move signals a cultural spotlight for Latin identity at America\u2019s most-watched television event. It also raises fresh questions about how much space there will be for his trademark symbolism and social commentary \u2014 including his past criticism of President Donald Trump \u2014 given the NFL's history of keeping performances tightly managed.",
      "Here are some things to know about the selection.",
      "The halftime show is a collaboration between the NFL, Roc Nation and Apple Music.",
      "Roc Nation, Jay-Z\u2019s entertainment company, has curated performers since 2019 and returns alongside veteran producer Jesse Collins. Apple Music distributes the performance, while the NFL ultimately controls the stage, broadcast and branding.",
      "Artists don\u2019t get a paycheck for performing. However, their payoff is global exposure. That imbalance gives the league leverage, though history shows that high-powered stars sometimes defy the league\u2019s guardrails.",
      "The NFL has a track record of pushing back when artists get political. However, some performers don't always comply.",
      "\u2022 In 2020, the league asked Jennifer Lopez to cut a segment featuring children in cages, a critique of U.S. immigration policies. She refused.",
      "\u2022 In 2022, it was reported that Dr. Dre and Eminem were both advised not to kneel or reference police, but they went forward.",
      "\u2022 Rapper M.I.A. flashed a middle finger during Madonna\u2019s set, earning a hefty fine in 2012. She and the NFL ultimately reached a settlement ending their multimillion dollar dispute a couple years later.",
      "While Bad Bunny is a known hitmaker, he\u2019s also an artist who ties his music to Puerto Rican identity, colonial politics and immigrant struggles. His Super Bowl announcement included a pointed dedication: \u201cThis is for my people, my culture, and our history.\u201d",
      "That alone sets the stage for a performance that could carry layered meanings far beyond spectacle.",
      "In his career, Bad Bunny has become one of the world\u2019s most streamed artists with albums such as \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti,\u201d an all-Spanish-language record.",
      "The 31-year-old artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has won three Grammys and 12 Latin Grammys. He has become a global ambassador for Latin music, starred in films such as \u201cBullet Train,\u201d \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d and \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d and collaborated with top fashion houses. He enters November's Latin Grammys as the leading nominee with 12, dethroning producer and songwriter \u00c9dgar Barrera.",
      "Bad Bunny has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. In the final weeks of the 2024 campaign, he backed former Vice President Kamala Harris after a comedian at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally mocked Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "Days later, Bad Bunny posted a video showcasing Puerto Rico\u2019s beaches and artists, captioned simply: \u201cgarbage.\u201d",
      "Since Trump took office, Bad Bunny's criticism hasn\u2019t slowed. This year, he shared an Instagram video appearing to show immigration agents making arrests in Puerto Rico, with the voice behind the camera cursing the agents.",

      "Trump has a long history of inserting politics into sports. He\u2019s pushed for the late Pete Rose\u2019s Hall of Fame induction, threatened to block Washington\u2019s new stadium deal if the team didn\u2019t restore its old name, and frequently used sporting events as political platforms.",
      "The moves are part of his broader efforts to shape the country\u2019s cultural mood, weighing in on entertainers and companies alike. He blasted late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, whose show briefly faced suspension after the Trump administration signaled potential repercussions following remarks in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination.",
      "He also revived his long-running feud with Rosie O\u2019Donnell, saying earlier this year that he was considering \u201ctaking away\u201d her U.S. citizenship after she criticized his proposed spending cuts.",
      "And just last month, Trump inserted himself into the backlash over Cracker Barrel\u2019s new logo, posting on Truth Social that the company should stick with its old design. When the chain reversed course, he celebrated the decision as a personal victory.",
      "For Bad Bunny, the halftime show is the ultimate stage to showcase his music, heritage and global influence. For the NFL and Apple Music, it\u2019s a balancing act: deliver a spectacle that celebrates diversity without igniting controversy that scares off advertisers.",
      "If Bad Bunny leans strictly into spectacle, the moment could be historic for Latin music. If he threads in political symbolism, it could become one of the most dissected halftime performances in Super Bowl history.",

      "\u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s widely acclaimed American epic of rebellion and resistance, opened with $22.4 million in ticket sales from North American theaters over the weekend",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s widely acclaimed American epic of rebellion and resistance, opened with $22.4 million in ticket sales from North American theaters over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Anderson\u2019s ultracontemporary opus signifies a major gamble by Warner Bros. With \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d the studio is making a $130 million-plus bet that audiences would come out for 170-minute-long powerhouse drama from one of cinema\u2019s most celebrated auteurs the way they usually only turn up for a franchise or superhero movie.",
      "Anderson, many critics said, delivered the movie of year. \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor and Sean Penn, has been hailed as a film brimming with many of the political conflicts of today. Oscar prognosticators have pegged it this year\u2019s best-picture front-runner. Aided by DiCaprio\u2019s drawing power, the film added $26.1 million overseas.",
      "But good reviews, star power and a marquee filmmaker are nowadays often insufficient to make a hit. For a movie that cost at least $130 million to make, plus many millions more to market, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will have a long road to reach profitability. For most releases with such a high budget, a $22.4 million start would be a disappointment.",
      "Executives for Warner Bros. declined to be interviewed about the opening.",
      "Yet \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d like movies from earlier movie eras, will hope its time in theaters is more about the long run than opening weekend. Warners is hoping word-of-mouth, awards conversation and a rolling awareness that \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is a major movie event, will keep ticket sales strong in the weeks, or even months, to come.",
      "Some signs suggest that\u2019s possible. Audiences gave \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore. That\u2019s far better than CinemaScores for previous Anderson wide releases, including 1997\u2019s \u201cBoogie Nights\u201d (\u201cC\u201d), 1999\u2019s \u201cMagnolia\u201d (\u201cC-\u201d) and 2002\u2019s \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d (\u201cD+).",
      "\u201cThe long-term playability is going to be key for this,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cAnd given the outpouring of support by critics and audiences, alike, that's where it's going to make back its budget.\u201d",
      "Yet as highly regarded as Anderson is, his films have rarely made a big impact at the box office. His biggest hit was 2007\u2019s \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d which collected $76.4 million worldwide.",
      "For Warner Bros., \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d marked its ninth movie this year to open No. 1, more than any other studio. That success \u2014 with $4 billion in global sales \u2014 has included some refreshingly original films that haven\u2019t always made their most obvious way into theaters.",
      "Warners released Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners\u201d in April, and it went on to gross $366.7 million worldwide. \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d chose to opt out of the usual fall festival platforms for prestige films, and first screened while most critics were in Venice or Toronto. Yet \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will likely be favorites for many of the same prizes in the coming awards season.",
      "Anderson\u2019s film, loosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cVineland,\u201d stars DiCaprio as a former revolutionary living off the grid with his teenage daughter (Chase Infiniti). Shot in VistaVision, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d played in several large-screen formats, including 70mm, IMAX, 70mm and, on four screens, in VistaVision.",
      "Second place went \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie.\u201d The Universal Pictures release, produced by DreamWorks Animation, grossed $13.5 million in 3,500 theaters. It\u2019s a good start for the G-rated film, based on the long-running series. \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie,\u201d which cost $32 million to make, also earned an \u201cA+\u201d CinemaScore from audiences.",

      "NEW YORK -- Taylor Heine, 35, is often multitasking when she watches TV shows or movies at home. \u201cI\u2019ll be playing on the phone, loving on my animals, maybe cleaning, picking up,\u201d she says.",
      "So she watches with the subtitles turned on.",
      "\u201cThat way I can kind of switch back and forth, be able to listen to it or look back at the screen and I know what\u2019s going on, Heine says.\u201d She can also catch up if she misses a piece of dialogue.",

      "\"When he\u2019s cooking or banging around in the kitchen, that way I don\u2019t have to blare the TV,\" she says.",
      "Closed captions or subtitles can be an acquired taste. Some people find them distracting, and even family members in the same household can be in disagreement, resulting in tussles for the remote. But Heine, who lives in Johnson City, Tennessee, is in good company, according to a new survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research: People under age 45 are more likely to use them than older adults.",
      "The poll finds that about 4 in 10 adults under 45 use subtitles at least \u201coften\u201d when watching TV or movies, compared with about 3 in 10 adults older than 45. Those 60 and older are especially likely to say they \u201cnever\u201d use subtitles.",
      "The poll suggests many young adults use subtitles because they are watching in noisy environments, whereas older adults choose them to better hear or understand what is being said.",
      "That makes sense to David Barber, a sound editor and mixer and president of the Motion Picture Sound Editors.",
      "\u201cPart of it is cultural,\u201d Barber says. \u201cWhat the younger kids are doing is, a lot of them will multitask. They\u2019ll listen to music while they\u2019re watching a show. So they\u2019re catching bits and pieces of this, bits and pieces of that. I think they probably are half-listening and half-watching. It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon.\u201d",
      "Many people, regardless of age, use closed captions simply to better catch dialogue.",
      "Most subtitle-users, 55%, say they use closed captions because they want to catch every word. About 4 in 10 say they do so because of difficulty understanding accents or because they are watching a foreign movie or show.",
      "Ariaunna Davis, 21, says she typically uses subtitles if she is in an environment where she cannot hear the audio and does not want to blast the volume, or if she cannot understand a character\u2019s accent.",
      "\u201cIf I want to know most of the words that are being said and the audio\u2019s a bit iffy, then that\u2019s the moment I\u2019ll mostly use captions,\u201d she says.",
      "Adrian Alaniz, 31, of Midland, Texas, thinks his hearing was slightly damaged by the concerts he attended when he was younger. With subtitles, he can be sure he is understanding what is going on, particularly if he is eating something crunchy like a bag of chips.",
      "In the animated shows Alaniz watches, the subtitles are particularly helpful for translation. There have been times, he says, when dubbed audio and subtitles do not match. \u201cSometimes the audio doesn\u2019t come across as clearly and the subtitles do help in that matter,\u201d he says.",
      "The poll found that about 3 in 10 U.S. adults use subtitles because they are watching in a noisy environment, while roughly one-quarter say they do so because of poor audio quality.",

      "Paul Thomas Anderson has spent about 20 years writing \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Paul Thomas Anderson spent about 20 years writing \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d After two decades, it\u2019s never felt more relevant.",
      "The epic action thriller, inspired by Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cVineland,\u201d hits theaters Friday. With a running time of 2 hours and 50 minutes, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d wastes no time immersing audiences in its politically charged world.",
      "The revolution will not be televised, but it will be placed at the front and center of Anderson\u2019s film. The director isn\u2019t there to make his audience comfortable, star Teyana Taylor says, as he zeros in on themes of immigration, racism and systemic corruption showcased at their most absurd.",
      "\u201cI feel like PTA calls out a lot of things that are trying to get swept under the rug,\u201d Taylor told The Associated Press, referring to the director by his nickname. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I respect. This is really waking, shaking and baking some s---. Like, you gotta shake the table.\u201d",
      "Taylor\u2019s character, Perfidia Beverly Hills, is a member of the Weather Underground-inspired French 75 revolutionary group. From the film\u2019s first scene, we see the French 75 take matters into their own hands, liberating undocumented detainees, destroying corrupt political offices and launching their own form of justice, one right after the other. The group is peppered with members portrayed by musicians-turned-actors like Dijon Duenas, Alana Haim, and Shayna McHayle and notable actors like Regina Hall and Wood Harris.",
      "\u201cI mean, this movie is based on some of the revolutionaries and anarchists of the late '60s, the Weathermen that were fighting for civil rights, environmentalism too at the time, capitalism, Vietnam,\u201d star Leonardo DiCaprio told the AP. \u201cBut it\u2019s about the implosion of that too, about the extremes that people go to for their own ideology.\u201d",
      "DiCaprio portrays Bob Ferguson, known in the French 75\u2019s initial scenes as Ghetto Pat, known for his knowledge of explosives and undying devotion to both Perfidia and the revolution. Together, Perfidia and Pat seem unstoppable, until the racist and xenophobic Col. Steven Lockjaw (Sean Penn) sets out end the group to fuel his rise to power.",
      "\u201cAnd this is a movie, fast-forward, in today\u2019s day and age, where you see this sort of systematic breakdown that comes from it, if it\u2019s not done with grace and purity and consistently, the whole sort of\u2014 our revolution is dismantled and our past comes back to haunt us,\u201d said DiCaprio. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I love that Paul did. He shows extremity on both sides of the spectrum and how no one seems to be communicating or getting things done in the right way nowadays.\u201d",
      "The film jumps 16 years into the future. Perfidia has disappeared and DiCaprio\u2019s character lives under a new alias in a sanctuary city as a paranoid, stoner dad with his teenage daughter, Willa (newcomer Chase Infiniti). Everything is seemingly mundane until Lockjaw reappears, forcing the father-daughter duo on the run.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of moments where I was like, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m gonna be able to do this, but thankfully I had amazing scene partners and a great support system to kind of assure me that I was here to do my job and I knew exactly that I could do it,\u201d Infiniti said.",
      "\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is Anderson\u2019s most expensive project to date and shot entirely in VistaVision \u2014 a decades-old format that's been revived in recent years by movies like \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",

      "Reactions might differ about the choices Simon (Goldstein) and Laura (Imogen Poots) make in the film, which is a kind of rom-com-dram, if you will. But one thing Goldstein has noticed is that a lot of people who see it think that it\u2019s about them.",
      "\u201cI think everyone has this friendship,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s someone in their life that is not their partner that they have a connection that feels more than friends, but what is that? What is love? And does it take away from the other? We just wanted to explore all of that over time.\u201d",
      "The idea came out of a getting to know you conversation with William Bridges, an Emmy winner for \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d whose episodes include \u201cUSS Callister.\" He co-wrote the film with Goldstein, and directed. At the time of the chat, Goldstein was single. Bridges was not. And Goldstein asked him if the woman he was seeing was \u201cthe one.\u201d It got them thinking about the idea of a soulmate test, something that could just take all the guesswork, all the bad dates, all the lost time, out of the equation.",
      "\u201cAll of You\u201d begins with a moment of truth as Simon accompanies Laura, his best friend from university, on her way to take the test. He even pays for it, and soon enough she\u2019s off making plans with a husband to be.",
      "Though the film has a bit of a science fiction element to it, it\u2019s decidedly less dystopian than a \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Some, like Laura, take the test. Some, like Simon, try to do it the old-fashioned way. But many are left wondering if they made the right choice. The film is told linearly, but skips over months and sometimes years in the saga of Laura and Simon.",

But I\u2019m not quite sure that that\u2019s the experience of love that a lot of people have,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking for love stories rather than romance stories.\u201d",

      "Alessandro Dell'Acqua's No. 21 collection for next spring and summer focuses on lightness",
      "MILAN -- Alessandro Dell'Acqua's No. 21 collection for next spring and summer, presented Wednesday during Milan Fashion Week, is a study in lightness, as a hedge against the heavy times.",
      "\u201cI believe that in moments of heaviness and uncertainty, sometimes taking a moment of lightheartedness and clearing your mind a bit can be good for you,'' Dell'Acqua said backstage. \u201dThis is why I made it so light.\"",
      "Nowhere was the concept more at play than in chiffon petal cutouts that were sewn together in ruffles on dresses, or as a collar around the neck, rustling delicately with the movement. Dell'Acqua also created wilted flowers out of chiffon that he pinned on garments, \u201cas if forgotten by time.\u201d",
      "The lightness allowed Dell'Acqua to layer amply. Plaid kilts were underpinned by petticoat layers. Prairie skirts with a big hem ruffle were tied prettily at the waist. Silken slip dresses were worn one atop the other.",

      "The Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases in the last five years that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people\u2019s federal food benefits",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A single mother who relied on federal food assistance lost her benefits in 2020 after Kentucky investigators concluded she\u2019d committed fraud.",
      "The state alleged she had made multiple same-day purchases, tried to overdraw her account a few times, entered a few invalid PINs and sometimes made \u201cwhole-dollar\u201d purchases that are unlikely during typical grocery runs.",
      "The woman from Salyersville in Appalachian Kentucky had an explanation: She worked at the store. She would sometimes buy lunch there and then get groceries after work. Her child would also occasionally use her card.",
      "An administrative hearing officer kicked her off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) regardless, based solely on the allegedly suspicious shopping pattern. She sued \u2014 and won.",
      "\u201cIt is draconian to take away SNAP benefits from a single mother without clear and convincing evidence that intentional trafficking was occurring during a time when food scarcity is so prevalent,\u201d Franklin County Judge Thomas Wingate said in his 2023 decision.",
      "Over the last five years, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people\u2019s food benefits.",
      "Judges, lawyers and legal experts said in interviews and in court documents that such evidence proves little. Kentucky Public Radio reviewed dozens of administrative hearing decisions and court documents from the last five years in which the cabinet relied on shopping patterns to prove a person had \u201ctrafficked,\u201d or sold, their benefits.",
      "Kentucky is so aggressive in disqualifying people from SNAP benefits that the state is second in the nation for per-capita administrative disqualifications, behind Florida, according to the most recent federal data from 2023.",
      "In the last decade, disqualifications in Kentucky rose from fewer than 100 in 2015 to over 1,800 in 2023. And more than 300 others have been accused of selling or misusing their benefits since January 2024, according to records obtained by Kentucky Public Radio.",
      "Another Franklin County judge in 2023 ordered the cabinet to stop disqualifying individuals based solely on transactional data, but since the decision, at least three lawsuits allege the health agency continues to bring such cases.",
      "Transactional data alone cannot prove intent to commit fraud nor show the actual result of any individual transaction, University of Kentucky law professor Cory Dodds said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that folks didn\u2019t do it, didn\u2019t commit the fraud, but I don\u2019t think the cabinet in a lot of these cases has met their burden of proof, either.\u201d",
      "Kentuckians receive notice of their alleged suspicious activity through mailed letters, in which they\u2019re asked to voluntarily waive their right to a hearing and automatically accept the punishment. On first offense, that\u2019s generally a one-year SNAP ban. They\u2019re also required to repay the full amount the state says they misused.",
      "Often, these cases involve a relatively small amount of money. Records show that more than 900 people have been kicked off for \u201ctrafficking\u201d or misuse for less than $1,000 since 2022. The lowest amount alleged was 14 cents.",
      "The state has leaned heavily on administrative hearing waivers since 2015, and by 2023, almost a quarter of all disqualifications were via waiver. Some lawsuits allege individuals did not fully understand the consequences of the waivers and were encouraged to sign by officials.",
      "Kentucky Public Radio reviewed more than two dozen cases since 2020 in which the cabinet accused an individual of trafficking using only spending patterns, despite the participants\u2019 denial or lack of response \u2014 and with no other evidence or interviews presented, according to administrative hearing decisions.",
      "Kendra Steele, a spokesperson for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, declined to schedule an interview with cabinet officials after multiple requests. Steele said in an email that \u201cwe have never\u201d brought trafficking cases based solely on transactional data and acknowledged it would not be sufficient to prove intent.",
      "In response to a different question, Steele wrote the investigation into fraud allegations consists of looking into income, living situations \u201cand patterns of spending that are indicative of trafficking.\u201d She did not indicate how any of those factors could be used to prove intentional misuse or selling of SNAP benefits, or how it differs from relying on transactional data \u2014 which is inherently a pattern of spending. Steele said in another email that they also interview vendors and SNAP recipients.",
      "Roughly 4 in 25 Kentuckians suffer from food insecurity, similar to the national rate of about 14%, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The USDA will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d The decision comes in the wake of federal funding cuts for food and nutrition safety net programs nationwide.",
      "In the last fiscal year, 1 in 8 Kentuckians benefitted from SNAP, formerly called food stamps. Food insecurity in Kentucky\u2019s rural areas is even more stark, and legal representation harder to come by.",
      "\u201cThe people who benefit from these programs are some of the folks that we need to be helping the most in this country,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cIt\u2019s our fellow Kentuckians who are going hungry as a result of baseless allegations of waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d",

But administrative hearing decisions reviewed by KPR from 2020 through 2023 included evidence the cabinet relied on; hearing officers would frequently say a person had trafficked their benefits based on shopping patterns the state deemed suspicious.",
      "National legal experts who specialize in SNAP access say an overreliance on transactional data isn\u2019t unique to Kentucky. Transactional data was initially meant as a tool to identify potential fraud cases \u2014 not as a means to prove it, Georgetown law professor David Super said.",
      "He\u2019s studied SNAP disqualifications for decades, and has seen many cases where he believes transactional data is misconstrued as direct evidence of wrongdoing, instead of requiring a state to build cases with witnesses, affidavits, video evidence and plea deals.",
      "In one redacted 2023 state administrative hearing decision, a hearing officer decided a woman in the eastern Kentucky city of McKee had trafficked her benefits because she had made eight back-to-back transactions in a year. The decision also said she\u2019d checked her balance several times, made a few insufficient fund attempts and had incorrectly entered her PIN number a few times.",
      "She lost her SNAP benefits for a year. In an appeal, the woman told the state she has two kids and had recently discovered she was pregnant.",
      "\u201cEveryone forgets to get something and has to go back in the store and get it,\u201d she wrote, defending her back-to-back purchases.",
      "She received another hearing, but the outcome didn\u2019t change.",
      "Cabinet officials acknowledged in cross examinations during a 2023 case that back-to-back transactions and whole-dollar purchases aren\u2019t forbidden under SNAP rules, nor are recipients told that the cabinet considers them suspicious.",
      "But all of these things are used as evidence \u2014 sometimes the sole evidence \u2014 that a person misused their benefits.",
      "Kristie Goff, an AppalRed legal aid lawyer in Prestonsburg in southeast Kentucky, used to see many of these cases, though they\u2019ve declined in the last year.",
      "\u201cThere have been very few instances in cases I have handled, where a client was not able to give me a perfectly reasonable explanation for those transactions, and none of it was trafficking,\u201d Goff said. \u201cThere are no receipts, there\u2019s no video footage to show that someone\u2019s doing anything wrong. It\u2019s just a number written on a paper.\u201d",
      "While saying purchasing history is insufficient to prove trafficking, Kentucky judges have stopped short of demanding that the state change how it trains employees or conducts its SNAP investigations.",
      "In response to an open records request, the cabinet provided KPR with documents used to train investigators on intentional program violations. They appear to almost exclusively discuss transactional data, including investigating back-to-back payments, large transactions and whole-dollar purchases.",
      "In 2020, Michigan appellate judges decided transactional data alone is never sufficient to prove that a business \u2014 or person \u2014 fraudulently used SNAP benefits.",
      "Dodds believes that should be the standard for all states, including Kentucky.",
      "He is in the early stages of systematically reviewing thousands of SNAP benefit trafficking hearing decisions between 2020 and 2023. Data from about 700 decisions in 2020 alone already shows that many Kentuckians have been denied benefits before the state presents what he considers real evidence of guilt.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a handful of cases that I would say there was real evidence that they had done something wrong,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cThere was one where a woman was on the phone with the hearing officer while she was actively trying to sell her benefits. ... But cases with non-transactional data are exceedingly rare.\"",

      "A Seattle-area nonprofit group called Community Loaves donates home-baked bread and cookies to food banks in four states",
      "On a recent Saturday near Seattle, Cheryl Ewaldsen pulled three golden loaves of wheat bread out of her kitchen oven.",
      "The fragrant, oat-topped bread was destined not for her table, but for a local food bank, to be distributed to families increasingly struggling with hunger and the high cost of groceries.",
      "\u201cI just get really excited about it knowing that it\u2019s going to someone and they\u2019re going to make, like, 10 sandwiches,\u201d said Ewaldsen, 75, a retired university human resources director.",
      "Ewaldsen is a volunteer with Community Loaves, a Seattle-area nonprofit that started pairing home bakers with food pantries during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and hasn\u2019t stopped.",
      "Since 2020, the organization headed by Katherine Kehrli, the former dean of a culinary school, has donated more than 200,000 loaves of fresh bread and some 220,000 energy cookies to food banks. They come from a network of nearly 900 bakers in four states \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California and Idaho \u2014 and represent one of the largest such efforts in the country.",
      "Now, amid rising grocery prices and federal cuts to food aid for low-income people, demand for the group's donations of nutritious baked goods is greater than ever, Kehrli said.",
      "\u201cMost of our food banks do not get any kind of whole-grain sandwich bread donation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we ask what we could do better, they just say, \u2018Bring us more.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ewaldsen\u2019s bread goes to the nearby Edmonds Food Bank, where the client list has swelled from 350 households to nearly 1,000 in the past three years, according to program manager Lester Almanza.",
      "Nationwide, more than 50 million people a year receive charitable food assistance, according to Feeding America, a hunger relief organization.",
      "Anti-hunger experts say they expect the need to rise as recent federal legislation sharply cutting food aid to poor people takes effect. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the tax and spending cuts bill Republicans muscled through Congress in July means 3 million people would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.",
      "Gauging the impact, however, could soon be more difficult after the U.S. Agriculture Department recently said it would halt an annual report on hunger in America, saying it was redundant, costly and politicized \u201csubjective liberal fodder.\u201d After 30 years, the 2024 report, to be released on Oct. 22, will be the last, the agency said.",
      "\u201cEnding data collection will not end hunger, it will only make it a hidden crisis that is easier to ignore and more difficult to address,\u201d Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said in a statement.",
      "Almanza said federal funding for his food bank has dropped at least 10% this year, meaning that every donation helps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that a lot of people rely on,\u201d he said.",
      "That includes people like Chris Redfearn, 42, and his wife, Melanie Rodriguez-Redfearn, 43, who turned to a food bank in Everett, Washington, last spring after moving to the area to find work. They had to stretch their savings until she began a new position this month teaching history at a local college. Chris Redfearn, who has worked for decades in business, is still looking.",
      "\u201cThe food pantry assists with anywhere from $40 to $80 worth of savings weekly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to keep ourselves afloat.\u201d",

      "\u201cI love to bake and just an idea sparked: Would it be possible for us to help from our home and get important valuable nutrition to our food banks?\u201d she recalled.",
      "Many food pantries don\u2019t accept or distribute donations of homemade baked goods. Feeding America warns individual bakers against the practice, saying \u201csince food banks can\u2019t confirm how your baked goods were made or their ingredients, they can\u2019t be donated.\"",
      "But health department rules vary by state, Kehrli learned. In Washington and the other three states where Community Loaves now operates, bread is one of the few foods allowed to be donated from a home kitchen through a program like theirs.",
      "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to donate custard pies. We wouldn\u2019t be able to donate lasagna,\u201d Kehrli said. \u201cBut bread is deemed safe. Anything that is fully baked and does not require refrigeration.\u201d",
      "Still, Community Loaves bakers must follow approved recipes for the bread and two types of energy cookies. They obtain flour from common sources, and bake and deliver on a shared schedule twice a month.",
      "The bakers buy their own supplies, donating the cost of the ingredients as well as their time. Most make a few loaves per baking session before delivering them to local \u201chubs,\u201d where other volunteers collect the bread and transport it to the food banks.",
      "Bakers range from former professionals to beginners. A robust website with recipes and how-to videos backstops every step, Kehrli said.",
      "Baking the bread is satisfying on several levels, said Ewaldsen, who has donated nearly 800 loaves in less than two years. Part of it is addressing the physical need for food, but part is also addressing the spiritual hunger for connection with neighbors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the opportunity for me to bake something and to share something with others in the community, where they don\u2019t necessarily need to know who I am, but they know that there\u2019s a community that loves and cares for them,\u201d she said.",
      "While such sentiments are sincere and admirable, anti-hunger experts stress that individual donations can't take the place of adequately funded government services for struggling Americans.",
      "\u201cIt's beautiful that our communities act this way,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino of the Food Research & Action Center. \u201cBut it is a loaf of bread. That is going to feed one person \u2014 and there are millions in line.\"",

      "As mental health chatbots driven by artificial intelligence proliferate, a small number of states are trying to regulate them",

      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.",
      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

      "Maine has one of New England\u2019s highest food insecurity rates",
      "WINTERPORT, Maine -- Phylis Allen spends her days looking for things. She searches for potatoes at Sam\u2019s Club, cheap beets and ginger at Walmart and a local grocery store. She studies the weekly inventory from Good Shepherd, Maine\u2019s only food bank, for good deals on butter and cheese.",
      "Every Monday morning, she shops at three different stores, keeping lists of prices in her head and remembering what particular clients want. On a recent trip to Sam\u2019s Club, she was searching for affordable eggs.",
      "The diminutive 78-year-old food pantry director found them in a huge cooler. Stretching, she pulled two huge boxes off the top shelf \u2014 seven dozen eggs each, $21 a box. \u201c$2.82 a dozen,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good price for eggs.\u201d",
      "The eggs were destined for Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard, the food pantry in Winterport, Maine, that Allen has helped run for the past 17 years. Every Wednesday, she and a tightknit group of volunteers provide 25 to 30 families with heaping bags of food.",
      "Maine has long been one of the most food insecure states in New England. Directors of food pantries say the task of making sure people are fed is getting harder because of diminishing food supplies, increasing demand and an overwhelming reliance on volunteers, many of whom are retirees with ages up into their 80s.",
      "About one in seven people in rural Waldo County, where Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard is, were food insecure in 2023, a rate that was similar to the state and national average, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying on Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration cut more than $1 billion from two U.S. Department of Agriculture programs \u2014 the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides free food to food banks nationwide, and the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which provides funds to state, territorial and tribal governments to purchase food from local farmers for distribution to hunger relief organizations.",
      "\u201cI can watch the availability of federal food going down every month,\u201d Allen said.",
      "Charitable food networks are also bracing for $186 billion in cuts for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the federal low-income nutrition program better known as food stamps. In turn, Feeding America predicts that food pantries will see more demand.",
      "Complicating matters is the infrastructure through which the U.S. distributes most food to those who need help. In Maine, the nearly 600 hunger relief agencies that get free and low-cost food from Good Shepherd Food Bank rely on volunteers. This includes 250 food pantries as well as soup kitchens, senior centers, shelters, schools and youth programs.",
      "More than 75% of these organizations rely completely on volunteers, with no paid staff, according to Good Shepherd.",
      "Anna Korsen, who co-chairs the Ending Hunger in Maine advisory committee, said food pantries alone aren\u2019t the answer to food insecurity.",
      "\u201cIf our goal is to end hunger in Maine, which is a lofty goal, then we\u2019re not going to do that through a charitable food network that\u2019s run by volunteers, right?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be for crisis situations \u2026 but what has happened is that it is just a part of the food system now. It shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d",
      "Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard hummed with activity on a recent Wednesday morning, cans stacked in piles six feet high and children\u2019s collages taped to a cooler.",
      "Keith Ritchie was greeting clients \u2014 and keeping a gentle eye out to make sure no one took more than their fair share of limited foods. At 89, he is the pantry\u2019s oldest worker, although Betty Williams, 88, teases him about who\u2019s older.",
      "In more than 17 years of service, Ritchie said, \u201cI\u2019ve only missed twice.\u201d He drives 20 miles (32 kilometers) each way to dole out groceries and fill bags with \u201csurprises\u201d \u2013 donated items like Girl Scout cookies.",
      "\u201cYou see a lot of people you know,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody\u2019s name, but I don\u2019t need a name. I just look at their faces.\u201d",
      "Younger volunteers can be harder to come by than affordable eggs. About 35% of Mainers volunteer \u2014 the third-highest rate in the nation, according to a 2024 report on the state of Maine\u2019s civic health. But just 20% of millennials volunteer in Maine, half the rate of Gen Xers and baby boomers, the same report said.",

      "PORTLAND, Maine -- Australian scientists tested the strength of bite-resistant wetsuits by allowing sharks to chomp the materials at sea and found that the suits can help keep swimmers safe.",
      "Fatal shark bites are vanishingly rare, with less than 50 unprovoked shark bites on humans worldwide in 2024, according to the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History. But increased sightings of large sharks in some parts of the world have swimmers, surfers and divers looking for new ways to stay safe.",
      "Scientists with Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia, tested four bite-resistant materials and found they all reduced the amount of damage from shark bites. They performed the work by dragging samples of the materials behind boats and allowing white and tiger sharks to bite the samples.",
      "The bites from such large sharks can still cause internal and crushing injuries, but the materials showed effectiveness beyond a standard neoprene wetsuit, the scientists said. The research found that the bite-resistant materials \u201ccan reduce injuries sustained from shark encounters,\u201d said Flinders professor Charlie Huveneers, a member of the Southern Shark Ecology Group at Flinders and a study co-author.",
      "\"Bite-resistant material do not prevent shark bites, but can reduce injuries from shark bites and can be worn by surfers and divers,\" Huveneers said.",
      "There were small differences between the four tested materials, but they all \"reduced the amount of substantial and critical damage, which would typically be associated with severe hemorrhaging and tissue or limb loss,\u201d said Tom Clarke, a researcher with the science and engineering college at Flinders and a study co-author.",
      "Chainmail suits to resist shark bites have existed for decades, but lack in flexibility for aquatic activities like surfing and diving, the scientists said in research published in the journal Wildlife Research on Thursday. Newer wetsuits can be designed to provide flexibility as well as protection.",

That includes surfers and spearfishers, he said.",

In the extremely rare event that you get bitten by a shark, this material will hopefully make you bleed less than you would if you were not wearing this.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump's administration has extended Georgia's Pathways to Coverage program for 15 months",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's program that provides health insurance to some low-income adults that document work or other activities has been extended for 15 months by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp announced Thursday that the federal government approved that the Pathways to Coverage program will continue as part of the state-federal Medicaid program through December 2026. The five-year pilot program had been scheduled to expire next week, but Kemp argued Georgia should get more time because the program only started after a court battle with President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, which tried to shut it down.",
      "Georgia's program has been closely watched because Republicans mandated similar work requirements throughout the country as part of the tax and budget overhaul signed into law by Trump. Starting in 2027, some adults who seek Medicaid coverage must first show they are working, taking classes or performing community service for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "The Georgia program, which has similar work or activity requirements, has enrolled far fewer people than originally projected, covering 9,175 people as of August. It has spent twice as much on administrative costs than on providing actual health care. The Kemp administration had projected it would cover 25,000 people in its first year and up to 100,000 eventually.",
      "Critics warn the Georgia experience shows that millions will lose coverage under the Trump law because the administrative process will make it too difficult for them to document their work. Republicans have defended the low enrollment, saying Medicaid should be temporary for people who can get insurance through an employer.",
      "Pathways is Kemp's answer to pressure to expand Medicaid to cover all adults who earn less than 138% of federal poverty line wages, as originally envisioned under President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul. Georgia is one of 10 Republican-led states that refused to expand coverage. Instead, Kemp launched Pathways, offering coverage to people who earn up to the poverty line \u2014 $15,650 a year. Georgia\u2019s traditional Medicaid program still covers poorer children, disabled adults, poor people in nursing homes and a few other very poor adults.",
      "Under the extension, Georgia will offer health coverage to parents and guardians of children younger than six without any additional work requirement. The state will also let beneficiaries report qualifying work or activity hours only once a yearly, instead of monthly. Some beneficiaries had said the monthly reporting process was glitchy and hard to use. Insurance will also start on the first day of the month that an application is received, meaning hospitals and doctors will have an incentive to help uninsured patients apply in hopes of getting paid for care already delivered. Right now, coverage doesn't start until after someone is approved.",

In a Thursday statement, Warnock said that \u201cthe only thing Pathways is incredibly effective at is barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer.\"",

      "IFRC\u2019s Nzisa Mbalu said it is still early to fully assess the level of donor support for the Ebola response, adding that the organization has so far allocated 1.75 million swiss francs ($2.2 million) in emergency funds to respond to the outbreak.",

      "But the U.N. is big-tent politics at its biggest, so even as some components of the world body deal with drug enforcement, others emphasize public health programs \u2014 substance abuse treatment, overdose prevention and other services \u2014 over prohibition and punishments.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, has advocated for decriminalizing at least some drug use while clamping down on illegal markets. Given that policing hasn't reduced substance use or crime, \u201cthe so-called war on drugs has failed, completely and utterly,\u201d he said last year.",

      "At a gathering marking the report's release, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo deplored that \u201cthe global drug control regime has become a substantial part of the problem.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe question is: Do governments have the wisdom and courage to act?\u201d asked Zedillo, now a Yale professor and a commissioner of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, a Geneva-based anti-drug-war advocacy group.",
      "The other question is whether they could ever agree on what action to take.",
      "Even if countries agree \u2014 or say they do \u2014 with ending the drug trade and resulting ills, \u201cthe objectives might be different, and certain means, tools, resources they're willing to devote to them, are different,\u201d Felbab-Brown said.",
      "Nations' own drug laws vary widely. Some impose the death penalty for certain drug crimes. Others have legalized or decriminalized marijuana. At least one \u2014 Thailand \u2014 legalized it only to have second thoughts and tighten the rules. Countries' openness to needle exchange programs, safe injection sites and other \u201charm reduction\u201d strategies is similarly all over the map.",

It also says the military will no longer be paying for reservists or National Guard members to get the vaccine on their own time.",
      "News of the policy change, which has not been publicly announced by the Pentagon, comes as the Trump administration and its advisers have suggested changes to other vaccination guidance.

      "While the memo was quietly sent months ago, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth drew attention to it Wednesday when he reposted a comment from an anonymous account that claimed they \u201cwon\u2019t be forced to get a flu shot this fall for the privilege of serving my state and country in the National Guard.\u201d",

      "The criticism targets a plan from the Ministry of Energy and Mines in August to auction the rights for 49 oil and gas projects worth more than $47 billion.",
      "Officials say the \u201chydrocarbon roadmap\u201d is a strategy to modernize Ecuador\u2019s oil industry, attract foreign capital and boost production. Their plan includes contract renegotiations and new licensing rounds that the government says comply with existing legal frameworks.",
      "Indigenous groups say 18 of the proposed oil blocks overlap their territories \u2014 an area roughly the size of Belgium.",
      "Leaders from the Andwa, Shuar, Achuar, Kichwa, Sapara, Shiwiar and Waorani peoples say their communities were not consulted and accuse the government of ignoring court rulings that struck down earlier consultations as unconstitutional.",

      "Several recent moves by President Daniel Noboa have alarmed environmentalists and Indigenous leaders who say the country\u2019s green reputation is unraveling.",
      "Noboa's administration has moved to scrap Ecuador's independent Environment Ministry. He also supported a law passed by the National Assembly that lets private and foreign entities co-manage conservation zones that critics say weakens protections and threatens Indigenous land rights.",
      "\u201cThere have been protests, lawsuits and companies forced to withdraw in the past, but now they are once again offering up Amazon oil fields,\" Guiquita said. \"We are resisting, and we call on the international community to oppose this expansion and help protect the Amazon and our rights.\u201d",

      "Arnold Schwarzenegger is throwing his weight behind the Vatican\u2019s environmental initiative",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Arnold Schwarzenegger downplayed the Trump administration\u2019s climate skepticism Tuesday and threw his weight behind the Vatican\u2019s environmental initiative, saying individual choice, local regulations and the Catholic Church's moral leadership were far more important to \u201cterminate\u201d global warming.",
      "Schwarzenegger was at the Vatican to headline a three-day climate conference marking the 10th anniversary of Pope Francis\u2019 landmark 2015 environmental encyclical, Laudato Si (Praised Be). The document, one of Francis' main legacies, cast saving God\u2019s creation as an urgent moral imperative and launched a broad, grassroots movement that Pope Leo XIV has fully embraced and made his own.",
      "Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor of California, has devoted time to environmental causes since leaving political office in 2011. His Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative is one of the backers of the Vatican conference, which is being held at the Holy See\u2019s newly inaugurated environmental educational center in Castel Gandolfo south of Rome.",
      "At a news conference, Schwarzenegger was asked about President Donald Trump\u2019s recent comments to the U.N. General Assembly, where he falsely said that climate change was a \u201ccon job.\u201d Trump has long been a critic of climate science and policies aimed at helping the world transition to green energies like wind and solar. His administration has rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an \u201cAmerican energy dominance\u201d agenda.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t use the federal government as an excuse,\u201d Schwarzenegger told the Vatican briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy way out.\u201d",

      "KATHMANDU, Nepal -- A two-year-old girl chosen as Nepal\u2019s new living goddess was carried by family members from their home in an alley in Kathmandu to a temple palace Tuesday during the country's longest and most significant Hindu festival.",
      "Aryatara Shakya, at 2 years and 8 months, was chosen as the new Kumari or \u201cvirgin goddess,\u201d replacing the incumbent who is considered by tradition to become a mere mortal upon reaching puberty.",
      "Living goddesses are worshipped by both Hindus and Buddhists. The girls are selected between the ages of 2 and 4 and are required to have unblemished skin, hair, eyes and teeth. They should not be afraid of the dark.",
      "During religious festivals the living goddess is wheeled around on a chariot pulled by devotees. They always wear red, pin up their hair in topknots and a \u201cthird eye\u201d is painted on their forehead.",
      "Family, friends and devotees paraded Shakya through the streets of Kathmandu on Tuesday, before entering the temple palace which will be her home for several years.",
      "Devotees lined up to touch the girls\u2019 feet with their foreheads, the highest sign of respect among Hindus in the Himalayan nation, and offered her flowers and money. The new Kumari will bless devotees including the president on Thursday.",

      "Over the past few years, there have been many changes in tradition and the Kumari is now allowed to receive an education from private tutors inside the temple palace and even have a television set. The government also now offers retired Kumaris a small monthly pension.",

      "On a visit to New Zealand, FBI Director Kash Patel gave the country\u2019s police and spy bosses gifts of inoperable pistols that were illegal to possess under local gun laws and had to be destroyed",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- On a visit to New Zealand, FBI Director Kash Patel gave the country\u2019s police and spy bosses gifts of inoperable pistols that were illegal to possess under local gun laws and had to be destroyed, New Zealand law enforcement agencies told The Associated Press.",
      "The plastic 3D-printed replica pistols formed part of display stands Patel presented to at least three senior New Zealand security officials in July. Patel, the most senior Trump administration official to visit the country so far, was in Wellington to open the FBI\u2019s first standalone office in New Zealand.",
      "Pistols are tightly restricted weapons under New Zealand law and possessing one requires an additional permit beyond a regular gun license. Law enforcement agencies didn\u2019t specify whether the officials who met with Patel held such permits, but they couldn\u2019t have legally kept the gifts if they didn\u2019t.",
      "It wasn't clear what permissions Patel had sought to bring the weapons into the country. A spokesperson for Patel told the AP Tuesday that the FBI would not comment.",
      "Inoperable weapons are treated as though they\u2019re operable in New Zealand if modifications could make them workable again. The pistols were judged by gun regulators to be potentially operable and were destroyed, New Zealand\u2019s Police Commissioner Richard Chambers told AP in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Chambers didn\u2019t specify how the weapons had been rendered inoperable before Patel gifted them. Usually this means the temporary disabling of the gun\u2019s firing mechanism.",
      "Three of New Zealand\u2019s most powerful law enforcement figures said they received the gifts at meetings July 31. Chambers was one recipient, and the other two were Andrew Hampton, Director-General of the country\u2019s human intelligence agency NZSIS, and Andrew Clark, Director-General of the technical intelligence agency GCSB, according to a joint statement from their departments.",
      "A spokesperson for the spy agencies described the gift as \u201ca challenge coin display stand\u201d that included the 3D-printed inoperable weapon \u201cas part of the design.\u201d The officials sought advice on the gifts the next day from the regulator that enforces New Zealand\u2019s gun laws, Chambers said.",
      "When the weapons were examined, it was discovered they were potentially operable.",
      "\u201cTo ensure compliance with firearms laws, I instructed Police to retain and destroy them,\u201d Chambers said.",
      "James Davidson, a former FBI agent who is now president of the FBI Integrity Project, a nonprofit that seeks to safeguard the bureau from undue partisan influence, has criticized Patel's appointment.",
      "But Davidson said the gift of the replica pistols appeared \u201ca genuine gesture\u201d from Patel and their destruction was \u201cquite frankly, an overreaction by the NZSIS, which could have simply rendered the replica inoperable,\u201d he said.",

      "The guns Patel gifted to the law enforcement chiefs were not semiautomatic models now prohibited after the Christchurch massacre. But there are a suite of other reasons New Zealanders might not legally be able to possess certain weapons, including the specific permits required for pistols.",
      "New Zealand doesn\u2019t have a passionate culture of gun ownership and the weapons have been viewed more dimly since the mass shooting. Gun ownership is enshrined in New Zealand law as a privilege, not a right.",

      "News of Patel\u2019s visit caused ripples in New Zealand at the time because the opening of the new FBI field office in Wellington wasn\u2019t divulged to news outlets or the public until it had already happened. An FBI statement in July said the move aligned New Zealand with FBI missions in other Five Eyes intelligence-sharing nations, which also include the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.",

It wasn\u2019t immediately clear Tuesday how many officials received the pistols as gifts.",
      "Patel had already provoked mild diplomatic discomfort in Wellington by suggesting in remarks supplied to reporters that the new FBI office aimed to counter China\u2019s influence in the South Pacific Ocean, where New Zealand is located. The comments prompted polite dismissal from officials in Wellington, who said the bolstered FBI presence was primarily to collaborate on child exploitation and drug smuggling crimes. Beijing decried Patel\u2019s remarks.",

If she had been denied bail, she would have been immediately removed from her position as an elected Member of Parliament.",
      "The court\u2019s action, though expected, underlines that Thailand's machinery of state remains deeply conservative, despite a recent change of government and the opposition People\u2019s Party\u2019s standing as the biggest party in Parliament. Thailand\u2019s political establishment is sensitive about any perceived threats to the status of the country\u2019s monarchy.",
      "Other recent appeals involving political activists have seen rulings that reversed the acquittal of lower courts or handed down longer prison sentences.",
      "Chonthicha\u2019s case is related to a speech she gave during a 2021 political rally in which she demanded the release of all political prisoners. She was found guilty for parts of the speech alleging that the then-government, led by Prayuth Chan-ocha, changed a law to give more power to King Maha Vajiralongkorn.",

Inflation remains stubbornly high and the economic outlook subdued, frustrating efforts to repair tattered public services and ease the cost of living.",
      "Treasury chief Rachel Reeves said Monday that wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have caused \u201charsh global headwinds,\u201d and hard economic choices loom when she sets out her budget in November.",

Farage\u2019s party has topped opinion polls for months, ahead of both Labour and the main opposition Conservatives, despite holding just five of the 650 seats in the House of Commons.",
      "Farage\u2019s anti-establishment, anti-immigration message, with its echoes of Trump\u2019s MAGA movement, has homed in on the issue of thousands of migrants in small boats arriving in Britain across the English Channel. More than 30,000 people have made the dangerous crossing from France so far this year despite efforts by authorities in Britain, France and other countries to crack down on people-smuggling gangs.",
      "Farage has vowed to deport everyone arriving by small boat and go even farther, stripping the right to remain in the U.K. from many legal residents.",
      "Starmer said on the weekend that such a policy would be \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cimmoral,\u201d and he has accused Farage of nurturing a \u201cpolitics of grievance\u201d that turns people against one another. He has expressed alarm that a march organized by anti-immigration campaigner and convicted fraudster Tommy Robinson attracted more than 100,000 people in London this month.",
      "Starmer will warn in his speech that the path to renewal is \u201clong, it\u2019s difficult, it requires decisions that are not cost-free or easy.",
      "\u201cIt is a test,\u201d he plans to say. \u201cA fight for the soul of our country, every bit as big as rebuilding Britain after the war, and we must all rise to this challenge.\u201d",

The couple never imagined that they, their daughter and P\u00e9rez\u2019s parents would live there for three months, sleeping on pullout couches and relying on a gas generator.",
      "The Category 4 hurricane flooded P\u00e9rez and Andino\u2019s house with 4 feet of water. Unable to return home, the founders and directors of Mauro Ballet decided to open their doors to the community, teaching a free dance class each afternoon.",
      "\u201cIt became an oasis for dancers in Puerto Rico,\u201d said Andino. But Mauro Ballet still struggled \u2014 the dance company didn\u2019t make money for 18 months.",
      "It survived in part thanks to support from the Flamboyan Arts Fund, a $22 million initiative propelled by Lin-Manuel Miranda and his family, and funded mainly by money raised during a 2019 run of Miranda\u2019s acclaimed Broadway musical \u201cHamilton\u201d in San Juan.",
      "\u201cArtists always get left out of the conversation,\u201d Miranda, an award-winning writer and performer whose parents were raised in Puerto Rico, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe wanted to make sure they were not forgotten in relief efforts.\u201d",
      "Instead of being forgotten, artists assumed essential roles, helping the archipelago grieve from Maria\u2019s devastation and articulating the challenges Puerto Ricans faced.",
      "\u201cYou can use the arts in so many ways to express your feelings, and to heal,\u201d said P\u00e9rez.",
      "The Flamboyan Arts Fund has supported 110 Puerto Rican arts organizations and 900 artists. Now the Miranda family and the D.C.-based Flamboyan Foundation are committing an additional $10 million to Puerto Rican arts and culture.",
      "Despite federal funding cuts to arts and humanities, the new phase of giving is meant to go beyond emergency relief \u2014 helping arts and culture thrive and even become an economic driver for the archipelago.",
      "\u201cIt just gives us too much back,\u201d said Miranda, 45. \u201cIf you have ever enjoyed the work that comes from this island and its descendants, to invest in that future is important.\u201d",
      "Hurricane Maria led to an estimated nearly 3,000 deaths, most of them related to the lack of power, clean water, and other services. Damages surpassed $115 billion, and power outages lasted 11 months in some places.",
      "The destruction was so vast that Marianne Ram\u00edrez Aponte, executive director and chief curator of the Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo in San Juan, worried the cultural sector could not overcome it.",
      "What happened instead was \u201cquite the opposite,\u201d she said.",
      "Arts groups opened their spaces as relief hubs and activated mutual aid networks. \u201cCultural brigades\u201d deployed their talents to comfort and entertain.",
      "\u201cIt was a horrible situation, but we were able to prove the importance of art in the social process,\u201d said Yari Helfeld, executive director of the community theater company Y No Hab\u00eda Luz.",
      "Helfeld got requests to perform from isolated communities in Puerto Rico\u2019s central mountains just weeks after the storm. She was surprised to be asked for theater when people still struggled to access food and water.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019re helping heal the spirit,\u2019\u201d said Helfeld.",
      "Artists could also channel and contextualize the public frustration over the U.S. territory\u2019s slow recovery. Maria exposed the consequences of what many Puerto Ricans still consider a colonial relationship with the U.S.",

      "\u2014 The Education Department will furlough about 1,500 of 1,700 employees, excluding federal student aid workers. The department will continue to disburse student aid such as Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student Loans. Student loan borrowers will still be required to make payments on their outstanding debt.",
      "\u2014 National Park Service: As a general rule if a facility or area is inaccessible during nonbusiness hours, it'll be locked for the duration of the lapse in funding, said a March 2024 plan. At parks where it's impractical or impossible to restrict public access, staffing will vary by park: \u201cGenerally, where parks have accessible park areas, including park roads, lookouts, trails, campgrounds, and open-air memorials, these areas will remain physically accessible to the public.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Transportation Department: Air traffic controller hiring and field training would cease, as would routine personnel security background checks and air traffic performance analysis, a March 2025 update says.",

      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., ruled that the U.S. Agency for Global Media cannot implement a reduction in force eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees on Tuesday. Those employees represent the vast majority of its remaining staff.",
      "Kari Lake, the agency\u2019s acting CEO, announced in late August that the job cuts would take effect Tuesday. But the judge's ruling preserves the status quo at the agency until he rules on a plaintiffs' underlying motion to block the reduction in force.",
      "Lamberth previously ruled that President Donald Trump\u2019s Republican administration must restore VOA programming to levels commensurate with its statutory mandate to \u201cserve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news.\u201d He also blocked Lake from removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA\u2019s director.",
      "Lamberth accused the administration of showing \u201cconcerning disrespect\u201d toward the court in response to his earlier orders to produce information about its plans for Voice of America. He noted that the agency initiated the job cuts only hours after a hearing last month in which government lawyers said a reduction in force, or RIF, was merely a possibility.",
      "\u201cThe defendants\u2019 obfuscation of this Court\u2019s request for information regarding whether their RIF plans comported with the preliminary injunction has wasted precious judicial time and resources and readily support contempt proceedings,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "But he said he wouldn\u2019t initiate contempt proceedings on his own because the plaintiffs haven\u2019t sought it yet.",
      "\u201cHowever, (the court\u2019s) deference to the plaintiffs with respect to further proceedings should not be mistaken for lenience toward the defendants\u2019 egregious erstwhile conduct,\u201d he added.",
      "Employees who sued to block the dismantling of Voice of America claimed the planned cuts would hamper the judge\u2019s ability to enforce the injunction he issued in April. \u201cThis Court should therefore preserve the status quo while the parties litigate compliance,\u201d their attorneys wrote.",
      "Government lawyers accused the plaintiffs of impermissibly trying to micromanage the agency\u2019s operations. \u201cEnjoining the reductions in force would be a wholly overbroad and improper remedy,\u201d they wrote.",

      "New rules that limit the access of journalists in the Pentagon and appear to condition entry into the building on agreement to restrictions have led to a standoff between the press and the Trump administration's defense department",
      "Journalists who cover the Pentagon and the Trump admnistration are in a standoff about new rules that limit the access of the media to most areas within the Pentagon and appear to condition overall entry to the building on an agreement to restrictions in reporting.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's team characterizes the changes as an effort to protect national security and the safety of those who work at the Pentagon, while many in the press see it as an effort to exert control and avoid embarrassing stories.",
      "Journalists who want to hold on to badges that permit access to the Pentagon were told on Sept. 19 they must sign a letter acknowledging the new rules by this Tuesday or the badge \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d The new policy says that Defense Department information \u201cmust be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if unclassified.\u201d Classified material faces even tighter restrictions.",
      "That level of control immediately alarmed journalists and their advocates.",
      "\u201cAsking independent journalists to submit to these kinds of restrictions is at stark odds with the constitutional protections of a free press in a democracy, and a continued attempt to throttle the public's right to understand what their government is doing,\u201d said Charles Stadtlander, spokesman for The New York Times.",
      "In a subsequent letter to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Hegseth aide Sean Parnell suggested that journalists misunderstood some of the new rules. He said, for example, that the restriction against releasing unclassified information is the policy that Pentagon officials must follow \u2014 not something the journalists must abide by.",
      "\u201cIt should come as no surprise that the mainstream media is once again misrepresenting the Pentagon's press procedures,\u201d Parnell said in a post on X. \u201cLet's be absolutely clear: Journalists are not required to clear their stories with us. That claim is a lie.\u201d",
      "However, the new policy says that journalists who encourage Pentagon officials to break the rules \u2014 in other words, ask sources for information \u2014 could be subject to losing their building access.",
      "While it appeared that Parnell sought to soften some of the hard edges of his policy in response to questions raised by the reporters' committee, there's still enough confusion to merit a meeting to clear things up, said Grayson Clary, a lawyer for RCFP. There's some wariness among news organizations about what they would be agreeing to if they sign the letter, and it's not clear how many people \u2014 if any \u2014 have done so.",
      "The new rules continue a tense relationship between the press and the Hegseth team, which had already evicted some news outlets from their regular workspaces in favor of friendlier outlets and limited the ability of reporters to roam around the Pentagon. Hegseth and Parnell seldom hold press briefings.",
      "Parnell did not respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt's control, just 100% control,\u201d said Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine. Goldberg, who is not stationed at the Pentagon, wrote the most embarrassing story of Hegseth's tenure so far when he was inadvertently included in a Signal group chat where Hegseth and other national officials discussed an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen. The brouhaha became widely known as \u201cSignalgate.\u201d",
      "Pentagon leadership was also reportedly unhappy over a story that said Elon Musk was to get a briefing on military strategy for China, leading President Donald Trump to stop it, and other stories about initial assessments of damage in the military strike against Iran.",
      "No American reporter accredited to the Pentagon that he knows is interested in subverting national security or putting anyone in the military in harm's way, Goldberg said.",
      "In his own case, Goldberg did not report on what he learned until after the attack was over. He said he contacted officials in the group chat to ask if there was anything he learned that was harmful to the country in any way. He did not include in his story the name of a CIA official mentioned in the messages who was technically still undercover, he said.",
      "\u201cThe only people in Signalgate who were putting American troops in harm's way were the national leadership of the United States by discussing on a commercial messaging app the launch times of strikes on a hostile country,\u201d he said.",

      "CSX railroad replaced its CEO less than two months after an investment fund urged it to either find another railroad to merge with to better compete with the proposed transcontinental Union Pacific railroad or fire outgoing CEO Joe Hinrichs",
      "CSX railroad announced Monday that it had replaced its CEO less than two months after an investment fund urged it to either find another railroad to merge with to better compete with the proposed transcontinental Union Pacific railroad or fire outgoing CEO Joe Hinrichs.",
      "The outgoing CEO, who came to the railroad in 2022 after a long career with Ford, focused on repairing CSX's relationship with its workers and labor unions and unifying the team after a bitter contract fight. But Ancora Holdings, which helped spur major changes at Norfolk Southern, said CSX's operating performance deteriorated significantly under Hinrichs' leadership. Hinrichs resigned to clear the way for Steve Angel to become CEO effective Sunday.",
      "Angel, 70, also comes from outside the rail industry although earlier in his career he oversaw GE's locomotive building unit, so he does have that experience. CSX said he has 45 years experience leading large public companies, including most recently as CEO of Linde and Praxair that provide industrial gasses to other companies.",
      "\u201cWe are excited to welcome Steve as our new CEO. He is a visionary in creating long-term value and an expert in guiding companies through significant transformation,\" the railroad's board Chairman John Zillmer said.",
      "CSX has been under pressure from Ancora and other investors since Union Pacific announced its $85 billion deal to acquire Norfolk Southern, which is CSX's rival in the eastern United States. But both BNSF and CPKC railroads said they aren't interested in a merger right now.",
      "Ancora said CSX has delivered disappointing shareholder returns and poor financial performance during Hinrichs' tenure. But over the past year, CSX was working on two major construction projects \u2014 repairs from Hurricane Helene and a major tunnel renovation in Baltimore \u2014 that disrupted the railroad. Both those projects were just completed this month, so CSX's performance was expected to improve in the fourth quarter.",
      "Even though he's not a railroader, Ancora praised Angel's hiring because of his experience with mergers and acquisitions. The top executives at Ancora, Frederick D. DiSanto and James Chadwick, said in their statement that they believe Hinrichs \u201cbotched the opportunity\u201d to merge with another railroad and may have even fought the idea. They said Angel is expected to be more aggressive at pursuing a deal and that he will re-evaluate the railroad's leadership team.",
      "\u201cWith President Donald Trump and other policymakers recently expressing enthusiasm for the benefits of a transcontinental railroad, CSX and other Class I railroads have no choice but to embrace the industry\u2019s new realities,\u201d the Ancora executives said. \u201cAlthough Steve Angel is not a railroader by trade, his M&A pedigree and value creation record indicate his appointment is an initial step in the right direction for CSX.\u201d",
      "Angel promised to make improvements at the Jacksonville, Florida-based company, which is one of the six largest railroads in North America.",

      "Angel will earn a $1.5 million salary, but he will also be eligible for a performance stock grant targeted at $13.5 million next year if CSX hits certain performance goals. He will also receive a separate $10 million stock grant that will vest after three years based on performance. Angel will also be eligible to collect retirement from the railroad after three years. CSX also outlined a separate agreement that would pay Angel triple his salary and target bonus in the event of another railroad taking control of CSX.",
      "Ancora said it continues to buy more CSX shares and hopes to develop a better relationship with the railroad. Ancora holds three seats on Norfolk Southern's board after running a proxy campaign there to oust the previous CEO at that railroad, so the investment fund had input on the Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern merger.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Emily Nasseff Mitsch said Angel\u2019s experience overseeing the complex merger of Linde and Praxair should give CSX a strategic edge in any potential rail consolidation.",
      "Most observers believe CSX and BNSF will be at a disadvantage if the Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern merger gets approved. That transcontinental railroad will be able to shave more than a day off delivery times because it won\u2019t have to hand off shipments between railroads in the middle of the country. So far, those railroads have said they believe they could achieve most of the benefits of a merger through cooperative agreements.",
      "\u201cAngel brings exceptional credentials from 22 years at GE\u2019s locomotive operations and demonstrated value creation, generating over 200% returns at Linde and Praxair while executing major industrial mergers. We believe this positions CSX for its next growth phase,\u201d Mitsch said.",

      "Unlike that drug, known as Epidiolex, the new cannabis formula from drugmaker Vertanical contains THC, the active ingredient in marijuana that gets users high. But levels of the chemical are very low, essentially a microdose compared to what\u2019s available in gummies, chocolate bars and other products sold at marijuana dispensaries in the U.S. The company said patients in the trial didn\u2019t show any signs of drug abuse, dependence or withdrawal.",
      "Driving is not recommended during the first few weeks of taking the drug, although the company said the decision of whether to drive was ultimately left to patients.",
      "Vertanical is seeking approval for a large group of patients: those suffering from lower-back pain, a chronic condition that affects millions and has few proven treatments.",
      "Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can\u2019t be used for long-term pain because of their side effects, which include stomach ulcers and indigestion. Opioids are no longer recommended, after the overprescribing of painkillers such as OxyContin in the 1990s and 2000s led to the ongoing epidemic of addiction to that class of drug.",
      "Chronic pain is one of the most frequently cited conditions of people enrolled in state-run medical marijuana programs. But there's been little rigorous research on the drug's use in that group.",
      "Lead study author Dr. Matthias Karst said in an email that the new findings show cannabis \"can significantly reduce pain and improve physical function in patients with chronic low-back pain, without the safety concerns commonly associated with opioids.\u201d Karst is a pain specialist at Hannover Medical School and a consultant for Vertanical.",

      "So you're booking your flight, and just when you're about to check out, the airline asks if you'd like to pay a little something to offset your share of the flight's pollution. Or, maybe you're an environmentally minded person, and you've heard you can buy these things called carbon offsets.",
      "Are they worth it? Let's explore.",
      "A roundtrip flight from New York to Los Angeles emits more than 1,300 pounds (about 614 kilograms) of planet-warming carbon dioxide per passenger, according to an emissions calculator from the International Civil Aviation Organization. That's about the amount of pollution you'd save if you swore off meat for 17 months.",
      "Jet engines burn fossil fuels, releasing planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. They also release water vapor, which turns into long, thin clouds called contrails that trap heat instead of letting it escape to space \u2014 additional warming that isn't typically included in a flight's emissions, said Diane Vitry, aviation director at a clean energy advocacy organization called the European Federation for Transport and Environment.",
      "Reducing emissions from air travel is difficult. Batteries weigh too much and provide too little power for long flights. Sustainable aviation fuel \u2014 biofuels made from things like corn, oil seeds and algae that can be mixed with jet fuel \u2014 is currently more expensive than traditional fuel and lacking sufficient supply to be in wide use.",
      "\u201cAviation is the problem child,\u201d Vitry said. \u201cAviation and shipping are not decarbonizing, and definitely not fast enough.\u201d",
      "That's where carbon offsets come in.",
      "A carbon offset is a certificate or a permit to emit planet-warming gases. It's connected to something that stores or reduces carbon emissions \u2014 for example, planting trees, or funding renewable energy.",
      "The idea is that the program or action offsets your pollutive action. You drive a car that pollutes a certain amount, you buy a carbon offset that leads to the planting of a tree that sequesters the same amount, and bam: the pollutive action (driving) is offset (tree planting).",
      "They've gotten popular enough that there's an entire marketplace that connects people and companies wanting to reduce their impacts with other companies that promise to do so.",

      "Sure, you can plant a tree, but Vitry said that doesn\u2019t stop your flight's emissions from entering the atmosphere. The tree may eventually absorb an equivalent amount of emissions. Or it may die. Or it may be sold as an offset multiple times by an unscrupulous company, meaning the tree can't possible absorb all the emissions it's supposed to.",

      "She said that\u2019s partly because the voluntary offset market is largely unregulated, and it\u2019s really difficult to measure offsets. The other problem is everyone involved benefits from over-exaggerating the benefits of offsets. \u201cThe buyer of the credit wants the cheap credits, the seller of the credits wants to get more credits for the same activity and the third party verifier is hired by the project developer, so has a conflict of interest to be lenient,\u201d Haya said.",
      "Jodi Manning, chief executive of the carbon offset nonprofit Cool Effect, said consumers should beware of offset programs that don't say clearly which project will benefit from your purchase or how much of your money is going to a project.

      "The Bengals (2-2) never crossed midfield after an opening-drive field goal for a 3-0 lead as Denver's defense limited Cincinnati to a mere 159 yards of offense \u2014 to the Broncos' 512 \u2014 and two third-down conversions all night.",
      "With 101 yards on 16 carries, J.K. Dobbins recorded Denver's first 100-yard rushing game since Latavius Murray did it against the Chargers in the 2022 season finale, a span of 38 games, including the playoffs.",

      "The Bengals (2-2) lost their second straight game behind backup quarterback Jake Browning, who is filling in with star Joe Burrow recovering from toe surgery. They were coming off their biggest blowout in their history, a 48-10 drubbing at Minnesota, and this one wasn\u2019t much better.",
      "\u201cThe last two weeks just feels like never really had momentum,\u201d Browning said, \"haven\u2019t really been explosive, have one or two good plays and then and then we\u2019ll get into the first-and-20. And then you\u2019re fighting a hard battle with one arm behind your back when you end up in longer situations, second-and-long, first-and-long, leading to third-and-long. Good offenses don\u2019t do that, so we need to clean it up.\u201d",
      "The Broncos (2-2) still haven't trailed in the fourth quarter and for the first time since the opener, the outcome wasn't decided on a walk-off field goal as time expired.",
      "Cincinnati went up 3-0 on Evan McPherson's short field goal, but then gained just two first downs the rest of the first half and committed eight penalties, the franchise's most before halftime in at least 15 years.",
      "The Bengals punted on all eight possessions after their opening field goal, save for a kneel-down at halftime when the Broncos led 21-3.",
      "Another flag negated the Bengals' biggest play when PJ Jules snatched the ball from punt returner Marvin Mims Jr. at the Denver 15-yard line after a bobble. But because Mims had waved for a fair catch, the call was interference and Denver maintained possession.",
      "After a three-and-out to start the game, during which Nix burned a timeout, the Broncos grabbed control with three touchdown drives. Nix ran it in from 6 yards out, Mims scored on a 16-yard end-around and Courtland Sutton hauled in a 20-yard scoring pass on the drive following Nix's end zone interception.",
      "\u201cIf you get into any trouble, just find me,\u201d said Sutton, whose TD came with 8 seconds left in the first half.",

      "\u201cFor him to be able to have that level of, I don't know, peace about it,\u201d tight end Darren Waller said. \u201cIn the NFL, there's so many things that can happen.

      "Democratic senators introduced a bill Monday that would rewrite a 1961 law prohibiting college sports conferences from banding together to sell their media rights. It's a move they say is designed to protect athletes, Olympics sports and smaller leagues that could be getting priced out of the increasingly expensive business of name, image and likeness deals.",
      "Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., joined with Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., in backing the Student Athlete Fairness and Enforcement (SAFE) Act, a bill that gives lawmakers an alternative to a bill on the House side that has yet to come up for a floor vote.",
      "\u201cWe take a broader approach of: How do we solve the fundamental problem of implementing NIL rights, but also keeping revenue for women's and Olympic sports and an environment where everyone feels like they can compete?\u201d Cantwell said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd we're maximizing for consumers and the public the amount of content available.\u201d",
      "Conferences currently sell their media rights separately, with the Big Ten, for instance, distributing around $958 million to its schools from the proceeds while the Big 12 number is at around $558 million \u2014 a 52.7% difference. All conferences are part of the $7.8 billion ESPN deal for the College Football Playoff, though the Big Ten and Southeastern Conference get more money from it.",
      "Cantwell has previously said she wants to prevent college sports from turning into a \u201cPower 2,\u201d featuring those leagues, with everyone else contending for scraps.",
      "Uunder terms of the landmark House antitrust settlement, schools as of July 1 are allowed to share up to 22% of their revenues \u2014 or around $20.5 million \u2014 from TV and other proceeds to pay players for their NIL during this school year.",
      "It has left some in the non-\u201cPower 2\u201d conferences wondering how they can draw top talent in football and basketball \u2014 the main revenue drivers \u2014 while maintaining smaller sports that form the pipeline for the teams America sends to the Olympics.",
      "The Democratic proposal, which would offer schools the same antitrust protection it does for the NFL and other pro leagues regarding their TV rights, is what billionaire Texas Tech regents chair Cody Campbell has proposed, going as far as running 30-second TV ads devoted to the topic on college football broadcasts.",
      "\u201cI think he thinks this is a way to even out the resources among all schools so that we can still have \u2018Any Given Saturday\u2019\u201d in college football, Cantwell said.",
      "Investors have floated ideas of super leagues, which would presumably involve pooling all the major-conference TV rights, estimating it could drive up to a $15 billion increase in revenue.",
      "Cantwell positions her bill as an alternative to the SCORE Act, which started with momentum but has recently stalled on the House side despite support from the NCAA.",

      "Cantwell's bill keeps the pre-emption idea but does not include the other two.",
      "\u201cThose closest to college sports ... have consistently called on Congress to take action to address the actual threats facing collegiate athletics,\" NCAA senior vice president Tim Buckley said. \u201cThis includes protecting student-athletes from being forced to become employees, and ensuring academic standards and other commonsense rules can be applied consistently.\u201d",
      "Cantwell's bill also offers strengthened protections for athletes from losing scholarships or health care. It would limit the number of times an athlete could transfer schools to two. It would give the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general authority to go after parties who violate rules written to oversee third-party collectives that now fund and oversee many of the NIL deals.",
      "The bill calls for football and basketball games to not be behind a paywall in local markets, a provision similar to how the NFL operates and that National Association of Broadcasters president Curtis LeGeyt said would strengthen \u201cthe unique connection between universities, their communities and the student-athletes who inspire them.\u201d",
      "The bill also calls on schools to use extra revenue generated from the new pooled media rights to maintain scholarships and roster spots for Olympic and women's sports at the same or greater levels than they were in 2023-24.",

      "President of Baseball Operations David Stearns immediately took the blame at a Citi Field news conference for a club he said \u201cunderachieved greatly,\u201d acknowledging New York's pitching and defense were especially problematic as the Mets went 38-55 over their last 93 games.",
      "The players acquired leading up to the July 31 trade deadline were mostly major flops in New York, namely Cedric Mullins, Ryan Helsley and Gregory Soto, and Stearns lamented \u201cwe didn\u2019t do a good enough job of fortifying our team when we had injuries midseason.\u201d",
      "\u201cTremendously disappointing season. Not nearly good enough. I think we all know that,\u201d he said at the outset of a question-and-answer session that lasted 31 minutes.",

      "The Minnesota Twins have fired manager Rocco Baldelli, ending his seven-year tenure that included three AL Central titles after a second straight disappointing season",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Twins fired manager Rocco Baldelli on Monday, ending his seven-year tenure that included three AL Central titles after a second straight disappointing season.",
      "Minnesota announced Baldelli's firing following a season marked by a major selloff leading up to the trade deadline after the team faltered in June and failed to mount any momentum in July. The Twins (70-92) went 19-35 after the deadline passed following the departure of 10 players off their major league roster, with only the Colorado Rockies faring worse over the final two months.",
      "The Twins finished with the fourth-worst record in the major leagues and their worst mark since 2016, when they went 59-103 after firing longtime general manager Terry Ryan at midseason. Current team president Derek Falvey was hired to replace Ryan after that.",
      "\"Over the past seven years Rocco has been much more than our manager. He has been a trusted partner and teammate to me in leading this organization,\u201d Falvey said in a statement. \u201cTogether we shared a deep care for the Twins, for our players and staff, and for doing everything in our power to put this club in the best position to succeed. Along the way we experienced some meaningful accomplishments, and I will always be proud of those, even as I wish we had ultimately achieved more.",
      "\u201cThis is a difficult day because of what Rocco represents to so many people here. He led with honesty, integrity, and an unwavering commitment to our players and staff. He gave himself fully to this role and I have tremendous respect and gratitude for the way he carried himself and the way he showed up every single day.\"",
      "For the second straight year, uncertainty around Baldelli\u2019s status hovered around the club. The Twins, who went 87-75 in 2023 to win their third AL Central title under Baldelli and their first series in the playoffs in 21 years, were in firm control of a wild-card spot down the stretch last season before tumbling out of contention with a 12-27 record over the last six weeks to land at 82-80.",
      "Factoring that finish into their extended funk this year, the Twins are 82-119 over their last 201 games for a .408 winning percentage. That includes a 13-game winning streak they produced earlier this season.",
      "Attendance has swooned at Target Field, with the Twins finishing with an 81-home game total of a little more than 1.7 million tickets sold, their lowest number in a non-pandemic season since 2000 when they played at the Metrodome and finished 69-93. Fans have mostly directed their disdain toward ownership, with deep frustration over cost-cutting that came after the 2023 breakthrough. The Pohlad family put the franchise up for sale last year, but decided last month to keep control and bring on two new investment groups for an infusion of cash to help pay down debt.",
      "The dizzying trade-deadline activity left Baldelli and his staff without much to work with down the stretch, though All-Star center fielder Byron Buxton was a bright spot in a breakthrough season for his health and rookie second baseman Luke Keaschall provided consistent production and a professional approach at the plate belying his inexperience.",

      "Baldelli was hired before the 2019 season to replace Hall of Famer Paul Molitor, with Falvey citing his adaptivity to the data-based direction of baseball strategy and his communication skill in distilling it to coaches and players and clearly setting expectations and preferences.",

I understand fully the position that I\u2019m in now. My job and the team\u2019s success is evaluated accordingly as well. You without a doubt hope that there can be consistency in these leadership positions. We\u2019ve got to get back to a place where we\u2019re getting in the playoffs, we\u2019re making runs in playoffs. That\u2019s what our fan base deserves, that\u2019s what the city deserves.\u201d",

      "Thomas Melchior shows up at soccer games wearing the jersey of the home team\u2019s fiercest rival \u2014 a move sure to rile the home fans \u2014 while holding a sign that says \u201clost a bet.\u201d",

      "\u201cYes, it\u2019s dangerous, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for anyone,\u201d Melchior told The Associated Press on Sunday, before he unveiled his hidden Hertha Berlin jersey at a home game of local rival Union Berlin.",
      "The sign says he lost a bet, but Melchior lost so much more. A former bank teller, he was sentenced to 5\u00bd years in prison in 2019 for fraud and theft offenses against strangers and people he knew after losing more than 800,000 euros ($937,000 today) on gambling.

That\u2019s when I felt I had survived gambling addiction,\u201d Melchior said. \u201cIn that moment, I decided I would try to repair all the damage. And I wanted to get out of prison with the best possible conditions so I could inform and warn people about gambling addiction. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here today.\u201d",
      "Melchior, who has quickly built up a large following on TikTok and Instagram, received a mostly positive response from fans on Sunday \u2014 his message had already reached many through social media and some fans stopped for selfies \u2014 but there were others who expressed surprise or amusement.",
      "\u201cPoor sod!\u201d some fans laughed as they kept walking. Others stopped to talk and to hear Melchior\u2019s story and his advice to \u201ckeep your finger away from sports betting.\u201d Some covered his Hertha shirt with Union stickers.",
      "Coincidentally, last week the German soccer players\u2019 union (VDV) called on the German soccer federation (DFB) to stop accepting sponsorship funds from sports betting providers and to do more to prevent gambling addiction.",

      "\u201cYou deserve it x1000,\u201d Mbappe graciously posted on social media.",
      "In second place was teenage sensation Lamine Yamal \u2014 a player of such prodigious talent that he is now the one predicted to dominate the Ballon d'Or. A new generation is threatening to usurp Mbappe before he's even established himself at the top.",

      "He said the emergence of the 18-year-old Yamal places doubts over whether Mbappe would become a multiple Ballon d'Or winner.",
      "\u201cNow it could be very complicated because of the fascination of this young player of 18 years that broke all the records for (someone his) age,\u201d said Caioli. \u201cAlso the age starts to be interesting for Mbappe. He's not 19 years old like when he won the World Cup. It\u2019s changed.\u201d",
      "Yamal, who has already led Spain to a European Championship and Barcelona to the Spanish title in his nascent career, won the Kopa trophy for the best under-21 player for the second year running. But there were claims he deserved the top prize, which would have made him the youngest ever recipient of the Ballon d'Or - overtaking Brazil striker Ronaldo, who won it aged 21.",
      "La Liga president Javier Tebas said the forward was only overlooked because of his age. Yamal\u2019s father said his son was the \u201cbest player in the world by far.\u201d",
      "There was no such outrage in response to Mbappe missing out. Not even from his club, Real Madrid, which last year boycotted the ceremony when Vinicius Junior was beaten to the prize by Manchester City midfielder Rodri.",
      "Frankly, Mbappe was barely part of the conversation this year despite winning the Golden Shoe as the top scorer in Europe.",
      "But at the age of 26, Mbappe's levels are not dropping. The Golden Shoe was the first of his career and last month he moved past Thierry Henry's total of 51 goals for France. He is now just six short of overtaking Olivier Giroud as his country's all-time leading scorer.",
      "He was the first teenager since Brazil great Pele to score in a World Cup final when France won in 2018. And he followed that four years later by becoming only the second player to score a hat trick in the final when France lost on penalties against Argentina.",
      "He left Paris Saint-Germain as the club's all-time top scorer.",
      "Yet despite the comments by Tebas and Yamal\u2019s father, few could say Dembele was not a deserved winner of the Ballon d'Or as the star player of a PSG team that won the Champions League and the French league and Cup, scoring 32 goals.",
      "While it was a year of personal redemption for Dembele, whose career had stalled after a move to Barcelona in 2017, it also happened to come in the first season after Mbappe's years-long-trailed transfer from PSG to Madrid.",

      "Which is why Mbappe could consider himself unfortunate to miss out after winning the World Cup with France in 2018 when he placed fourth. The winner that year was Luka Modric, who was runner up in the World Cup with Croatia and won the Champions League with Madrid.",
      "\u201cI did everything I could, but not everything I could to win a Ballon d\u2019Or,\u201d Mbappe said at the time. \u201cIt shows me how much I still have to do to win this trophy or it would be too easy to get there and win it all at once.\u201d",

      "The expectation that Mbappe could dominate the Ballon d'Or was based on the standards set by Messi and Ronaldo, who won it a combined 13 times. It was predicted that he and Man City striker Erling Haaland would develop a similar rivalry, but Yamal's emergence has changed that.",

      "Cale Makar has noticed major changes in college hockey since he left UMass for the NHL five years ago",
      "Cale Makar has difficulty recognizing the college hockey landscape in the wake of a seismic shift that has transformed the sport in the mere five years since he left UMass to join Colorado in the NHL.",
      "From the introduction of name, image and likeness money to the NCAA lifting its ban on Canadian Hockey League players in November, Makar was captivated by the sheer number of players committing to Division I programs this offseason. It seemed like a mass exodus culminating with Gavin McKenna \u2014 the NHL\u2019s prospective 2026 No. 1 draft pick \u2014 committing to Penn State.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a crazy world. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m kind of out of that now,\u201d Makar said. \u201cIt seems like a gong show.\u201d",
      "The path south is familiar for Canadian players like Makar. The two-time Norris Trophy winner as the league's top defenseman left his Calgary hometown to spend two years playing for the Minutemen and was voted college hockey\u2019s MVP in 2019.",
      "What\u2019s changed are the rules, leading to a transformational shift altering the dynamic between the CHL and NCAA in ways not yet entirely realized.",
      "\u201cI wish I had the answer to that,\u201d Washington Capitals assistant GM Ross Mahoney said. \u201cI guess it\u2019ll probably shake itself out in the next three or four years.\u201d",
      "What is clear is that players no longer have to choose before turning 16 whether to go to the CHL or maintain college eligibility in the United States Hockey League or go the Canadian Junior A route. They're now free to play in the CHL before deciding whether to commit to a U.S. college after high school.",
      "The influx of CHL talent should elevate college hockey to an even higher standard.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re witnessing a paradigm shift the size of which college hockey\u2019s never seen,\u201d said Frank Serratore, who's entering his 29th season as coach at Air Force. \u201cLike it\u2019s massive. I tell you what, DI hockey players have always been members of an exclusive club. And that club is about to become even more exclusive.\u201d",
      "Serratore projects CHL players adding depth and displacing players who were previously pegged as third- or fourth-liners.",
      "\u201cMany rosters are going to be unrecognizable from a year ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI've spoken to a lot of coaches who feel their fourth lines this year are going to be as good or better than their second lines.\u201d",
      "The floodgates have opened, with College Hockey Insider reporting nearly 325 CHL players committing to U.S. colleges for this season and beyond.",
      "In turn, the 61 teams making up the CHL umbrella \u2014 the Ontario, Western and Quebec Maritime leagues \u2014 suddenly have a new talent pool of USHL and Junior A prospects to draw from to fill their rosters in what has become a mass redistribution of talent across the continent.",
      "The changing landscape has opened a debate over whether the NCAA will eventually overtake the CHL as the primary feeder of talent to the NHL. Hockey East Conference Commissioner Steve Metcalf believes college hockey now has the edge.",
      "\u201cCurrently the NHL is made up of about one-third of players that come directly from college. That number is going to grow to two-thirds in no time at all,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t been able to find anyone that doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s the track we\u2019re on.\u201d",
      "The numbers were already shifting before the NCAA rule change announced last fall.",
      "Two of the past five No. 1 draft picks, San Jose\u2019s Macklin Celebrini and Buffalo\u2019s Owen Power, are Canadians who chose the USHL before being drafted out of college. Before that, Rick DiPietro in 2000 and Joe Murphy in 1986, were the only two other college hockey players to go No. 1.",

      "\u201cNow the next question is really that next grouping of guys, and how does that work out for them?\u201d he added. \u201cI think you need to see some test cases, so to speak, over the coming seasons to see if (college) is the best way to go.\u201d",
      "Crawford also disputed Metcalf\u2019s two-thirds projection, suggesting it might be a matter of semantics with the CHL and NCAA ultimately sharing the credit.",
      "\u201cI think that there\u2019s actually a harmonious relationship that will inevitably develop between all the stakeholders,\u201d he said.",
      "The CHL provided data indicating of the 150 or so players committing to the NCAA this season, 87% were either skipping their 20-year-old \u201cover-age season\u201d or had already completed their eligibility. And 75% of all players making college commitments this season and beyond fall into the same category.",
      "Meantime, the CHL said nearly 250 players are joining their teams from the USHL and Junior A ranks.",
      "Ideally, prospects have the opportunity to enjoy the best of both worlds. They can spend their first two or three years competing against their peers in the CHL or USHL, before determining whether to further their development in college.",
      "The NHL benefits, too. New Jersey Devils general manager Tom Fitzgerald said his scouts now have more time to evaluate prospects before deciding on whether to sign them.",

      "\u201cI can tell you, we wouldn\u2019t have signed him. He\u2019d be a statistic,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cSo now, he may have a chance in two years.\u201d",
      "The same might one day apply to Marcus Kearsey. The 19-year-old undrafted defenseman chose to spend a fourth season with QMJHL Charlottetown, while committing to play at Northeastern next year.",
      "\u201cAs a captain, I didn\u2019t really feel like I wanted to leave (Charlottetown) after a disappointing year,\u201d Kearsey said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve built so many relationships and I\u2019m pretty comfortable there. But you\u2019ve got to move on eventually,\u201d he added. \u201cSo to have (Northeastern) to go to and know where I\u2019m going to end up next year, it\u2019s really reassuring.\u201d",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Simmering political tensions between India and Pakistan have intensified on the cricket field with the India team refusing to accept the Asia Cup trophy from a senior Pakistani official, having already declined handshakes with their archrival for three consecutive matches.",
      "Tilak Varma\u2019s nerveless half-century helped India beat arch rivals Pakistan at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday and claim its ninth Asia Cup \u2013 second in the T20 format.",
      "But it at the post-match presentation ceremony where tensions reached boiling point.",
      "The ceremony was first delayed for unclear reasons for over one-and-a-half hours. The Pakistan team, led by captain Salman Agha, then arrived late for the ceremony. However, there was a further delay as the Indian team refused to accept the trophy from Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chief of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the Interior Minister of Pakistan.",
      "India\u2019s Twenty20 skipper Suryakumar Yadav claimed that his team was denied the chance to lift the 2025 Asia Cup trophy.",
      "\u201cThis is one thing which I have never seen since I started playing cricket, started following cricket \u2013 a champion team is denied a trophy, that too a hard earned one,\u201d said Yadav in the post-match media conference. \u201cI feel we deserved it. And I can\u2019t say anything more.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you tell me about trophies, mine are sitting in the dressing room, all 14 guys with me, the support staff \u2013 those are the real trophies throughout this journey in the Asia Cup.\u201d",
      "A statement on the ACC website had stated on Saturday that Naqvi would hand over the trophy to the Asia Cup winners. However, it is understood that the Indian team did not want to receive the trophy from him \u2013 in line with their refusal to shake hands with the Pakistan team in any of the three matches the two sides played during the tournament, both at the coin toss and at the end of the match.",
      "While the Indian team had refused to accept the trophy from Naqvi, he reportedly refused to step down from the presentation ceremony altogether. Before the ceremony began, an official also removed the Asia Cup trophy from the presentation podium. No explanation was provided from the ACC for this action.",
      "\u201cLadies and gentlemen, I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight. So that does conclude the post-match presentation,\u201d Simon Doull, former New Zealand cricketer and broadcaster, announced.",
      "This was after Tilak Varma and Abhishek Sharma had collected their individual awards \u2013 player of the match and tournament, respectively. India wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav also collected an award for his bowling performances through the tournament.",
      "All three received their awards from sponsor representatives, and did not acknowledge or shake hands with Naqvi on the presentation stage.",
      "The Pakistan team received its runners-up medals from Aminul Islam, the Bangladesh Cricket Board president, and the check from Naqvi.",
      "Eventually, the Indian team celebrated without the trophy or its individual winners\u2019 medals.",
      "\u201cWe have decided not to take the Asia Cup trophy from the ACC chairman, who happens to be one of the main leaders of Pakistan,\u201d BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told Indian news media outlet, ANI. \u201cBut that does not mean that the gentleman will take away the trophy with him, along with the medals. So it is very unfortunate and we hope that the trophy and the medals will be returned to India as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cThere is an ICC conference in November in Dubai. In the next conference, we are going to launch a very serious and very strong protest against the act of the ACC chairperson.\u201d",

      "Suryakumar was reprimanded for his statements after the first game, while Haris Rauf was penalized for his on-field antics during the second game.",
      "There were no handshakes after Sunday\u2019s final either, or earlier at the toss. Skipper Yadav spoke with former India cricketer-turned-broadcaster Ravi Shastri, while his counterpart Agha talked with former Pakistan cricketer-turned-broadcaster Waqar Younis.",
      "It was quite evident that India was not going to accept the trophy from Naqvi when Agha stood alone beside the winner\u2019s cup after Suryakumar refused to attend the trophy photo shoot before the final.",
      "The Pakistan skipper believed the Indian team not only disrespected Pakistan players by not shaking hands, but they disrespected cricket.",
      "\u201cGood teams don\u2019t do what they did today (by refusing to accept the trophy from Naqvi),\u201d Agha said. \u201cWe went to pose with the trophy on our own because we wanted to fulfil our obligations. We stood there and took our medals. I don\u2019t want to use harsh words but they\u2019ve been very disrespectful.\u201d",
      "Agha claimed the Suryakumar shook hands with him privately before the tournament started three weeks ago when they met each other during the pre-tournament press conferences and in the referee\u2019s meeting.",
      "\u201cBut when they\u2019re out in the world in front of the cameras, they don\u2019t shake our hands. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s following the instructions he\u2019s been given, but if it was up to him, he\u2019d shake hands with me.\u201d",
      "Agha said what the Indian team did during the tournament with Pakistan sent a poor message to the youth of both countries.",
      "\u201cIf a kid is watching in India or Pakistan, we\u2019re not sending them a good message,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople think of us as role models, but if we\u2019re behaving like this, we\u2019re not inspiring them. What happened shouldn\u2019t have happened, but you should ask the people (India) responsible for this rather than me.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Researchers have discovered life-size rock carvings of camels, gazelles and other animals in the Saudi Arabian desert.",
      "The carvings date back to around 12,000 years ago and many are over 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall. Scientists say they were created using a wedge-shaped rock to create sharp lines.",
      "Several were etched on narrow ledges so the artists couldn't even step back to survey the final product as they were working.",

      "More online platforms are giving secondhand shopping a digital upgrade, rolling out features like livestream shopping and AI-powered search to make thrifting faster and more exciting.",
      "Although choosing secondhand over new is often the more sustainable option, experts say it\u2019s not a license to overconsume.

      "Here's how industry experts and fashion-forward shoppers shop secondhand sustainably \u2014 and how to find quality pieces that last while looking cool, too.",
      "At eBay\u2019s secondhand runway shows in New York and London, models wore pre-loved designer pieces that guests could shop live. Secondhand items like those make up 40% of the company's sales, said Alexis Hoopes, eBay\u2019s vice president of fashion.",
      "\u201cOne of our big priorities is making secondhand just as good as shopping in the primary market,\" she said.",
      "ThredUp and The RealReal have reported record sales this year, signaling that the online resale market is growing quickly. Live-auction apps like Whatnot are giving shoppers more platforms to bid on used clothing.",
      "Shoppers navigating growing online options with an eye toward sustainability can still end up buying more than they need.",
      "\u201cPeople who buy secondhand clothing were found to buy more clothing than people who don\u2019t,\u201d said Meital Peleg Mizrachi, a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University who researches textile waste. \u201cNot only that, they tend to get rid of those clothes faster than other consumers. So they\u2019re ending up creating more textile waste because they\u2019re buying more and using that clothing for a shorter period of time.\u201d",
      "Less than 20% of clothing donations to charities are resold in their stores, according to the Council for Textile Recycling. The rest is downcycled, exported \u2014 often to countries in the Global South \u2014 or ultimately discarded in landfills.",
      "Online resale also generates emissions from shipping and packaging, and running massive e-commerce platforms consumes energy, all factors that need to be considered, said Alana James, a fashion professor at Northumbria University. But all of that pales in comparison to the environmental impact of producing a new garment, she said.",
      "Experts say truly sustainable fashion requires breaking away from the fast-fashion mindset \u2014 the constant pressure to \u201cbuy now\u201d and the manufactured sense of scarcity that fuels overconsumption.",
      "\u201cHaul\u201d culture \u2014 the social media trend of showing off massive shopping sprees \u2014 shows overconsumption in a new way, said Katrina Caspelich, communications director for Remake, an advocacy group for human rights and climate justice in fashion.",
      "\u201cResponsible secondhand shopping means choosing pieces you\u2019ll truly wear, investing in quality and resisting the pull of endless trend cycles,\" she said.",
      "It can be difficult to determine quality when shopping online, but asking the seller about the garment\u2019s composition can help, said Wisdom Kaye, a menswear content creator.",
      "Natural fabrics are a good place to start, said Caspelich.",
      "\u201cLook for silk, cotton, bamboo \u2014 things that breathe and last \u2014 versus synthetics like polyester or nylon,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Scientists warn that &ldquo;flying rivers&rdquo; &mdash; invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon &mdash; are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance",
    "story": [
      "Scientists warn that \u201cflying rivers\u201d \u2014 invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon \u2014 are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Droughts have withered crops in Peru, fires have scorched the Amazon and hydroelectric dams in Ecuador have struggled to keep the lights on as rivers dry up. Scientists say the cause may lie high above the rainforest, where invisible \u201cflying rivers\u201d carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean across South America.",
      "New analysis warns that relentless deforestation is disrupting that water flow and suggests that continuing tree loss will worsen droughts in the southwestern Amazon and could eventually trigger those regions to shift from rainforest to drier savanna \u2014 grassland with far fewer trees.",
      "\u201cThese are the forces that actually create and sustain the Amazon rainforest,\u201d said Matt Finer, a senior researcher with Amazon Conservation\u2019s Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP), which tracks deforestation and climate threats across the basin and carried out the analysis.",
      "\u201cIf you break that pump by cutting down too much forest, the rains stop reaching where they need to go.\u201d",
      "Most of the Amazon\u2019s rainfall starts over the Atlantic Ocean. Moist air is pushed inland by steady winds that blow west along the equator, known as the trade winds. The forest then acts like a pump, effectively relaying the water thousands of miles westward as the trees absorb water, then release it back into the air.",
      "Brazilian climate scientist Carlos Nobre was among the early researchers who calculated how much of the water vapor from the Atlantic would move through and eventually out of the Amazon basin. He and colleagues coined the \u201cflying rivers\u201d term at a 2006 scientific meeting, and interest grew as scientists warned that a weakening of the rivers could push the Amazon into a tipping point where rainforest would turn to savanna.",
      "That's important because the Amazon rainforest is a vast storehouse for the carbon dioxide that largely drives the world's warming. Such a shift would devastate wildlife and Indigenous communities and threaten farming, water supplies and weather stability far beyond the region.",
      "The analysis by Finer's group found that southern Peru and northern Bolivia are especially vulnerable. During the dry season, flying rivers sweep across southern Brazil before reaching the Andes \u2014 precisely where deforestation is most intense. The loss of trees means less water vapor is carried westward, raising the risk of drought in iconic protected areas such as Peru\u2019s Manu National Park.",
      "\u201cPeru can do everything right to protect a place like Manu,\u201d Finer said. \u201cBut if deforestation keeps cutting into the pump in Brazil, the rains that sustain it may never arrive.\u201d",
      "Nobre said as much as 50% of rainfall in the western Amazon near the Andes depends on the flying rivers.",
      "Corine Vriesendorp, Amazon Conservation\u2019s director of science based in Cusco, Peru, said the changes are already visible.",
      "\u201cThe last two years have brought the driest conditions the Amazon has ever seen,\u201d Vriesendorp said. \u201cEcological calendars that Indigenous communities use \u2014 when to plant, when to fish, when animals reproduce \u2014 are increasingly out of sync. Having less and more unpredictable rain will have an even bigger impact on their lives than climate change is already having.\u201d",
      "Farmers face failed harvests, Indigenous families struggle with disrupted fishing and hunting seasons and cities that rely on hydroelectric power see outages as the rivers that provide the power dry up.",
      "MAAP researchers found that rainfall patterns depend on when and where the flying rivers cross the basin. In the wet season, their northern route flows mostly over intact forests in Guyana, Suriname and northern Brazil, keeping the system strong.",

      "Finer pointed to roads that can accelerate deforestation, noting that the controversial BR-319 highway in Brazil \u2014 a project to pave a road through one of the last intact parts of the southern Amazon \u2014 could create an entirely new deforestation front.",
      "For years, scientists have warned about the Amazon tipping toward savannah. Finer said the new study complicates that picture.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a single, all-at-once collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain areas, like the southwest Amazon, are more vulnerable and will feel the impacts first. And we\u2019re already seeing early signs of rainfall reduction downwind of deforested areas.\u201d",
      "Nobre said the risks are stark. Amazon forests have already lost about 17% of their cover, mostly to cattle and soy. Those ecosystems recycle far less water.",
      "\u201cThe dry season is now five weeks longer than it was 45 years ago, with 20 to 30% less rainfall,\u201d he said. \u201cIf deforestation exceeds 20 to 25% and warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius, there\u2019s no way to prevent the Amazon from reaching the tipping point.\u201d",
      "Protecting intact forests, supporting Indigenous land rights and restoring deforested areas are the clearest paths forward, researchers say.",
      "\u201cTo avoid collapse we need zero deforestation, degradation and fires \u2014 immediately,\u201d Nobre said. \u201cAnd we must begin large-scale forest restoration, not less than half a million square kilometers. If we do that, and keep global warming below 2 degrees, we can still save the Amazon.\u201d",
      "Finer said governments should consider new conservation categories specifically designed to protect flying rivers \u2014 safeguarding not just land but the atmospheric flows that make the rainforest possible.",
      "For Vriesendorp, that means regional cooperation. She praised Peru for creating vast parks and Indigenous reserves in the southeast, including Manu National Park. But, she said, \u201cthis can\u2019t be solved by one country alone. Peru depends on Brazil, and Brazil depends on its neighbors. We need basin-wide solutions.\u201d",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed into law legislation aiming to increase transparency and prevent AI models from being used to cause catastrophic harms",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday signed a law that aims to prevent people from using powerful artificial intelligence models for potentially catastrophic activities like building a bioweapon or shutting down a bank system.",
      "The move comes as Newsom touted California as a leader in AI regulation and criticized the inaction at the federal level in a recent conversation with former President Bill Clinton. The new law will establish some of the first-in-the-nation regulations on large-scale AI models without hurting the state's homegrown industry, Newsom said. Many of the world's top AI companies are located in California and will have to follow the requirements.",
      "\u201cCalifornia has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive. This legislation strikes that balance,\" Newsom said in a statement.",
      "The legislation requires AI companies to implement and disclose publicly safety protocols to prevent their most advanced models from being used to cause major harm. The rules are designed to cover AI systems if they meet a \u201cfrontier\u201d threshold that signals they run on a huge amount of computing power.",
      "Such thresholds are based on how many calculations the computers are performing. Those who crafted the regulations have acknowledged the numerical thresholds are an imperfect starting point to distinguish today\u2019s highest-performing generative AI systems from the next generation that could be even more powerful. The existing systems are largely made by California-based companies like Anthropic, Google, Meta Platforms and OpenAI.",
      "The legislation defines a catastrophic risk as something that would cause at least $1 billion in damage or more than 50 injuries or deaths. It's designed to guard against AI being used for activities that could cause mass disruption, such as hacking into a power grid.",
      "Companies also have to report to the state any critical safety incidents within 15 days. The law creates whistleblower protections for AI workers and establishes a public cloud for researchers. It includes a fine of $1 million per violation.",
      "It drew opposition from some tech companies, which argued that AI legislation should be done at the federal level. But Anthropic said the regulations are \u201cpractical safeguards\u201d that make official the safety practices many companies are already doing voluntarily.",
      "\"While federal standards remain essential to avoid a patchwork of state regulations, California has created a strong framework that balances public safety with continued innovation,\u201d Jack Clark, co-founder and head of policy at Anthropic, said in a statement.",
      "The signing comes after Newsom last year vetoed a broader version of the legislation, siding with tech companies that said the requirements were too rigid and would have hampered innovation. Newsom instead asked a group of several industry experts, including AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, to develop recommendations on guardrails around powerful AI models.",
      "The new law incorporates recommendations and feedback from Newsom\u2019s group of AI experts and the industry, supporters said. The legislation also doesn't put the same level of reporting requirements on startups to avoid hurting innovation, said state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, the bill's author.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump and his administration have embraced artificial intelligence-generated images, crafting a new official portrait of him",
      "WASHINGTON -- Here he is, depicted at six months in office, chiseled and brawny, as mighty as the very nation. Here he is as a Star Wars Jedi wielding a patriot-red lightsaber, rescuing our galaxy from the forces of evil. Here he is taking over Gaza, transforming the strip into a luxury resort complete with a golden effigy of himself.",
      "You can be anything, perhaps you were told growing up. Doctor. Astronaut. Maybe, one day, the president. But even the chief executive of the United States, the free world\u2019s leader, frames himself as something more epic \u2014 as someone not entirely himself.",
      "On the social media accounts of Donald Trump and his second-term administration, a new official image of the president is emerging bit by bit: one generated artificially.",
      "A sign of the times, certainly \u2014 when the appeal of reimagining yourself with artificial intelligence has trickled up from us everyday citizens. Bored with your selfies? Join a viral trend: There\u2019s an image generator or a chatbot that can turn you into a Renaissance-style painting, a Studio Ghibli character or an action figure with box art and accessories.",
      "Artificial imagery isn\u2019t new for Trump, an early target of AI-generated simulacra who later exploited the technology during his 2024 campaign for the presidency. \u201cIt works both ways,\u201d the Republican president said of AI-generated content at a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIf something happens that\u2019s really bad, maybe I\u2019ll have to just blame AI.\u201d",
      "The AI images of Trump posted by him and his team opt for the alternative \u2014 not deceptive but self-evident in their fictitiousness. Pope Francis dies, and Trump jokes to reporters that he\u2019d like to be pope. A week later, he is, but in an AI-generated image that he posts, reposted by the White House. Trump likens himself to a king in a Truth Social post in February, and AI makes him one in an X post by the White House less than an hour later.",
      "The artifice arrives in Trump\u2019s usual style \u2014 brassy, unabashed, attention-grabbing \u2014 and squares with his social media team\u2019s heavy meme posting, which it has promised to continue. The administration\u2019s official social media accounts have grown by more than 16 million new followers across platforms since Inauguration Day, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "The White House recognizes the appeal. In July, it posted to its X account: \u201cNowhere in the Constitution does it say we can\u2019t post banger memes.\u201d Attached to the post, a photo of a sign on the White House lawn parodying the naysayers: \u201coMg, diD tHe wHiTE hOuSE reALLy PosT tHis?\u201d",
      "Behind the commander in chief\u2019s desire to craft an AI self \u2014 not itself uncommon \u2014 an infantry of official communications channels stands at his ready. And we, the people, can\u2019t help but tune in.",
      "Like so much on the internet these days, Trump\u2019s AI portraits are primed for people to react, says Evan Cornog, a political historian and author of \u201cThe Power and the Story: How the Crafted Presidential Narrative Has Determined Political Success from George Washington to George W. Bush.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy the time you\u2019ve seen it, you\u2019ve understood it. And that\u2019s, of course, the efficacy,\u201d Cornog said. \u201cIt requires no effort, either for the person generating it, but particularly for the person consuming it.\u201d",
      "The expressive power of political imagery, regardless of the truth of its message, has long been understood by politicians and their detractors.",
      "President William Henry Harrison\u2019s log cabin and hard cider campaign symbols, representing him as a \u201cman of the people,\u201d helped him win the election of 1840. Thirty years later, political cartoonist Thomas Nast would turn public opinion against William Marcy \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed with his scathing portrayals of the politician, whom he depicted satirically overweight from greed. \u201cLet\u2019s stop those damned pictures!\u201d Tweed once said, or so the story goes.",
      "The decades since witnessed the birth of photo, film, TV, the internet, computer printers, image-editing software and digital screens that shrank until they could fit in our pockets, making it increasingly easy to create and disseminate \u2014 and manipulate \u2014 imagery.",
      "By contrast, today\u2019s generative AI technology offers greater realism, functionality and accessibility to content creation than ever before, says AI expert Henry Ajder. Not to mention, of course, a capacity for endless automated possibility.",
      "Past presidents \u201chad to actually have fought in a war to run as a war hero,\u201d Cornog says. Now, they can just generate an image of themselves as one. On a horse \u2014 or no, a battlefield. With an American flag waving behind him and an eagle soaring.",

      "The AI images of Trump shared by him and his administration chase a similarly heroic vision of the president. Potency \u2014 his and the country\u2019s \u2014 is a consistent theme, Cornog added.",
      "Indeed, generative AI allows for an exposure of perhaps uncomfortably intimate inner worlds as people use such technology to illustrate and communicate their \u201cfantasy lives\u201d or cartoonish versions of themselves, says Mitchell Stephens, author of \u201cThe Rise of the Image, the Fall of the Word.\u201d",
      "But it can just as easily fulfill an inverse desire: to depict or reinforce a subjective concept of reality.",
      "\u201cQuite a lot of people are sharing AI-generated content, which is clearly fake but is almost seen as a revelatory kind of representation of someone,\u201d Ajder said. This content feeds a mentality that mutters, \u201cWe all know they\u2019re really like this.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so, even if people know it\u2019s fake,\u201d Ajder said, \u201cthey still see it as kind of reflecting and satisfying a kind of truth \u2014 their truth about what the world is like.\u201d",
      "The lack of subtlety in Trump\u2019s AI images of himself helps explain their consistent virality.",
      "Commenters can be found lamenting the demise of presidential decorum (\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day when the White House is just a joke. This is so embarrassing.\u201d) or relishing those very reactions (\u201cWatching the left explode over this has been a treat.\u201d).",
      "Other responses, even from the president\u2019s base, remain unconvinced (as one X user griped under the White House post of Trump as pope: \u201cI voted for you, but this is weird and creepy. More mass deportations and less of whatever this is.\u201d).",
      "But that is tradition for Trump, who finds no trouble cashing the currency of our attention economy: Whether you cracked a smile or clutched your pearls, he still made you look.",
      "\u201cIn his first administration, he used Twitter in a way no president had,\u201d said Martha Joynt Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project, an organization that facilitates the transition between presidents. \u201cWhat they do in this administration is taking it further, as you\u2019ve had an increase in what can be done online.\u201d Or, as one Reddit user referred to the president: \u201cTroll in Chief.\u201d",
      "Does Trump really think he should be pope? Does the White House really think him a king? Accuracy isn\u2019t the point, not for a man who frequently arbitrates what counts as truth. Trump's use of AI sticks to a familiar recipe for bait: crude comedy sprinkled with wishful thinking.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Trump said in May, when asked whether the AI-generated post of him as pope diminished the substance of the official White House account.",

      "As mental health chatbots driven by artificial intelligence proliferate, a small number of states are trying to regulate them",
      "In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI \u201ctherapy\u201d as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice.",
      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.",
      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

      "In March, a Dartmouth University-based team published the first known randomized clinical trial of a generative AI chatbot for mental health treatment.",

      "The study found users rated Therabot similar to a therapist and had meaningfully lower symptoms after eight weeks compared with people who didn't use it. Every interaction was monitored by a human who intervened if the chatbot\u2019s response was harmful or not evidence-based.",
      "Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people.",
      "\u201cThe space is so dramatically new that I think the field needs to proceed with much greater caution that is happening right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Many AI apps are optimized for engagement and are built to support everything users say, rather than challenging peoples\u2019 thoughts the way therapists do. Many walk the line of companionship and therapy, blurring intimacy boundaries therapists ethically would not.",
      "Therabot\u2019s team sought to avoid those issues.",
      "The app is still in testing and not widely available. But Jacobson worries about what strict bans will mean for developers taking a careful approach. He noted Illinois had no clear pathway to provide evidence that an app is safe and effective.",
      "\u201cThey want to protect folks, but the traditional system right now is really failing folks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, trying to stick with the status quo is really not the thing to do.\u201d",
      "Regulators and advocates of the laws say they are open to changes. But today's chatbots are not a solution to the mental health provider shortage, said Kyle Hillman, who lobbied for the bills in Illinois and Nevada through his affiliation with the National Association of Social Workers.",
      "\u201cNot everybody who's feeling sad needs a therapist,\u201d he said. But for people with real mental health issues or suicidal thoughts, \"telling them, \u2018I know that there\u2019s a workforce shortage but here's a bot' \u2014 that is such a privileged position.\u201d",

      "K\u0101rearea, the Indigenous M\u0101ori name for the New Zealand falcon, was crowned Bird of the Year on Monday. But the annual poll, run by conservation group Forest & Bird, is no ordinary online vote.",

      "\u201cBird of the Year has grown from a simple email poll in 2005 to a hotly contested cultural moment,\u201d said Forest & Bird Chief Executive Nicola Toki. \u201cBehind the memes and mayhem is a serious message.\u201d",
      "The contest draws attention to New Zealand\u2019s native bird species, with 80% designated as being in trouble to some degree. But it attracts passionate fandom because New Zealanders are bird-obsessed.",
      "In a country with no native land mammals except for two species of bat, birds reign supreme. They appear in art, on jewelry, in schoolchildren\u2019s songs, and in the name New Zealanders are known by abroad, \u201ckiwis.\u201d",
      "Beloved birds include alpine parrots that harass tourists and pigeons which get so drunk on berries that they sometimes fall out of trees.",

      "Other controversies have struck the poll. In 2021, there was mild uproar when a bat won the title, despite not being a bird.",
      "The vote was ruffled by a foreign influence scandal in 2018 when self-styled comedians in Australia cast hundreds of fraudulent votes for a bird that shares its name with an Antipodean slang term for sex. Voters must now verify the email addresses used to cast their votes.",

      "Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.",
      "\u201cThe reason is very simple: because there\u2019s a lot of money to be made,\u201d said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.",
      "Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Brown said.",

      "However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.",
      "Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.",
      "Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.",
      "Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.",
      "Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.",
      "\u201cIt's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don\u2019t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,\u201d said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.",
      "The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech\u2019s data centers.",

      "On the other side are the state attorney general\u2019s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.",
      "In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price \u2014 $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium \u2014 to affect electric rates.",
      "In essence, Allete \u2014 which solicited bids for a buyout \u2014 argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota\u2019s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.",
      "Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.",
      "However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is \u201cwell positioned\u201d to meet its financing needs.",
      "It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.",
      "In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's \u201cintent to do what private equity is expected to do \u2013 pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.\u201d",
      "In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.",
      "They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.",
      "\u201cFor the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,\u201d the staff wrote. \u201cFor the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity \u2018wins\u2019 and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses \u2013 it is a lose-lose.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Rep. John Moolenaar has requested an urgent briefing from the White House after Trump supported a deal giving Americans a majority stake in TikTok",
      "WASHINGTON -- The chairman of a House committee that pushed for the law demanding TikTok be spun off from its Chinese owners has requested an urgent briefing from the White House, one day after Trump signed an executive order supporting a proposed deal that would put the popular social video platform under U.S. ownership.",
      "In a statement released Friday, Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, praised the proposed deal as \"an important step\u201d in transitioning ownership of the TikTok platform to American hands but he emphasized that \u201cdivestment was not the law's only requirement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance,\u201d Moolenaar said.",
      "The Michigan Republican's statement marks the first congressional effort to conduct oversight into the negotiations over TikTok, coming nearly two weeks after Chinese and American officials met in Spain to discuss a framework divestment deal for TikTok. Trump on Thursday signed an executive order providing support for the deal, and said Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to move forward with negotiations.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to an inquiry from the Associated Press regarding the urgent briefing.",
      "Much is still unknown about the actual deal in the works, but the new U.S. venture would license the famed ByteDance-owned algorithm that currently keeps TikTok users engaged. U.S. tech giant Oracle, a confirmed partner in the U.S. investment consortium that would own TikTok, would audit the copy of the algorithm and monitor it for security purposes.",
      "Vice President JD Vance on Thursday assured the public that the deal would not only keep TikTok operating but also protect Americans' data privacy as required by law. Moolenaar on Friday said he would like to know more.",
      "While algorithms are valuable assets, the real value of TikTok is its users, which is likely why the consortium won\u2019t just start from scratch to build a new app, said computer scientist Bart Knijnenburg, an associate professor at Clemson University who has studied how recommendation systems steer people to online content.",
      "Knijnenburg said all algorithms are biased in some way and if the administration is serious about retraining the TikTok algorithm to avoid Chinese influence, it should push for \u201cradical openness\u201d in TikTok\u2019s mechanics so that users have a window into how bias might be influencing their feeds.",
      "More than politics, Knijnenburg said the biggest problem with TikTok\u2019s algorithm is that it\u2019s geared toward addictive engagement and overuse.",
      "\u201cMoving it to the U.S. is not going to magically solve these types of problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAny company might put undue influence on these applications and from a business perspective, the best way to engage users is to make them addicted to watching these videos, which is not a good idea.\u201d",
      "Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, doubts that the deal, as revealed so far, complies with the law.",
      "\u201cThe law is clear: divestiture means severance, not supervision,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cA board seat for ByteDance or any continued role in maintaining the algorithm would flout Congress\u2019s mandate.\"",
      "Though the details have yet to be finalized, the U.S. investment group\u2019s controlling stake in the new venture would be around 80%. While ByteDance is expected to have a stake in the new venture, it would be less than 20% \u2014 a portion of the ownership reserved for foreign investors. The board running the new platform would be controlled by U.S. investors. ByteDance will be represented by one person on the board, but that individual will be excluded from any security-related matters.",

      "Singleton argues that a board foothold by ByteDance is not merely symbolic. \u201cByteDance\u2019s reported role as the largest single shareholder in a restructured TikTok U.S. venture, combined with a board seat, ensures continuing Chinese influence over the app,\u201d he said. \u201cPlainly put, ByteDance on the board means Beijing in the building.\u201d",

      "That\u2019s a \u201csurprisingly low\u201d valuation, said Daniel Keum, a management professor at Columbia University\u2019s business school.",
      "Keum said it\u2019s possible that \u201cpolitics overrode the business case\u201d or that the licensing structure, which hasn\u2019t yet been disclosed, could have been designed with high fees or profit-sharing that depressed the value of TikTok\u2019s app in the U.S.",
      "Keum said TikTok had an early edge in attracting youth to its innovative video-sharing format, but its competitiveness has \u201cfundamentally eroded\u201d as social media creators and influencers increasingly post their videos on many different apps.",
      "As TikTok\u2019s popularity soared among young Americans in the past several years, U.S. lawmakers grew concerned that Beijing \u2014 viewed by many on the Capitol Hill as the biggest geopolitical rival to the U.S. \u2014 could use the platform to influence public discourse in the United States.",

      "Since then, Europe\u2019s borders have been increasingly tested by rogue drones. Russia has been blamed for some of the incidents, but denies that anything was done on purpose or that it played a role.",
      "NATO jets scrambled on Sept. 10 to shoot down a number of Russian drones that breached Polish airspace, in an expensive response to a relatively cheap threat. Airports in Denmark were temporarily closed this week after drones were flown nearby.",
      "EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius is chairing Friday\u2019s talks. The meeting, via video-link, will include those countries plus officials from Bulgaria, Denmark Romania and Slovakia, along with representatives from Ukraine and NATO.",
      "The aim is to establish what equipment those countries have to counter drone intrusions, what more they might need to plug any gaps along NATO\u2019s eastern flank, and for Kubilius work out where EU funds might be found to help the effort.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Thursday approved a $1.5 billion settlement between artificial intelligence company Anthropic and authors who allege nearly half a million books had been illegally pirated to train chatbots.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup issued the preliminary approval in San Francisco federal court Thursday after the two sides worked to address his concerns about the settlement, which will pay authors and publishers about $3,000 for each of the books covered by the agreement. It does not apply to future works.",
      "\u201cThis is a fair settlement,\u201d Alsup said, though he added that distributing it to all parties will be \u201ccomplicated.\u201d About 465,000 books are on the list of works pirated by Anthropic, according to Justin Nelson, an attorney for the authors.",
      "\u201cWe have some of the best lawyers in America in this courtroom and if anyone can do it, you can,\" Alsup said.",
      "The Association of American Publishers called the settlement a \u201cmajor step in the right direction in holding AI developers accountable for reckless and unabashed infringement.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnthropic is hardly a special case when it comes to infringement. Every other major AI developer has trained their models on the backs of authors and publishers, and many have sourced those works from the most notorious infringing sites in the world,\u201d said Maria A. Pallante, president and CEO of the publisher group.",
      "San Francisco-based Anthropic said it is pleased with the preliminary approval.",
      "\u201cThe decision will allow us to focus on developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems. As we\u2019ve consistently maintained, the court\u2019s landmark June ruling that AI training constitutes transformative fair use remains intact. This settlement simply resolves narrow claims about how certain materials were obtained,\u201d said Aparna Sridhar, deputy general counsel at Anthropic.",
      "The Authors Guild, meanwhile, said the settlement \u201cmarks a milestone in authors\u2019 fights against AI companies\u2019 theft of their works. It sends a clear signal to AI companies that infringement of authors\u2019 rights comes at a steep price and will undoubtedly push AI companies towards acquiring the books they want legally, through licensing.\u201d",
      "A Monday filing sought to convince the judge that the parties have set up a system designed to get out robust notice to all authors and publishers covered by the agreement, ensuring they get their cut of the pot if they want to sign off on the settlement or opt out to protect their legal rights moving forward.",
      "They also tried to assure him that the author and publishers group that cobbled the deal together are not doing any \u201cback room\u201d dealings that would hurt lesser-known authors.",

      "President Donald Trump and a bipartisan group of congressional leaders met at the White House on Monday afternoon to attempt to avoid the looming shutdown.",
      "\"I think we're headed to a shutdown because the Democrats won't do the right thing,\" Vice President JD Vance said following that meeting.",

      "\"They just wanted to kick the health care problem down the road,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters during a news conference at the Capitol.",
      "There have been since the 1977 fiscal year 20 funding gaps, some for as short as a day. If the government shuts down Wednesday, it would be the 21st.",
      "The last shutdown began in December 2018, during Trump\u2019s first term, and was the longest shutdown in history -- 35 days. During that shutdown, some federal workers began showing up at food banks and many essential workers began to call in sick. Union officials said many of them couldn\u2019t afford the childcare or the gas needed to get to work.",
      "By the time the government reopened in January 2019, about $3 billion in U.S. economic activity evaporated, never to be recovered,\u00a0according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Agencies have been slow over the last few days to release contingency plans, but some have warned of potential effects.",
      "Millions would be without pay",
      "If there is a shutdown, as many 4 million federal employees, including some service members, could go without a paycheck. Hundreds of thousands -- including airport security officers, air traffic controllers and certain members of the military -- will be deemed essential workers and told to come to work anyway. ICE agents also go without pay. National parks could close and the Smithsonian museums also typically close within a few days.",
      "Roughly 2 million troops could be forced to work without pay next month, including hundreds of members of the National Guard Trump has deployed to U.S. cities.",
      "Federal contractors, including hourly workers such as janitors and security guards, are not required to work and are also not guaranteed backpay. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill would continue to get paid their $174,000 annual salaries.",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to be distributed, though there can be slow downs.",
      "The FDA can\u2019t ensure that the meat, milk, and eggs of livestock are safe for people to eat.",
      "OMB has not yet given a new estimate of how many Federal workers are expected to go without pay or be furloughed if a shutdown were to happen this time around. However, we have seen OMB Director Russ Vought threatening mass firings, not just furloughing workers, that don\u2019t align with the president\u2019s agenda. Reductions in Force (RIFs) would be a drastic escalation from the fallout of past shutdowns. Democrats have called it an intimidation tactics.",
      "It\u2019s not just workers in and around Washington D.C. who would feel the impacts. 85% of workers operate outside of the city (think federal prisons, courts, national parks, etc).",
      "The Pentagon's contingency plan",
      "Some 2 million troops, including hundreds of National Guard members deployed to U.S. cities as part of President Trump\u2019s crackdown on crime, could be forced to work without pay next month if the government shuts down without passing legislation to spare service members.",
      "Most military personnel are on track to be paid Oct. 1, officials said Monday. But after that, troops would be at the mercy of negotiations on Capitol Hill, which remains at a stalemate.",
      "If Congress can\u2019t reach a deal early in the month to spare the troops as it\u2019s done in the past, Defense Department personnel would be forced to go without pay for what appears to be the first time in decades. In 2018, Coast Guard personnel went without pay as employees of the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "According to a contingency plan posted by the Pentagon this weekend, all active-duty troops would be required to keep working. The plan says contracts can move forward too but under increased scrutiny with priority given to efforts to secure the U.S. southern border and build Trump\u2019s U.S. missile shield, known as \"Golden Dome.\"",

      "National Guard troops may work without pay",
      "National Guard troops deployed to D.C., Oregon and Tennessee would potentially have to work without pay, even if they were under command of their governors. Under the laws mobilizing them, known as Title 10 and Title 32, the missions are federally funded.",
      "The task force overseeing Guard troops in Washington, D.C., said last week that it was aware of the \"potential lapse\" in funding and referred questions to the Pentagon, which hasn\u2019t announced yet whether the Guard deployments would be deemed an \"excepted activity,\" meaning that it\u2019s critical enough to the nation\u2019s security.",

The commanding officers are being summoned to hear Trump and Hegseth talk about the importance of embracing a \"warrior ethos,\" according to sources.",

      "\"Foolish and reckless political leaders set the wrong compass heading and we lost our way. We became the 'Woke Department,' but not anymore,\" he said.",

      "The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) will terminate as scheduled on Tuesday amid uncertainty over renegotiations and the looming impact of new tariffs announced by the White House in April.",
      "AGOA is a multilateral trade agreement that has given thousands of products from qualifying African nations duty-free access to U.S. markets since 2000.",
      "A key example of the deal's impact can be found in Kenya, where it has allowed the country\u2019s textile and apparel sector \u2014 makers of jeans, for instance \u2014 to effectively compete with Asian exporters such as in Bangladesh and Vietnam.",
      "\u201cIf AGOA goes away we have zero chance to compete with the Asian countries,\u201d said Pankaj Bedi, owner of United Aryan, an apparel manufacturer in Nairobi that exports Levi's and Wrangler jeans to the U.S.",

      "AGOA had also given African countries hope that major elements of their export economies would be exempt from blanket tariffs of 10% \u2014 and in some cases much higher \u2014 announced by the U.S. earlier this year.",
      "Kenya is already paying 10% on non-AGOA exports, which are not many. Kenyan manufacturers will struggle to compete with rivals in Asia, even though some Asian countries may face a higher U.S. tariff, because of the limited domestic supply chain in Kenya where most of the raw materials are imported, as well as higher energy costs, lending rates, and operating expenses.",
      "Ruto and other African leaders are pushing for a last-minute renegotiation of AGOA while also scrambling to sign new bilateral agreements with the U.S. They are doing so amid a period of seismic change in global trade dynamics and with a White House that shows a mixed commitment to Africa.",
      "\u201cAfrican countries including Kenya must be alive to the possibility that AGOA won\u2019t be extended, AGOA won\u2019t be remodified, and \u2026 America won\u2019t be interested in having a trade pact,\u201d said Raphael Obonyo, a public policy expert at UN Habitat.",
      "Ruto said last week that Kenya and the U.S had made \u201cgood progress\u201d toward a bilateral agreement that could be signed by the end of this year.",

    "story": [
      "A new lawsuit against Brown University has sparked debate over the secrecy of law enforcement at private colleges",
      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- A new lawsuit against Brown University has renewed questions surrounding the secrecy afforded many law enforcement officers employed by private colleges and universities across the U.S.",
      "Unlike public campuses, private higher education institutions are largely exempt from disclosing arrest records, incident reports and other documents even as they employ officers who have the authority to detain students, as well as, in some cases, use force. This lack of transparency has long raised objections from watchdog groups and open government advocates who say such records are critical to holding law enforcement accountable.",
      "In a recently filed legal challenge, the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island is hoping to make a dent in that practice by arguing that Brown\u2019s police department should comply with the state\u2019s public records law.",
      "\u201cThese private university police officers have the same arrest powers, detention powers, and other powers that any other police officer has in the state working for a city or town,\u201d said Steven Brown, Rhode Island's ACLU executive director. \u201cWe think that in light of that fact, they should be treated the same as public police officers.\u201d",
      "So far Brown has declined to comment on the lawsuit, but their attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the suit.",
      "Connecticut, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Virginia are just the handful of states where private institution\u2019s police departments are subject to public records laws, according to the Student Press Law Center. The rest are largely exempt. In Massachusetts, the state Supreme Court explicitly ruled Harvard University's campus police were not subject to the state's open records laws because they were a private university.",
      "At Brown, the ACLU is representing two journalists who were both denied their public records requests seeking arrest reports made by Brown's officers. ACLU claims Brown's campus police operate under state-authorized police powers, which in turn makes them subject to Rhode Island public records law.",
      "Both reporters, one a former Brown student who wrote for the independent university newspaper and the other a reporter with Motif Magazine, filed complaints with the state hoping to appeal their denial. However, the state attorney general's office issued an opinion siding with Brown police.",
      "\u201cWhenever people are being arrested and criminally charged, state law gives the public \u2014 and therefore the press acting on behalf of the public \u2014 the right and the duty to find out what the police are doing in their name,\u201d said Michael Bilow, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and a reporter with Motif Magazine.",
      "\u201cIf the public and the press can\u2019t find out what the police are doing using the power of the law then what you end up with is a secret police,\u201d he added.",
      "Yet even as access to public records on private campuses may be challenging, these schools are subject to some federal disclosure requirements when it comes to crime data.",

      "Under the Clery Act, colleges and universities that receive federal funding are required to collect data on campus crime and notify students of threats \u2014 something that the majority of both private and public schools accept. Schools must disseminate an annual security report that includes crime reports and information on efforts to improve campus safety.",
      "These reports provide public safety information on their campus, but they're not always comprehensive. Last year, Liberty University agreed to pay the U.S. Department of Education an unprecedented $14 million fine in part for its failure to disclose information about crimes on its campus.",
      "One former Brown police officer, who served at the department for 18 years, says he became increasingly alarmed at the culture he observed. Michael Greco says he witnessed a police force that prioritized limiting negative attention about the school, noting that fellow officers would often refer to the police department as the \u201cQueen's army\u201d dedicated to keeping information inside the \u201cBrown bubble.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt all revolved around this loophole in the law that Brown\u2019s a private institution with police powers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can then take what should be a public record and make it into a private record. And it seems that that was our primary purpose.\u201d",
      "Greco remembered one incident in 2021 where he and fellow colleagues were instructed not to use radios when responding to a possible bomb threat on campus where someone was threatening to \u201cshoot cops.\u201d Greco said the department didn't want to alert Providence police, which monitors the radio and would respond to that type of incident.",
      "While the bomb and shooter ended up being a false alarm, Greco says leadership was unhappy how he later described the incident in his report summarizing the events. Greco has since left the department, and filed a workers' compensation claim against Brown after developing post-traumatic stress disorder that he says he began experiencing after the 2021 incident. The case is being settled, according to court documents.",
      "Greco has since publicly called for more changes inside Brown University, including testifying in front of lawmakers in support of changing state law to explicitly make universities like Brown subject to open records law.",
      "\u201cI think there should be public pressure to get some of this changed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should be held at least to the same standards as a public police department.\u201d",
      "Similar concerns are shared by some of the students also watching college campuses handle high-profile protests and working under President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "\u201cI think there needs to be greater transparency about what\u2019s going on with these arrests on campus, especially at a time when a lot of the public doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening in higher ed and there\u2019s disagreements nationally about the direction of higher ed and what it stands for,\u201d said Audrey Gmerek, a Brown University student.",

      "Gov. Jeff Landry, a Trump ally, asked for up to 1,000 troops through fiscal year 2026 in a letter sent to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. It comes weeks after Trump suggested New Orleans could be one of his next targets for deploying the National Guard to fight crime.",

      "Landry said his request \u201cbuilds on the proven success\u201d of deployments to Washington and Memphis. While Trump has ordered troops into Memphis with the backing of Tennessee's Republican governor, as of Monday night there had yet to be a large-scale operation in the city.",
      "\u201cFederal partnerships in our toughest cities have worked, and now, with the support of President Trump and Secretary Hegseth, we are taking the next step by bringing in the National Guard,\u201d Landry said.",
      "Leaders in Democratic-controlled states have criticized the planned deployments. In Oregon, elected officials have said troops in Portland are not needed.",
      "In his request, Landry said there has been \u201celevated violent crime rates\u201d in Shreveport, Baton Rouge and New Orleans as well as shortages in local law enforcement. He said the state\u2019s vulnerability to natural disasters made the issue more challenging and that extra support would be especially helpful for major events, including Mardi Gras and college football bowl games.",

      "The Utah university where Charlie Kirk was assassinated lacked several key public safety measures and practices that are standard security for events around the country",
      "The Utah college where conservative leader Charlie Kirk was assassinated lacked several key public safety measures and practices that have become standard safeguards for security at events around the country, an Associated Press review has found.",
      "Utah Valley University's outdoor courtyard, where Kirk showed up on Sept. 10 to debate students, was surrounded by several tall buildings, leaving Kirk vulnerable. That was made all the more potent because campus police didn't fly a drone to monitor rooftops or coordinate with local law enforcement to secure the event. It deployed only six officers from a force that was already small for a campus its size. There were no bag checks or metal detectors.",
      "A sniper took position on a nearby roof and killed Kirk with a single shot about 20 minutes after the event began, escaping notice from campus police.",
      "Security at Utah Valley University will come into sharper focus in the coming months as lawmakers and the public seek answers about what could have been done differently.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely there were security failures; it left him exposed,\u201d said Greg Shaffer, who oversaw Kirk\u2019s security from 2015 to 2022. \u201cIt was egregious enough that someone was able to take advantage and kill him.\u201d",
      "In an interview, the AP asked the university president, Astrid Tuminez, if there was a security failure on campus surrounding the Kirk assassination. \u201cSomebody was killed and that\u2019s a tragedy, I think that\u2019s what I would say right now,\u201d she responded. Tuminez declined to answer more detailed questions about campus security, citing a pending external review. A university spokesperson also declined to answer questions about staffing, equipment, security planning and budgets.",
      "The day Kirk spoke at UVU, it was clear and sunny \u2014 the perfect weather for a drone to have had a clear view of the roofs of the surrounding buildings, including where the assassin fired a deadly shot from a bolt action rifle at Kirk from about 400 feet (122 meters) away.",
      "But no drone had been deployed, though security experts said rooftop sniper attacks were a clear threat. That was evident as recently as last year when a rooftop gunman in Butler, Pennsylvania, fired shots at a rally held by President Donald Trump during his campaign, killing one, injuring two and wounding Trump.",
      "Ty Richmond, president of event services for security firm Allied Universal, said the attempted assassination Trump exposed the risk of failing to secure elevated areas. He said drones, which cost as little as $2,000, and video surveillance should be part of the tools used to assess and address threats at any outdoor event.",
      "\u201cIt was either not done comprehensively or not done at all, because that should have been a natural ability to identify and detect any high ground risk and exposures that you would have in a situation like that,\u201d Richmond said.",
      "The UVU campus had numerous cameras, including at least one overlooking the buildings around the courtyard. A university spokesperson declined to say whether someone was actively monitoring it or if it was operating.",
      "UVU has an enrollment of 48,000 students, though Tuminez said that includes 16,000 students who are in high school and don't take classes on campuses.",
      "The university has 23 police officers, or one for every 1,400 on-campus students, according to a 2024 UVU report. The average public university has around one officer for every 500 students, according to a 2024 U.S. Department of Justice study.",
      "\u201cThere is not a campus police department in this country that could provide the level of security necessary for a large scale outdoor event with 3,000 people,\u201d said S. Daniel Carter, a campus safety consultant. \u201cThey would need help, typically from a local law enforcement agency.\u201d",
      "UVU had six campus police officers present at the event along with Kirk\u2019s personal security detail, campus police Chief Jeffrey Long said after the shooting. Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Gray said during a news conference that a UVU police officer had been watching the crowd from an \u201celevated position.\u201d",
      "Officials at the Utah County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Orem Police Department, both of which have drones, said they were not involved in security for the event.",
      "A UVU spokesperson said unlike other schools with larger security staffs, they don\u2019t have dormitories to secure. However, other Utah schools of similar size with largely commuter populations have higher ratios of officers to students.",

      "Weber State University, a mostly commuter public school with more than 33,000 students, about half of whom are also enrolled in high school, has a public safety drone and 41 full and part-time police officers. And the University of Utah, with 36,000 primarily commuter students, has 46 officers.",
      "Overall spending on public safety varied at those universities in 2025 \u2014 $2.3 million at Weber State and $16.2 million at the University of Utah where a 2018 murder of a student led to more spending on security. UVU officials declined to share a current budget for their department, but a legislative audit showed $1.6 million was earmarked for public safety in 2020 out of a nearly $250 million campus budget.",
      "UVU, located between Salt Lake City suburbs and Brigham Young University in Provo, grew from a community college of less than 9,000 in the early 1990s to roughly 48,000 this year thanks to the addition of four-year degrees and campus expansions. But public safety failed to keep up, said two former campus public safety leaders. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared repercussions.",
      "Val Peterson, UVU\u2019s vice president for administration & strategic relations, rejected pleas for more safety resources, including hiring more officers and offering higher salaries to keep skilled personnel, the former public safety leaders said. Peterson, who is also a Republican state lawmaker leading state appropriations, oversees UVU\u2019s public safety and has been with the university for more than 30 years.",
      "Both former campus public safety officials each recalled Peterson telling them multiple times in meetings related to public safety funding about a decade ago that because a shooting had not occurred on campus in decades, it would not happen in the future. Peterson believed the sleepy campus was safe from harm, they said. UVU's president declined to comment on Peterson's alleged remarks.",
      "Former UVU police Sgt. Bryan Cunningham also recalled those comments and, he said, officers warned the administration in budget discussions related to public safety that the campus could be the scene of an \u201cactive shooter nightmare\u201d due to its layout and understaffed police department.",
      "Peterson did not respond to requests for comment sent by phone and email to his private and public offices.",
      "At the time of the shooting, the university was without a fire marshal to help plan for safety at large events. And as recently as 2023, two of the university\u2019s three emergency radio channels did not meet state standards for signal strength, according to an internal review shared with the AP. The review did not include information about the third channel.",
      "Patchy reception was a serious problem that could hamper public safety personnel from coordinating during emergencies, one of the former campus public safety officials noted.",
      "The university boosted the signal at one building in the past year, Utah Communications Authority Executive Director Tina Mathieu said. She was not aware of any other improvements.",
      "A university spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to questions about campus emergency radio signal strength.",
      "Utah lawmakers pushed to improve public school security after the deadly 2022 elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, by creating a task force, appointing a state security chief and requiring an \u201carmed guardian\u201d be present at every public school. They also mandated all K-12 schools conduct rigorous safety assessments.",
      "Rep. Ryan Wilcox, a Republican who chairs the task force, introduced legislation this year to require public universities to conduct the same assessments, but the provision was removed by the state senate.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe the provision in the bill would have changed the outcome of the current situation,\u201d said Republican Sen. Ann Millner, who co-chairs the task force. She said that public universities should be entrusted to implement their own public safety practices \u201caligned with institutional realities\" and that any assessments would likely have taken a long time to complete.",
      "But Wilcox said the lack of mandatory security assessments can allow for vulnerabilities to go unnoticed: \u201cBecause those assessments haven\u2019t been done, I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know about how prepared we are.\"",
      "\"We're going to learn everything we can possibly learn from that,\" he said of Kirk's death. \"It's a complete disaster.\u201d",

      "Victor Tony Jones, 64, is set to receive a lethal injection starting at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison near Starke under a death warrant signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. It would be Florida's 13th death sentence carried out in 2025, further extending the state record for total executions in a single year.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976, the highest previous annual total of Florida executions was eight in 2014. Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, followed by Texas with five. Two more executions are planned next month in Florida.",
      "Jones was convicted and sentenced to death in 1993 on two counts of first-degree murder. Jurors also found him guilty of two counts of armed robbery.",
      "Jones was a new employee at a Miami-Dade business owned by Matilda and Jacob Nestor in December 1990 when he stabbed the wife in the neck and the husband in the chest. Investigators determined that before he died from his wounds, Jacob Nestor managed to retreat to an office. He pulled a .22 caliber pistol from a holster and fired five times, striking Jones once in the forehead.",
      "Police found Jones wounded at the scene with the Nestors\u2019 money and personal property in his pockets. Jones was subsequently hospitalized.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 DoorDash is expanding its offerings, adding restaurant reservations and robot deliveries in some U.S. markets.",
      "The San Francisco-based company, already the largest U.S. delivery provider, announced its expansion plans Tuesday, saying it wants to bring even more business to the merchants it works with and stay ahead of ever-increasing customer demand. DoorDash's total orders jumped 20% to 761 million in the second quarter of this year.",
      "DoorDash's robots will bring new challenges to the company as it takes on the responsibility for storing and maintaining the devices. But DoorDash Co-Founder Stanley Tang said the company needs more delivery options to help fuel its future growth.",
      "\u201cThe shift to autonomy is happening right now, and DoorDash is uniquely positioned to do something like this,\u201d Tang said Monday during an interview at the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters. \u201cWe need to find ways to keep up with the demand. The complexity of the deliveries being made on our platform is increasing too.\"",
      "But DoorDash's plans also threaten other delivery and reservation platforms like OpenTable and Instacart. On Monday, after DoorDash said it would expand its partnership with Kroger to offer delivery from the grocer\u2019s 2,700 U.S. stores, DoorDash's shares jumped 4% while Instacart's fell 10%.",
      "DoorDash said Tuesday that its new \u201cGoing Out\u201d tab will let users book tables at restaurants. Reservations will be offered first in New York and Miami, with other cities to be added later this year. In cities without restaurant reservation capabilities, the \u201cGoing Out\u201d tab will let DoorDash customers earn rewards and in-store offers.",
      "DoorDash said its DashPass members \u2013 who pay $9.99 for free deliveries on most orders \u2013 will also get extra perks, like the ability to reserve exclusive tables.",
      "DoorDash signaled its interest in adding reservations with its recent purchase of SevenRooms, a New York company that makes reservation and hospitality management software. DoorDash announced the $1.2 billion purchase in March.",
      "DoorDash said adding reservations and deals helps it deepen its relationship with restaurants and bring them new patrons. During testing in San Francisco, the company found that 80% of customers using \u201cGoing Out\u201d visited a restaurant they had never ordered food from before.",
      "DoorDash also said Tuesday it will soon begin providing deliveries in Phoenix with an autonomous robot. The robot, which was designed by DoorDash and is dubbed Dot, can reach speeds of up to 20 miles per hour and travel on streets, sidewalks and driveways.",
      "DoorDash has spent the last seven years developing the robot. The company decided to develop its own after finding that other delivery robots on the market, which are mostly designed for short runs on college campuses or urban sidewalks, weren\u2019t capable of operating in the suburban neighborhoods where DoorDash makes many of its deliveries.",

DoorDash has become a ubiquitous service that now operates in more than 30 countries.",

      "Chinese Premier Li Qiang has made a strong case for China's role in global governance at the United Nations General Assembly",
      "WASHINGTON -- Hardly a month after Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed his \u201cGlobal Governance Initiative,\u201d Beijing made its intent clear at the most global of forums \u2014 that it should, and is qualified to, help shape the world order even as the United States tips more inward under Donald Trump.",
      "In a seemingly jargon-filled speech delivered to the U.N. General Assembly on Friday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang told the audience that \u201ca China that bears in mind the greater good of humanity and stands ready to take up responsibilities will bring more positive energy into the world.\" His words seized on the retreat by the American president from international organizations and on his apparent disdain towards the United Nations.",
      "Li never once mentioned the United States by name. But in not-so-subtle swipes at recent actions by the United States, he touted his country's credentials: lowering tariffs to promote global economy, vowing to cut greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change and committing to safeguarding the authority of the United Nations.",
      "It represents a shift in approach to global affairs that experts say reflects a China that sees itself on the ascent.",
      "\u201cLi\u2019s speech confirms that China\u2019s foreign policy posture today is firmly anchored in the ambition of turning a Western-dominant world order into one that is much more conducive to Chinese interests, values, and leadership,\u201d said Olivia Cheung, lecturer in politics at King's College London. \u201cChina\u2019s foreign policy today is notably more confident, strategic, and coherent than how it was in 2017, where Beijing\u2019s presentation of global governance reform lacked content.\"",
      "The speech has come amid growing worries in Washington that China, the world's second-largest economy, might seek to unseat the United States as the global leader, even though Beijing has repeatedly assured Washington that it has no intention to challenge or replace the U.S. Instead, Xi has said Beijing should enjoy a global say befitting of its economic might and global stature.",
      "Li opened his speech by evoking the history of the United Nations and crediting it for the by-and-large peace and prosperity in the ensuing eight decades. Then, he lamented on the \u201cchaos\u201d the world is faced with today.",
      "\u201cThe world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation,\u201d Li said, leveling his criticisms at \u201cunilateralism and Cold War mentality\" and repeated disruptions to the international system.",
      "\u201cHow could we, when confronted with unscrupulous acts of hegemonism and bullying, remain silent and submissive for fear of might?\u201d the Chinese premier asked. The terms \u201cunilateralism,\u201d \u201cCold War mentality,\u201d \u201chegemonism\u201d and \u201cbullying\u201d are usually associated with the U.S. in Beijing's diplomatic talks.",
      "Then, the Chinese premier portrayed China as a desirable answer to such problems \u2014 a founding member of the United Nations that has in recent years shared \u201cChina\u2019s wisdom and solution for navigating global transformations and overcoming pressing challenges.\u201d",
      "The Global Governance Initiative, as proposed by Xi in early September, \u201cpoints the right direction and provides an important pathway for building a more just and equitable global governance system,\u201d Li said.",
      "The reframing is, on some levels, fundamental.",
      "In a podcast aired Sept. 26, Cheung told the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations that Beijing's strategic thinking has shifted under Xi \u2014 from maintaining good ties with the U.S. and other Western nations for China's economic growth to \u201creshaping the international system so that the rest of the world respect and accept China\u2019s interest in the way that Beijing defines it.\"",

      "What Beijing is most interested in, Cheung said, is \u201cchanging global governance in a way that puts the United Nations front and center\u201d where China can have \u201ca lot more involvement and influences and leverage in how it functions.\u201d",
      "Li's speech Friday conveys the impression that Xi's proposition of \u201cforging the common destiny for humankind\u2019 is not only an aspiration but \u201dpolicy actions that are noble and urgent, with which China uniquely has strong technical competencies to lead,\" Cheung told the Associated Press.",
      "As the Trump administration imposes steep tariffs, threatens territorial annexations and goes after multilateral institutions, \u201cChina seeks to present itself as a key upholder of a postwar order in whose viability the United States seems to be losing confidence\u201d, said Ali Wyne, a senior research and advocacy advisory for U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group.",
      "But China does not appear to have either the capacity or the desire to offer a wholesale alternative, Wyne said. Instead, he said, China appears interested in deepening its influences in certain areas and attempting to legitimize its longstanding contention that new norms are needed to reflect emerging geopolitical trends.",
      "The gulf between Beijing's words and its actions is another question. Where the Chinese government is concerned, its action often fails to align with its word, said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China Program at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies.",
      "\u201cPremier Li\u2019s remarks leaned heavily on multilateral language, but Beijing\u2019s track record tells a different story,\" Singleton said. \u201cChina champions sovereignty at the U.N. while systematically eroding it in practice, from Hong Kong to the South China Sea.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cLi\u2019s calls for \u2018cooperation\u2019 and \u2018openness\u2019 sound constructive, but they\u2019re designed to blunt pressure on China\u2019s economy and technology sector.\"",
      "A day earlier, Li held a meeting with American businesspeople and scholars in New York. He assured the group that China would \u201ccontinuously expand market access and increase imports\u201d and provide foreign businesses with \u201cthe certainty they need to operate and develop in China,\u201d according to a Chinese government statement.",
      "The two countries are locked in a trade dispute, and Xi and Trump are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping of 21 economies, to be held at the end of October in South Korea, to help recalibrate bilateral relations.",
      "The Chinese premier said the two countries \u201ccould and should\u201d become partners and friends, and he repeated a line from Xi: \u201cThe Pacific Ocean is vast enough to accommodate both China and the United States, as well as other countries.\"",

      "Lt. Col. George Hardy, the youngest fighter pilot of the Tuskegee Airmen, the nation's first Black military pilots, has died. He was 100.",
      "Hardy was the last surviving combat pilot of the Tuskegee Airmen who went overseas. He died last week, according to Tuskegee Airmen Inc.",
      "\u201cHis legacy is one of courage, resilience, tremendous skill and dogged perseverance against racism, prejudice and other evils,\u201d Tuskegee Airmen Inc. said in a Facebook post.",
      "Born in Philadelphia, Hardy was a dedicated student who dreamed of becoming an engineer and never planned on joining the military. He was intrigued after his brother joined the U.S. Navy, but still pursued a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and a master\u2019s degree in systems engineering from the U.S. Air Force Institute, according to the National WWII museum.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until 1941 when the Army started opening the door for us to be pilots and whatnot. And we walked through the door and had a great opportunity, and we took advantage of it,\u201d Hardy told AVI-8, an \u201caviation-inspired\u201d watch manufacturer, in an interview.",
      "Prior to World War II, Black Americans were not allowed to serve in the Air Force. But in 1941, the Tuskegee Airmen unit was established by the U.S. Army Air Corps as the 99th Pursuit Squadron based at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. The military pilots served in a segregated World War II unit and their all-Black 332nd Fighter Group had one of the lowest loss records of all the bomber escorts in the war.",
      "Several white leaders in the U.S. Army Air Forces tried to prevent Black pilots from combat duty and banned them from using their club spaces, spurring civil disobedience from Tuskegee Airmen.",
      "Hardy was commissioned as a second lieutenant at 19 and flew his first combat mission before he had ever driven a car, he told AVI. He ultimately completed 21 World War II missions and also served in the Korean War and Vietnam War.",
      "Brian Smith, president and CEO of the Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum, described Hardy as a \u201chumble man\u201d with a passion for aviation. He was passionate about encouraging young people to become pilots and up until recent years he often attended air shows, Smith said.",

      "The Marine Corps is now touting that it hit its recruiting goals this year",
      "QUANTICO, Va. -- The Army, Navy and Air Force, with encouragement from the Trump administration, all announced this summer that they had met their recruiting goals months ahead of schedule.",
      "That is a major shift from the past several years when the military has failed to meet its recruiting goals because of complications from the COVID-19 pandemic, tight job markets and a growing generation of young Americans struggling to meet fitness and academic standards. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed the turnaround as an early victory, arguing that recruits had been put off by what he called a weakened military under Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "However, the uptick began well before President Donald Trump won office again in November, and a major driver has been programs the services started years ago to boost numbers.",
      "While the Marine Corps didn't wade into the fray earlier, it is now claiming success. And the general in charge of the effort says the politics of the moment have had no impact on Marine recruiting.",
      "\u201cThe Marines are probably the most inelastic of the services,\u201d Lt. Gen. William Bowers told The Associated Press this month. \u201cWe appeal to a certain type of young man or woman \u2014 that really doesn\u2019t change with the economic winds.\"",
      "\"They want to be part of that mystique,\u201d he added.",
      "Data provided by the Corps shows that it has recruited 30,536 active duty and reserve enlisted Marines \u2014 just one person over its annual goal. It also recruited 1,792 active duty and reserve officers, beating its goal by two people.",
      "Officials say the figures are not the result of a struggle to meet the numbers but a reflection of how careful the Corps has to be in not overrecruiting.",
      "Bowers said that when he took the job as deputy commandant for manpower and reserve affairs, he moved the date for 500 recruits to head to boot camp until after September to avoid the Marines growing past their congressionally authorized size.",
      "Formal recruiting figures for all the military services are typically announced after the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.",
      "The Marines also beat enlisted recruiting goals by a single person last year. The service made its enlisted recruiting goal by 351 Marines in 2023, when the Army, Navy and Air Force all missed their targets by thousands of recruits. The Army alone came up about 10,000 short.",
      "However, the Corps in 2022 also had to dip into its pools of delayed-entry applicants \u2014 the same pool Bowers is now bolstering \u2014 to make its goals.",
      "The Marines have not altered their entry requirements and are \u201cunapologetic\u201d about their standards.",
      "\u201cEverywhere I\u2019ve been in the country, the American people know the Marine Corps has very high standards and that we stick to them,\u201d Bowers said. He added, \u201cIf you try to appeal to everybody, you won\u2019t get the people you maybe really want.\u201d",
      "But there is also an inherent contrast with the other military services.",

      "Army and Navy officials said none of those programs is a lowering of standards.",
      "The Corps doesn\u2019t offer the lavish cash bonuses that some services do to attract recruits. The U.S. military overall spent more than $2 billion over the past three years to recruit service members, with the Corps accounting for just over 2.5%, or about $51 million, of that.",

      "Colombia's foreign minister has renounced her U.S. visa to protest the U.S. State Department's decision to revoke Colombian President Gustavo Petro's visa",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombia's foreign minister has \u201crenounced\u201d her U.S. visa to protest a decision by the U.S. State Department to revoke the visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro, the Colombian government said Monday.",
      "The decision by Foreign Minister Rosa Villavicencio comes as tensions between both nations escalate over issues that include drug policy, the war in Gaza and a U.S. naval buildup in neighboring Venezuela.",
      "Colombia's Foreign Affairs Ministry did not respond to questions about what kind of visa Villavicencio held, but said in a statement that it was not interested in \u201cdiplomatic visas that limit opinions\" or curtail the nation's \"sovereignty.\u201d",
      "Later on Monday, Colombian Finance Minister Germ\u00e1n \u00c1vila wrote in an X message that he would stop using his visa in \u201csolidarity\u201d with Petro, and because of the \u201caggression\u201d he was subjected to by the United States. \u201cTo work for our people, we do not need visas\u201d \u00c1vila wrote.",
      "The U.S. State Department revoked Petro\u2019s visa Friday after he participated in a protest in New York against the war in Gaza, in which Petro called for the creation of an international army to liberate the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.",
      "Holding a megaphone and wearing a kaffiyeh, the traditional Palestinian scarf, Petro called on U.S. soldiers to \u201cdisobey\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s orders, adding that they should \u201cnot point their rifles against humanity.\"",
      "Hours after the protest, the State Department said on social media that it would cancel Petro\u2019s visa \u201cdue to his reckless and incendiary actions.\u201d",
      "Petro was back in Colombia when the visa announcement was made, after having spent several days in New York attending the U.N. General Assembly. He wrote on X that he \u201cdidn\u2019t care\u201d about the punishment because he is also an Italian citizen, and could possibly travel to the U.S without a visa.",
      "The revocation of Petro\u2019s visa marks a new low in the leftist leader\u2019s relations with the Trump administration, which earlier this month placed Colombia on a list of countries that it says are not fulfilling their international commitments to curb drug trafficking.",
      "Geoff Ramsey, a Colombia analyst at the Atlantic Council, said the foreign minister's decision to ban herself from visiting the United States places more obstacles in the relationship. He said it also reflects an effort by the Petro administration to distance itself from the U.S. government, as Colombia heads into congressional and presidential elections next year.",
      "\u201cPetro is not even remotely interested in repairing the relationship with Washington,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly betting that confrontation with Trump will score points for his coalition in the upcoming election cycle, and is willing to torch the bilateral relationship with the United States in the process.\u201d",

      "Louisiana has issued a warrant to arrest a California doctor accused of mailing abortion pills",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana is pursuing a criminal case against another out-of-state doctor accused of mailing abortion pills to a patient in the state, court documents filed this month revealed.",
      "A warrant for the arrest of a California doctor is a rare charge of violating one of the state abortion bans that has taken effect since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and allowed enforcement.",
      "It represents an additional front in a growing legal battle between liberal and conservative states over prescribing abortion medications via telehealth and mailing them to patients.",
      "Pills are the most common way abortions are accessed in the U.S., and are a major reason that, despite the bans, abortion numbers rose last year, according to a report.",
      "Louisiana said in a court case filed Sept. 19 that it had issued a warrant for a California-based doctor who it says provided pills to a Louisiana woman in 2023.",
      "Both the woman, Rosalie Markezich, and the state attorney's general, are seeking to be part of a lawsuit that seeks to order drug regulators to bar telehealth prescriptions to mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions.",
      "In court filings, Markezich says her boyfriend at the time used her email address to order drugs from Dr. Remy Coeytaux, a California physician, and sent her $150, which she forwarded to Coeytaux. She said she had no other contact with the doctor.",
      "She said she did not want to take the pills but felt forced to and said in the filing that \u201cthe trauma of my chemical abortion still haunts me\u201d and that it would not have happened if telehealth prescriptions to the drug were off limits.",
      "The accusation builds on a position taken by anti-abortion groups: That allowing abortion pills to be prescribed by phone or video call and filled by mail opens the door to women being coerced to take them.",
      "\u201cRosalie is bravely representing many woman who are victimized by the illegal, immoral, and unethical conduct of these drug dealers,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement.",
      "Murrill's office did not immediately answer questions about what charges Coeytaux faces, or when the warrant was issued. But under the state's ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, physicians convicted of providing abortion face up to 15 years in prison and $200,000 in fines.",
      "Coeytaux is also the target of a lawsuit filed in July in federal court by a Texas man who says the doctor illegally provided his girlfriend with abortion pills.",
      "Email and a telephone message seeking comment were left for Coeytaux.",
      "The combination of a Louisiana criminal case and a Texas civil case over abortion pills is also playing out surrounding a New York doctor, Margaret Carpenter. New York authorities are refusing to extradite Carpenter to Louisiana or to enforce for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton the $100,000 civil judgment against her.",
      "In the Louisiana case, officials said a pregnant minor\u2019s mother requested the abortion medication online and directed her daughter to take them. The mother was arrested, pleaded not guilty and was released on bond.",
      "New York officials cite a law there that seeks to protect medical providers who prescribe abortion medications to patients in states with abortion bans \u2014 or where such prescriptions by telehealth violate the law.",

      "U.S. House members have met in North Carolina's largest city to hear from families of violent-crime victims and others",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- U.S. House members visited North Carolina's largest city on Monday to hear from family members of violent-crime victims who pleaded for tougher criminal justice policies in the wake of last month's stabbing death of a Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte commuter train.",
      "A judiciary subcommittee meeting convened in Charlotte to listen to many speakers who described local court systems in North Carolina and South Carolina that they say have failed to protect the public and keep defendants in jail while awaiting trials.",
      "The meeting was prompted by the Aug. 22 stabbing death of Iryna Zarutska on a light rail car and the resulting apprehension of a suspect who had been previously arrested more than a dozen times, according to court records.",
      "\u201cThe same system that failed Mary failed Iryna. Our hearts are broken for her family and her friends and we grieve with them,\u201d Mia Alderman, the grandmother of 2020 murder victim 20-year-old Mary Santina Collins in Charlotte, told panelists. Alderman said defendants in her granddaughter's case still haven't been tried: \u201cWe need accountability. We need reform. We need to ensure that those accused of heinous crimes are swiftly prosecuted.\u201d",
      "A magistrate had allowed the commuter train defendant, Decarlos Brown Jr., to be released on a misdemeanor charge in January on a written promise to appear, without any bond. Now Brown is jailed after being charged with both first-degree murder in state court and a federal count in connection with Zarutska\u2019s death. Both crimes can be punishable by the death penalty.",
      "Public outrage intensified with the release of security video showing the attack, leading to accusations from Republicans all the way to President Donald Trump that policies by Democratic leaders in Charlotte and statewide are more focused on helping criminals than victims. Democratic committee members argued that Republicans are the ones who have reduced crime-control funds or failed to provide funding for more district attorneys and mental health services. Brown\u2019s mother told media outlets that her son has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.",
      "\u201cThe hearing for me is not really about public safety,\u201d Democratic Rep. Alma Adams, who represents most of Charlotte. \u201cIt\u2019s about my colleagues trying to paint Democrats as soft on crime \u2014 and we're not \u2014 and engaging in political theater, probably to score some headlines.\u201d",
      "Dena King, a former U.S. attorney for western North Carolina during Joe Biden's administration, testified that Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, needs dozens of additional prosecutors to serve effectively a county of 1.2 million people. And a crime data analyst said that rates of murder and violent crime are falling nationwide and in Charlotte after increases early in the 2020s.",
      "Republicans, in turn, blasted Democratic members, saying additional funding alone wouldn't have prevented the deaths of Zarutska or the other homicide victims highlighted Monday. And they attempted to question the crime figures as misleading.",

      "They filed their sentencing recommendation shortly after midnight, including letters from some of his accusers describing how his violence and demands had impacted their lives.",
      "Prosecutors called Combs \"unrepentant\" and said Combs had conceded his acts of violence and abuse throughout his trial but \"incredibly ... he now argues that his victims should shoulder the blame.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has remained jailed since his July conviction on charges related to arranging male sex workers to travel to hotels or residences where he directed them to have sex with his girlfriends.",
      "The elaborate dayslong, drug-fueled sexual events were often filmed by Combs. Defense attorneys have asked that he be sentenced to no more than 14 months in prison. Sentencing is set for Friday. The music mogul had pleaded not guilty to all of the charges brought against him.",
      "In July, Combs was convicted of two charges for violating the Mann Act, which outlaws interstate commerce related to prostitution, for arranging the paid sexual encounters between his girlfriends and male sex workers. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.",
      "The same jury acquitted the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that could have resulted in a life sentence.",
      "Last week, the defense submitted its presentence arguments, saying Combs has suffered enough during his nearly 13 months behind bars and that he should be freed soon.",

I testified that from age nineteen, Sean Combs used violence, threats, substances, and control over my career to trap me in over a decade of abuse.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Italian actress Claudia Cardinale (April 15, 1938-Sept.\u00a023, 2025) starred in more than 100 films and TV productions, and was best known for her roles in Federico Fellini's \"8\u00bd,\" and Luchino Visconti's \"The Leopard.\" She was also a U.N. goodwill ambassador for women's rights.",
      "The daughter of Sicilian parents, her career began after winning a beauty pageant in Tunisia at age 17. That led to a trip to the Venice Film Festival, and offers to appear in movies. She turned them down, at first. \"It's like a man,\" she told The Guardian in 2013. \"When he's going after you, if you say yes immediately, after a little time he goes away. If you say no, he desires you for a long time.\"",
      "Often compared to Brigitte Bardot, Cardinale found success working with such directors as Mario Monicelli (\"Big Deal on Madonna Street\"), Luchino Visconti (\"Rocco and His Brothers,\" \"The Leopard,\" \"Conversation Piece\"), Sergio Leone (\"Once Upon a Time in the West\") and Werner Herzog (\"Fitzcarraldo\").",
      "She appeared in some Hollywood productions, including \"The Pink Panther\" with Peter Sellers, \"Circus World\" with John Wayne, \"Don't Make Waves\" with Tony Curtis, and \"The Professionals\" with Burt Lancaster. But she refused to sign exclusivity contracts with American studios, and so the majority of her appearances were in international films.",
      "A staple of Italian and French cinema, she continued working into her 80s. Of her roles, which extended from the sultry to the grand dame, she proudly said in 2013, \"I was never naked and I never did anything to change my face. I don't like that at all. I like to be what I am, because you cannot stop time.\""

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 17:01:40 -0400",
    "summary": "His music dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, as an early bandmate of Buddy Holly, and the writer of such classic songs as \"I Fought the Law.\" But Sonny Curtis' most memorable composition may be a TV theme song that turned the world on with a smile.",
    "story": [
      "The theme song to \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" is familiar to generations of TV watchers. The name of the man who wrote and sang it, less so.",
      "Who can turn the world on with her smile?Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?Well, it's you, girl, and you should know itWith each glance and every little movement you show it",
      "Love is all around, no need to waste itYou can have the town, why don't you take itYou're gonna make it after all",
      "But by the time Sonny Curtis recorded \"Love Is All Around\" in 1970, he'd \"made it\" several times over himself, as a songwriter, as a recording artist, and as an early bandmate of the legendary Buddy Holly.",
      "Born in 1937 in rural West Texas, Curtis grew up picking cotton on his father's farm. \"Oh, it was a miserable job,\" he told correspondent Mo Rocca. \"The heavier the cotton sack gets, the worse it is, man.\"",
      "His love of music came from family. His aunt taught him to play the guitar, and while working those fields, Curtis dreamed up his own songs: \"Driving a tractor, you go down half a mile that way, and when you get there, you turn around and come back a half mile this way. You have plenty of time to write a song!\"",
      "Curtis was just 14 when he met a young Buddy Holly in nearby Lubbock. \"Buddy had black hair, but he had dyed it blonde, and it was growing out. And he reminded me of a black-and-tan coon hound. We sorta skipped all the niceties and got our guitars and started playing.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"How quickly did you realize this guy's serious about music?\"",
      "\"Buddy, he exuded confidence. He just knew he was gonna make it big one day.\"",
      "The two became fast friends, bonded by their love of music. Sometimes, Curtis said, he'd spend the night at Buddy's. The two would wake up at midnight and flip on the car radio for a show out of Shreveport, Louisiana, to hear some of the rhythm and blues voices that would shape rock 'n' roll: \"We heard, oh, Big Mama Thornton and Lonnie Johnson, and Lead Belly, Little Richard, Ray Charles, you name it.\"",
      "\"Were you just absorbing this?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"Oh, boy, were we ever, yeah!\"",
      "Buddy and Sonny had formed a band and were still figuring out their own sound, when a then little-known Elvis Presley came to town. \"And I mean, the girls were goin' nuts, man. And that really got our attention. All a sudden, we thought, this not only involves music, this involves pretty girls!\"",
      "When Elvis came back to town in 1956, Buddy and Sonny's band was the opening act. \"Well, I guess we were right there sort of at the beginning of rock 'n' roll.\"",
      "\"What was Elvis like backstage?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"He was just an old boy.\"",
      "The band went on to record some demos, but wasn't making much money.",
      "So, Curtis left to tour with country star Slim Whitman. \"He treated me kind of like a little brother,\" Curtis said. \"I remember I'd be on the stage and he'd come over and say, 'Now don't be nervous.'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Buddy Holly formed a new band, which would prove to be seminal. The Crickets shot to fame, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"When that was happening, did you feel a little left out, like, 'Ugh'?\"",
      "\"I did feel kind of like the train left the station and I wasn't on it, you know?\" Curtis replied.",
      "But on February 3, 1959, Curtis' friend and former bandmate died in a plane crash near Clear Lake Iowa.",
      "Curtis served as a pallbearer.",
      "\"Buddy Holly was 22 when he died,\" Rocca said.",
      "\"Yes. Can you imagine the amount of music he pumped into the system in a short period of, like, 18 months? No telling how much he would've contributed had he been around.\"",
      "By that time, Curtis had joined the Crickets. But with Holly gone, the band felt rudderless.",
      "It was Curtis' talent for songwriting that helped put the wind back in his sails. His song \"Walk Right Back'' became a big hit for the Everly Brothers:",
      "And then there's this classic, which Curtis claims he wrote in about 20 minutes: \"I Fought the Law\":",
      "\"I Fought the Law\" has been covered by artists from The Bobby Fuller Four to The Clash.",
      "Sonny Curtis is 84 now. He and Louise, his wife of more than 50 years, live outside Nashville, where they raised their daughter, Sarah. He is enshrined in Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame \u2013 as is his old guitar.",
      "In 2012, the year the Crickets retired, they were inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.",
      "But it's a song Curtis wrote for the small screen that may be his most enduring legacy.",
      "In 1970, he was living in Los Angeles when he got a call from a friend about a new sitcom being produced for Mary Tyler Moore: \"It was just this young girl gets jilted in this small community, and she moves to the big city of Minneapolis, gets a job at a news station. And that was about it.\"",
      "Curtis wrote the theme song based on a four-page description of the show. \"I honed in on the part that she rented an apartment she had a hard time affording, and wrote, 'How will you make it on your own?' \u2026 'This world is awfully big, and girl, this time you're all alone.'\"",
      "Within just a few hours, Curtis was summoned to the studio to play his song for producer James L. Brooks. Curtis recalled, \"I got my guitar out and I sang it to him. He smiled and said, 'Sing that again.' And I had to sing it about ten times. And before I left that afternoon, the room was full of people standing all around the walls. I thought, 'I believe I got a shot at this!'\"",
      "WEB EXTRA: Sonny Curtis on writing the \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" theme song",
      "Rocca said, \"It wasn't a given that you'd write and sing it.\"",
      "\"No. As a matter of fact they didn't want me to sing it. I said, 'I wanna sing this,' you know? And I was probably more pushy than I should have been, if I'da known better. But fortunately, I didn't know better at the time!\"",
      "When the show became a hit, Curtis was asked to rework his song: \"When they started to do the second season, he said, 'Sonny, she's obviously made it. And we have to have some new lyrics.'\"",
      "For a man whose career dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, Sonny Curtis remains disarmingly humble. \"Oh, I've always sort of had a rule, don't give advice in a crowd,\" he laughed.",
      "But when pressed, he will share some wisdom: \"If they say, 'Man, you oughta go back to Texas 'cause you'll never make it,' just look at them and say, 'No, you're wrong, because I am gonna make it.'\"",
      "Rocca replied, \"You know, I should write this down, 'cause this sounds like a song right here!\"",

      "The British singer-songwriter rose to fame in the 1960s and put his career on hold for two decades after converting to Islam in the late 1970s. He returned to secular music in the 2000s.",

Rower said, \"My grandfather realized you could draw a figure in a wire \u2013 like, a two-dimensional drawing but expanded in three dimensions. Make a volumetric drawing of a person, a portrait, or an acrobat, or an animal, or some scene, and creating something that was experienced by people in a very different way than you would a solid mass.\"",
      "Just like the garden's namesake, the space embraces the unconventional.",
      "\"I'm trying to work with my grandfather's own idea, where he doesn't predispose you to a certain outcome,\" Rower said. \"He'd like to create a forum where there's an object in space, and you enter that space.

    "story": [
      "Remember when radio DJs used to say a hit song was \"number one with a bullet\"?\u00a0 Well, this one was the slowest bullet in rock history. \"Time of the Season,\" by The Zombies, released in March 1968, reached #3 on the Billboard charts a full year later.",
      "Rod Argent and Colin Blunstone are in their 80s now. In their teens they were members of The Zombies, part of the 1960s British pop invasion that began with The Beatles, except that, for The Zombies, success took a lot longer to catch up with them.",
      "Of the five original Zombies, four survive: Argent, Blunstone, Hugh Grundy and Chris White. The fifth member, Paul Atkinson, died in 2004.",
      "\"We were friends, really, right from the very start,\" said Agent.",
      "\"It just clicked, yeah, it really did,\" said Grundy.",
      "White added, \"And we're still friends!\"",
      "They first got the band together at a youth club in their hometown just north of London, where a local artist has now finally put up a mural of them.",
      "But boy, was it a bumpy road to rock 'n' roll immortality.",
      "The first song Argent wrote was \"She's Not There,\" about unrequited adolescent love (is there another kind?). It was the making of them.",
      "\"She's Not There\" made it onto \"Juke Box Jury,\" a British is-it-a-hit-or-a-miss TV show, where one of the panelists loved it: \"I think it's a hit,\" he said. That panelist was George Harrison of The Beatles. It didn't hurt.",
      "The song went to #1 on the Cash Box chart, and #2 in Billboard.",
      "\"It was on the 9 o'clock news,\" said Argent. \"They said The Zombies had become the first group after The Beatles to have a number one record with a self-written composition\" - the song Argent wrote - \"Yeah, I'm in heaven!.\"",
      "\"She's Not There\" wasn't just a hit; it was their ticket to ride. They went to America, and hit the road with the Dick Clark Caravan of Stars. \"This was a dream come true for us,\" said Blunstone.",
      "Grundy said, \"We were terrified because here we were taking a lot of their influence, and there we were on stage with these fabulous artists going, 'Can we do this, can we even play with them?'\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel you were being imposters bringing American-style rhythm and blues music back to America?\"",
      "\"With English accents!\" said White.",
      "\"We thought exactly that,\" Argent replied. \"But they saw us as doing something really quite different. But we realize now that we did really have something quite original. We really did have our own stamp.\"",
      "But there was a problem: Money. There wasn't any.",
      "Blunstone said, \"We were 19 years old, we were very na\u00efve, and we didn't realize what our options were. So, I'm afraid that touring revenue was poor. Sometimes non-existent!\"",
      "Not only that, they felt their music had stagnated and suffered. They decided to produce their own album, in their own way. They went to the mothership of British rock, the famous Abbey Road Studios in London.",
      "Returning there, Blunstone said, \"You do get this really emotional feeling walking into it. Because, I mean, there's so much history in these walls.\"",
      "The session produced what became their signature album, \"Odessey and Oracle,\" now considered one of rock 'n' roll's greats. But not then. Then, it sank without a trace. \"There was no real interest in us,\" Argent said.",
      "Blunstone said, \"I thought we had a chance, but it became fairly clear fairly quickly that the industry pretty much ignored it, really.\"",
      "The Zombies thought it was all over and broke up. Blunstone took a job in insurance. Grundy sold cars. White and Argent wrote songs for other people, including this one for Argent's new band: \"Hold Your Head Up.\"",
      "But \"Odessey and Oracle\" wouldn't die. More than a year later, one of the tracks, \"Time of the Season,\" started to get some play.",
      "\"Famously there was one DJ in Boise, Idaho who kept playing 'Time of the Season,'\" said Blunstone. \"It spread to other radio stations. It took months for it to be a hit, but again, it went to number one in Cash Box.\"",
      "Finally, more than 50 years after their hits, The Zombies made it into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; and now, a remastered version of \"Odessey and Oracle\" has been released.",
      "\"Now,\" said Blunstone, \"it gets name-checked as a major influence in so many people's careers.\"",
      "\"Considered a Top 50 rock album, iconic rock album,\" I added.",
      "\"I know! And here we are. Is it nearly 70 years later? It's a very strange story.\"",

    "story": [
      "The first thing you notice about Jennifer Lopez' perch over West Hollywood is the Old Hollywood part of it. Images of Barbra Streisand, Bette Davis and the Rat Pack all bedazzle the walls.",
      "\"I love making movies,\" she said, pointing to one photo. \"And I feel like this is me a little bit. But it's not me, it's Sophia Loren! And with the crew there, and this is what my life is: it's me by a camera doing this every day!\"",
      "Lopez is a movie mainstay. She's made at least one film almost every year for the past three decades. Some were memorable, others weren't. Golden Globes and Oscars both eluded her. But this year just might be different, due to \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" an old-fashioned musical. \"I just thought to myself, This is what I've been waiting for my whole life,\" she said. \"I grew up on musicals. My mom loved musicals, and so I saw every musical you can think of. She was a fanatic!\"",
      "I asked, \"How many times do you think you saw 'West Side Story'?\"",
      "\"So many,\" she sighed. \"And it wasn't, 'Oh I've seen it about five times.' No! I've seen it hundreds of times! I feel like, so much!\"",
      "No surprise one of her idols is Rita Moreno, the other the late Chita Rivera, who starred in \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" on Broadway \u2013 the same Tony-winning shoes that Lopez is now trying to fill.",
      "Does she feel the weight of that? \"I kind of let it go and understood that I had to make it my own,\" she said.",
      "It came, though, at a tough time in her personal life \u2013 Ben Affleck, her now ex-husband, is one of the film's executive producers. \"It was a really tough time,\" she said. \"Every moment on set, every moment I was doing this role, I was so happy. And then, it was like, back home it was not great. And it was just like, Oh, you know, how do I reconcile this?\"",
      "Their divorce was settled the same month that \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" premiered at Sundance. \"It was the best thing that ever happened to me,\" she said. \"Because it changed me \u2026 It didn't change me, it helped me grow in a way that I needed to grow.\"",
      "The bright music of \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" is a purposeful contrast to the film's darker tale. It's an escape for two cellmates in an Argentinian prison: Molina, a queer window dresser; and Valentin, a proud Marxist revolutionary. Going to a movie in their mind helped ease their drudgery, and dissolve their differences.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" click on the video player below:",
      "Lopez said, \"It is a love letter, in a way, to the Latin community and to the queer community, this movie, because in a time like this \u2026 those communities are being demonized and marginalized.\"",
      "Inclusion and acceptance have always been themes in her music. Performing at the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show in Miami, one of her twins, Emme (whom she had with her third husband Marc Anthony), sang with her proudly about the challenges of identity \u2013 cultural and otherwise. \"Singing that with my child there, and them screaming that back to me \u2013 'cause I'm gonna live my life \u2013 that was one of the best moments in my life,\" said Lopez, who then apologized for getting emotional thinking back on that. \"I didn't know it would catch me like that. It was one of the best moments of my life. Being so joyful and happy and being exactly who they were.\"",
      "The kind of global platform that she has now was unimaginable back when, against her parents' wishes, she dropped out of college and ran from her home in the Bronx chasing the city lights of Manhattan.",
      "With no place to stay, she slept on a bench at the Phil Black Dance Studio on Broadway. \"I crashed there for a while,\" she said. \"You know, when you're young you can do stuff like that. You don't know what's gonna happen to you.\"",
      "\"It's not an inconvenience,\" I said.",
      "\"No! You're like, whatever. Great! I can sleep here. I'll sleep here!\"",
      "As a kid, seeing a live Broadway show was a rare privilege, but the experience stuck. \"I remember sitting in an audience, watching a live show one time,\" she said. \"And I was with a friend, and I said, 'When you see that, don't you want to be up there, doing that?' And they were like, 'No!' And I was like, 'Okay. Is it just me?'\"",
      "In-between her auditions, Lopez was selling programs for \"Phantom of the Opera\" out in front of the Majestic Theatre. \"I was, like, really using my best tactics,\" she said. \"Like, I swing it up in the air and, like, you know, kind of try to be charming and funny!\"",
      "It was a winding road that finally got Jennifer Lopez to her own musical. It might just be that going back in time to Old Hollywood \u00a0-- is what pushes her Hollywood career forward.",
      "\"The hard times are the lessons, and you have to understand that,\" she said. \"You have to understand that. And once you do, everything just becomes a little bit lighter. And you can really, really fly.\"",
      "\"Does it feel like you're flying now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes. It does. It does,\" she replied. \"And I still feel like I want to fly higher. I want to see more. I want to do more things.\"",

      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",

      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could rise by an average of 75% after the tax credits expire, according to KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",

      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months.

    "summary": "President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between Tylenol and autism has drawn pushback from medical experts.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout\" Thursday the Trump administration is not advising pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol under any circumstances \u2014 as President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between the painkiller and fever reducer and autism draws pushback from medical experts.",
      "Oz \u2014 a former surgeon and television personality who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an agency that is under the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 said that if a pregnant woman develops a high fever, a doctor will likely encourage her to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, because fevers can pose health risks. And\u00a0studies show acetaminophen is the safest medication to treat fevers in pregnant women.",
      "\"The concern here is that I believe most women get low-grade fevers, they stub their toe, they have little aches and pains, and they think it's perfectly safe to throw a couple paracetamol or acetaminophen or Tylenol when they're pregnant, and I don't think that's the case,\" Oz said.",
      "On Monday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary released an open letter to physicians that said acetaminophen use during pregnancy \"may be associated with\" an increased risk of conditions like autism.",
      "The letter noted that \"while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established.\"",
      "Makary's letter was also more tempered than Mr. Trump's comments during a news conference earlier this week in which the president said there's \"no downside in not taking\" Tylenol.",
      "\"Acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics,\" Makary wrote in his letter.",
      "There is concern among the medical community that, as a result of the FDA's announcement Monday, that some patients could turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy.",
      "\"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication,\" Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News following the FDA's announcement. \"The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism.\"",
      "In a statement in response to the FDA's announcement, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said, \"Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" calling it \"the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "Oz also addressed Makary's announcement that the agency will approve the prescription drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid, to treat autism in children. Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"The key question is, if you, as a researcher on those trials, had a child, would you give that child leucovorin?\" Oz said he asked of researchers studying leucovorin. \"And when I asked the doctors on those trials, they said yes.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years,\u00a0according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is no scientific consensus as to why.",
      "Oz said that when he, Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, were asked by the White House to examine the issue, they found two \"clues,\" not conclusions, that pointed to leucovorin as a possible treatment option for autistic children, and acetaminophen as a medication pregnant women should be cautious about taking.",
      "\"These are things that we believe, that if you're fully transparent about, you'll rebuild trust with the American people,\" Oz said. \"Just tell people what you know.\"",
      "Oz argued that Mr. Trump was right in pushing for the FDA to both approve leucovorin and make its Tylenol recommendation \u2014 even though there is no consensus in the medical community and no definitive evidence supporting either move \u2014 because he believes the FDA has an obligation to be transparent.",
      "But Oz was clear that patients should consult their doctors first before making a decision.",
      "\"The Tylenol issue is whether or not we should warn moms, who are pregnant today, about a problem that we may not know fully the answer to \u2014 'Is Tylenol a problem during pregnancy?' \u2014 for another five years,\" Oz said. \"Well, what about the kid today? Are you going to take the Tylenol or not. Well I think the answer is, the best prudent answer, of course take it if a doctor says you need it. But don't take it on your own without thinking twice about it.\"",
      "Oz also indicated that he would not advise a pregnant family member to take Tylenol without talking to their physician first.",
      "\"We're guarded in saying we don't have all the answers,\" he said. \"But if it's my family, I'm not going to have my pregnant daughter take acetaminophen if she doesn't need to be on it without certainly talking to a doctor about it.\"",

      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced most favored nation cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "The president said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",

      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",

In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs.

    "summary": "\"The last thing we want to do is just keep raising prices on our guests,\" Gregory's Coffee founder Gregory Zamfotis said. That might be easier said than done.",
    "story": [
      "The first Gregory's Coffee opened in 2006 on Manhattan's Park Avenue. Nineteen years later, the family-owned business has expanded to over 54 locations around the U.S. as well as a roastery in Queens, New York, that handles coffee beans from Brazil, Rwanda, Nicaragua and other major global producers.",
      "For Gregory Zamfotis, founder of the New York City-based chain, the business is about more than just dollars and cents \u2014 it's also about recognizing the special place coffee has long had in American culture as a driver of social connections.",
      "\"Coffee is built into the fabric of our society,\" Zamfotis told CBS News. \"People come together over coffee. When it's a meeting or interview, or we just want to get some work done, coffee tends to be the centerpiece of those conversations.\"",
      "With many Americans still feeling the effects of elevated inflation, for many coffee drinkers one of those conversations is likely to center on the drink's soaring costs.",
      "Prices have leaped nearly 21% over the past 12 months, with the average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee recently reaching a record high of $8.87 per pound, up from $7.02 in January USDA data shows.",
      "Several factors are behind the spike in coffee prices, including droughts in Brazil and volatile weather in other regions where the bean is cultivated. More recently, heavy U.S. tariffs on coffee-producing countries \u2014 including a hefty 50% levy on Brazil \u2014 have also driven up prices.",
      "Though coffee is a staple of American daily life, the vast majority of the beans is imported. Much of that is sourced from Latin America, with Brazil alone accounting for 35%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. produces relatively little coffee compared to the rest of the world. Hawaii, the top-producing state, harvested 21 million pounds during the 2024\u201325 season, according to the USDA. Yet Americans consumed a whopping 3.3 billion pounds of coffee during the same period, the agency said.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up\"",
      "Jake Leonti, director of coffee at Gregory's Coffee, said it's also far pricier to grow and produce coffee in the U.S.",
      "\"It's exponentially [more] expensive because it's Americans farming,\" he said. \"Whereas we can get super high-quality coffee from different parts of the world at a price that's much more friendly to the consumer.\"",
      "Gregory's Coffee has not raised prices yet despite the jump in costs. But Leonti said that could change soon.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up \u2014 there's no other way around it,\" he said. \"We're seeing tariffs from the places where we get our bags printed as well. So everything around the coffee business is getting tariffs at some point.\"",
      "Like other retailers, Gregory's prices vary depending on where a store is located, reflecting regional labor and other costs. In New York City, the chain charges $3.45 for a regular cup of coffee, while at its New Jersey and Washington, D.C., outlets the same item runs $3.15.",
      "Other retailers are also preparing for increased coffee costs. Mark Smucker, CEO of The J.M. Smucker Co., whose portfolio includes the Folgers Coffee, Caf\u00e9 Bustelo and Dunkin' at-home brands, said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in June that prices will likely increase for a third time this year \"due to higher green coffee costs.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Catherine R. Smith said during the company's third-quarter earnings call in July that, due to the company's coffee buying and hedging practices, customers shouldn't expect price increases until the first half of fiscal 2026.",
      "At Gregory's Coffee, \"The last thing we want to do is just keep raising prices on our guests,\" Zamfotis said. \"We're hoping that if prices go up a few pennies across the board, that doesn't turn off our everyday customers.

      "Shopify said it wants to position its merchants at the forefront of a sea change in how online commerce is conducted.",
      "\"We're making sure our merchants thrive in the era of agentic commerce,\" said Lee. \"We're helping everyone from indie brands to household names reach shoppers in entirely new ways.\"",

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S.\u00a0government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies would be expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even if lawmakers fail this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "Barring a deal in Congress, a shutdown would begin at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",

If that occurs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) would suspend all operations, including data collection activities for BLS surveys, website updates and economic reports, the plan states.",

      "Although it's unclear whether a shutdown will occur or how long it could last, the possibility raises the risk that some government economic reports would not be available to the Fed before its next meeting on Oct. 29, he added.",
      "\"In our view, an increasingly data dependent Federal Reserve with limited visibility into the September data increases the probability of an October pause,\" meaning that the Fed could hold off on an additional rate cut at the Oct. 29 meeting, Reid\u00a0wrote.",

      "\"We believe that a shutdown will have only a small and transitory economic impact, but it may spur some financial market volatility, especially if delays in government economic reports obscure the path of Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts,\" said Jennifer Timmerman, investment strategy analyst, in a Wells Fargo Investment Institute\u00a0report\u00a0released Monday.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariffs-upholstered-furniture-kitchen-cabinets-bathroom-vanities/",
    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 13:17:33 -0400",
    "summary": "While the tariffs will impact everyone to some degree, experts say more of the pain will be felt by lower-income consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Fresh tariffs on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities recently announced by President Trump on social media\u00a0could cause already high prices to rise even further, and deter some Americans from embarking on home renovation projects.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday said his administration will levy a 50% tariff on all imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and \"associated products,\" plus a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture from abroad.",
      "Preventing what he called the \"flooding\" of such goods into the U.S. is a matter of national security, the president added. Both sets of tariffs will kick in Oct. 1, he said. \"It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Prices for living room, kitchen and dining room furniture \u2014 much of which is imported \u2014 rose 9.5% from August 2024 to August 2025,\u00a0the latest CPI data shows, driven by Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs, according to economists.\u00a0Furniture and bedding also rose 4.7% over the same period, and 2.8% for household furnishings and supplies.",
      "If the new levies go into effect, furniture makers will feel the hit, and some will likely pass the costs on to consumers, industry analysts told CBS News. The sectoral tariffs could also hinder business activity and growth, they added, as companies wait to see if tariff policies change and defer investment decisions.",
      "\"Higher prices are an inevitable consequence of these tariffs,\" Zak Stambor, a retail analyst at market research company eMarketer, told CBS News. \"People undergoing bathroom or kitchen renovations are in a tough spot right now because there was so little warning. The costs of those things will now be higher, and people might not have already bought them because they were waiting for permits.\"",
      "Low-income consumers will feel the squeeze the most, not just because they have less discretionary income but because lower-cost furniture sold in the U.S. tends to be imported from Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Malaysia and India.",
      "Some higher-end furniture is manufactured in the U.S., and therefore less exposed to tariffs, according to Telsey Advisory Group managing director and senior retail analyst Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez. She said retailers will have no choice but to raise prices on imported goods once the tariffs take effect.",
      "\"They are trying not to raise prices too much ahead of holiday season. But they can't absorb 30% tariffs on top of other tariffs that are already in place,\" she told CBS News. \"They'll have to pass through pricing, probably in the form of a double-digit price increase.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News's request for comment on analysts' claims the tariffs could drive up prices or inhibit business investment.",
      "Uncertainty persists",
      "From retailers' point of view, the levies could make investing in new inventory a riskier and more difficult proposition, according to Stambor, as costs and consumer demand could shift.",
      "\"Retailers' only certainty is that uncertainty is here to stay. What's true today very well may not be true tomorrow and that makes life incredibly challenging,\" he said.",
      "Naturepedic, an Ohio-based maker of organic mattresses and bedroom furniture, said it had been planning to launch an upholstered product line in late 2025 or early 2026, including headboards. However, as of Thursday, it is reconsidering that expansion.",
      "\"We are having to go back to the drawing board a little bit,\" Naturepedic Chief Growth Officer Arin Schultz told CBS News. \"We might drop it if it doesn't make sense, even though we're pretty far along in the process.\"",
      "Of the tariffs announced on Thursday, he said, \"If they could turn around and not do it, that would be great.\"",
      "Cost to consumers",
      "John Mercer, head of global research at Coresight Research, a provider of retail industry insights, doesn't expect all manufacturers to pass on all tariff-related costs to the consumer, and says some will likely take steps to mitigate the impact.",
      "Firms with larger inventories will be able to sell through what they have in stock before implementing any price hikes, while on-demand furniture makers may have to raise prices sooner, rather than later, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing.",
      "Mercer, however, doesn't expect the levies to compel makers of upholstered furniture and cabinetry to quickly move production to the U.S.",
      "\"Generally, that's not easy, and it's more expensive,\" he said. \"There is a reason why companies have offshored production, and that's because because it's traditionally much cheaper.\"",

      "About 58 million pounds of corn dogs and other sausage-on-a-stick products are being recalled across the U.S. because pieces of wood may be embedded in the batter, with several consumers reporting injuries to date.",
      "According to a Saturday notice published by the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, the recall covers select State Fair corn dogs and Jimmy Dean \"Pancakes & Sausage On a Stick\" and \"French Toast & Sausage On a Stick\" products from Texas-based Hillshire Brands, which is a subsidiary of Tyson Foods.",
      "The contamination problem was discovered after Hillshire received multiple consumer complaints, the service notes, five of which involved injuries. The company later determined that a \"limited number\" of these products included \"extraneous pieces of wooden stick within the batter,\" Tyson said in a corresponding announcement, adding that it opted to initiate a recall \"out of an abundance of caution.\"",
      "The recalled corn dogs and sausage-on-a-stick goods were produced between March 17 and as recently as Friday, per Saturday's recall notices. Tyson, which is headquartered in Arkansas, said the issue was isolated to one facility located in Haltom City, Texas.",
      "FSIS is worried that some of these recalled products may be in consumers' refrigerators and freezers in households across the U.S., as well as some schools and other institutions. In addition to being sold online and to retailers nationwide, the agency noted Saturday, these products were also sold to school districts and Defense Department facilities.",
      "Consumers in possession of the recalled items are urged to throw them away or return them to their place of purchase.",
      "To determine which corn dogs and other sausage goods are subject to this recall, consumers should check the product's name, use-by dates and other identifying information published online by the FSIS and Tyson. The products being recalled should also have an establishment number of \"EST-582\" or \"P-894\" printed on the packaging.",
      "It's unclear if consumers who purchased these now-recalled products will be eligible for a refund. The FSIS says consumers with questions about the recall can contact Christina Self, The Hillshire Brands Company Associate Director of Customer Care, at 888-747-7611.",
      "Foreign object contamination is one of the top reasons for food recalls in the U.S. Beyond plastic, metal fragments, bits of bugs and more \"extraneous\" materials have prompted recalls by making their way into packaged goods.",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 12:44:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Newspapers announced John D. Rockefeller as the first U.S. billionaire 109 years ago. Today there are more than 900 American billionaires.",
    "story": [
      "On Sept. 29, 1916, it was front page news that a surge in Standard Oil's stock price likely made oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller America's first billionaire.",
      "More than a century later, the United States is home to hundreds of billionaires whose fortunes increasingly come from technology and financial markets. Together, they control a growing share of the country's wealth \u2014 approaching the percentage held by Gilded Age industrialists who built monopolies in railroads, oil and steel.",
      "Here's what research tells us about America's billionaire class today.",
      "American billionaires number over 900, according to researchers",
      "There are a few different estimates of the number of American billionaires, but researchers tend to agree that the billionaire class exceeds 900 and is growing.",
      "Forbes, which has produced a list of billionaires since the 1980s, counted roughly 900 in early 2025 \u2014 up from 813 in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, the wealth-data firm Altrata pinned the number of U.S. billionaires at 1,135 in 2024, an uptick from 1,050 in 2023 and up more than 80% from levels in 2016, when they began releasing yearly reports.",
      "And JP Morgan Chase Private Bank estimated the number at roughly 1,990 in 2024 \u2014 about 15% more than its 2023 estimate.",
      "Part of the reason estimates vary is that the ultra-wealthy are not required or incentivized to disclose their net worth. The SEC requires investors to report ownership of more than 5% of a company's shares, but valuations fluctuate with the market, complicating wealth estimates.",
      "Adjusted for inflation, the number of billionaires with a Rockefeller-sized fortune is a much smaller set.",
      "His $1 billion in 1916 would be worth roughly $30 billion today. By that measure, only about 30 American billionaires have a similar fortune, according to Forbes and\u00a0Bloomberg. Among them are Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tesla founder Elon Musk, with net worths above $300 billion. Other tech titans also top the list, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 both with fortunes of over $200 billion each, as of Sept. 29.",
      "Christopher Nichols, a professor of history at Ohio State University said, \"The billionaires of the Gilded Age and the multimillionaires were involved in what we think of as blue chip industries, where there are lots of jobs and stuff produced. The billionaires of today's world are mostly working in tech sectors and places that very often don't employ many people.\"",
      "Billionaires have roughly $6.8 trillion in wealth in 2025",
      "Together, America's billionaires had an approximate total net worth of $6.8 trillion in the spring of 2025, Forbes estimates, which is a jump of more than a trillion compared to last year after a strong year of growth for U.S. stocks in 2024.",
      "In the 20th century, Scottish journalist B.C. Forbes, who founded the eponymous magazine, wrote that if Rockefeller's wealth \"could be turned into cash and distributed equally\u2014which it couldn't\u2014[it] would give every man, woman and child in the United States $10 each.\"",
      "Today, if that estimated $6.8 trillion held by U.S. billionaires could be turned into cash and divided equally among roughly 340 million Americans, it would amount to about $20,000 per person.",
      "Another way to think about that sum is that it could theoretically be used to buy every NFL team, pay off Americans' student loan and medical debt\u00a0and purchase 9 million homes at the current median sales price, with hundreds of billions left over.",
      "The ultra rich own an increasingly large share of the nation's wealth",
      "Data from the World Inequality Database shows that the share of wealth held by the top 1% and the ultra-rich top 0.001% has been rising for decades \u2014 toward the record levels observed in the Gilded Age.",
      "The share of the national wealth held by the top 1% peaked at nearly 50% in 1929 before tumbling during the Great Depression, according to the data.",
      "\"What happened with the Great Depression was that large fortunes were lost in the stock market. And then the New Deal rebuilt the economy around workers and around small businesses,\" said Jeremi Suri, a professor of history and public affairs at University of Texas.",
      "But in the early 1980s, the top 1% began regaining ground, as union jobs declined and traditional industries like manufacturing shrunk, according to Suri.",
      "By 2023 the top 1%, or those with over $4.6 million in assets, controlled more than a third of the nation's wealth \u2014 up over 10 percentage points from 1980.",
      "Data collected by the same researchers shows that the trendline looks similar for those in the top 0.001% of people in the country \u2014 or those who owned more than $1.5 billion in 2023.",
      "The hundreds of billionaires in this category owned about 1% of the nation's net wealth in 1980 and 5% in 2023.",
      "Most billionaires are males with self-made fortunes, but a significant number inherited their money",
      "Demographically, the billionaire class still resembles J.D. Rockefeller in many ways.",
      "The vast majority of the world's billionaires are men \u2014 about 86.5% in 2025, according to Forbes \u2014 and most make rather than inherit their wealth.",
      "Rockefeller himself was the son of a traveling salesman and a housewife. While his family helped him launch his career, Rockefeller built the majority of his fortune on his own, according to Nichols, an editor of \"A Companion to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.\"",
      "\"He came from enough middle class wealth that he could get a loan from his dad to start that business, which so often is the story for business folks,\" Nichols said. \"But he made his billions through his business acumen and hard work, and then also his ruthless competitiveness in an under-regulated time.\"",
      "Research suggests inheritance plays a significant role for many wealthy people today. Roughly 30% of the world's billionaires have inherited their fortunes, according to a 2024 report by UBS, a wealth management company in Sweden. And the share in the U.S. is about a third, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Altrata data.",
      "Some of America's wealthiest heirs include Walmart's Alice, Rob and Jim Walton, and Jacqueline Mars, who owns roughly one third of the candy giant Mars founded by her grandfather.",
      "Rockefeller and his son gave away a significant amount of their money to charity but it continues to live on. And descendants of the family share a fortune valued around $10.3 billion in 2024.",

    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",

Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

    "summary": "The economic impact of a government shutdown depends on its duration, economists say. Some payments, like Social Security, would continue to be issued.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown could begin on Wednesday, halting pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delaying services, as lawmakers remain deadlocked over funding past Sept. 30.",
      "The financial impact of a shutdown typically depends on the length of the disruption, with each week costing the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to a new analysis from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco. A suspension could also weigh on investor and consumer confidence at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing headwinds, he told CBS News.",
      "Government shutdowns aren't new: The U.S. has experienced 14 of them since 1980, with the longest occurring over 34 days from December 2018 into January 2019, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap. Federal agencies develop plans ahead of a shutdown to determine which employees will remain working.",
      "For instance, the Department of Health and Human Services posted its shutdown plan on Sept. 25, which states that more than 32,000 employees, or about 41% of the agency's workforce, will be furloughed. The other employees are either funded through sources other than annual appropriations or will continue to work, although without pay, because they are in essential roles.",
      "And while federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "Government shutdowns have typically been short, with the pay of military service persons often seen as a deadline for getting funding restored, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report. The next military pay date at risk from a shutdown would be Oct. 15, they noted.",
      "\"For civilian employees, the first pay date at risk would be Oct. 10 but this is less likely to drive a compromise,\" the analysts noted.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",
      "Would Social Security benefits be impacted?",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are covered by mandatory spending, which means that funding for these programs has been approved by Congress to continue without an expiration date.",
      "Social Security benefits would be paid on time, while health care payments for seniors in Medicare and low- and middle-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid would continue.",
      "However, Social Security's administrative budget needs to receive approval from Congress, which means that some of its services could be impacted in a shutdown, some experts note.",
      "\"In the event of a government shutdown ... customer service at the Social Security Administration may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing and replacing Medicare cards,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in a Friday email.",
      "Would other federal functions like the TSA be impacted?",
      "Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay because they provide essential services.",
      "Unlike other government agencies. the U.S. Postal Service operates as a self-funded, independent agency. That means mail, packages and other shipments would still be delivered and post offices would remain open in the event of a shutdown.",
      "But there could be other impacts for consumers and businesses. For one, some mortgage processing could face delays because the flood insurance program would be closed to new policies until Congress agrees to a new spending deal, according to TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.",
      "\"That means no mortgages which require federal flood insurance will be originated,\" he noted.",
      "In previous shutdowns, other services were also suspended, such as the Food and Drug Administration's inspections, as well as the entry to the National Parks, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 05:00:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Under a new law, many Americans will have to meet a work requirement to obtain and keep their Medicaid coverage. But due to an exemption, millions living in areas of high unemployment could be spared.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Medicaid enrollees may have a way out of the new federal work requirement \u2014 if they live in a county with high unemployment.",
      "By January 2027, President Trump's far-reaching domestic policy law will require many adult, nondisabled Medicaid enrollees in 42 states and Washington, D.C., to work or volunteer 80 hours a month or go to school.",
      "But under the law, Medicaid enrollees in counties where unemployment is at least 8% or 1.5 times the national unemployment rate could be shielded from the work requirement, if their state applies for an exemption.",
      "A new analysis by KFF shows that exemption in the GOP's work requirement could offer a reprieve to potentially millions of Americans caught in a tough spot \u2014 needing to work to secure health insurance but having trouble finding a job.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office projected the work requirement would apply to 18.5 million Medicaid enrollees, causing about 5.3 million to lose their government health coverage by 2034. CBO spokesperson Caitlin Emma confirmed to KFF Health News that analysts factored the unemployment rate exemption into their projections. Only states that expanded Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act or a special waiver must enact a work requirement, under the federal law.",
      "But how many people could be exempt depends on how the Trump administration interprets the law, in addition to whether their states' officials apply.",
      "For example, if Trump officials exempt people in counties where the unemployment rate has been above the law's thresholds for any month over a 12-month period, about 4.6 million Medicaid enrollees in 386 counties could qualify for an exemption today based on the latest unemployment data, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "That amounts to just under a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees subject to the work requirement.",
      "Under that one-month threshold, \"the impact could be fairly significant,\" said Jennifer Tolbert, a co-author of the analysis and the deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.",
      "But, she said, the Trump administration is more likely to adopt a stricter threshold based on average unemployment over a 12-month period. That would align with work requirements under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the food assistance commonly known as food stamps.",
      "Only about 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees living in 158 counties could be exempted under that standard, or about 7% of the total subject to work requirements, KFF found. That's about 7% of enrollees who live in expansion states who would otherwise need to meet the new requirement.",
      "Based on the 12-month criteria, about 90% of Medicaid enrollees who could be exempted based on high unemployment reside in five states, according to KFF: California, New York, Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio. California alone accounts for over half of those who could be exempted.",
      "The unemployment rate exemption is one of several carve-outs from the Medicaid work requirement in the GOP's law. The law also exempts parents with children under 14, people who are disabled or frail, and those who are pregnant, incarcerated, or in a substance use disorder program, among others. The high unemployment provision is different than most because it exempts people living in entire counties.",
      "Two top Republicans key to the bill's passage \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson and Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "To qualify for the Medicaid exemption, states would have to apply to the federal government on behalf of individuals in eligible counties. And if a county earned an exemption, the government would determine how long it applies.",
      "Even if the federal government grants exemptions broadly, health advocates fear some Republican-led states could balk at applying for exemptions in order to keep enrollment down, as they say has been the case with SNAP exemptions. As of 2023, 18 states did not have an exemption under the SNAP program, even though some of their residents might be eligible.",
      "\"It's not a guarantee that people can rely on,\" said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group that intends to push for the broadest possible exemptions to help people maintain their coverage. Eastern Kentucky has several counties with perennially high unemployment.",
      "In advocating for Mr. Trump's bill, many Republicans in Washington argued that most people who gained Medicaid benefits under the Affordable Care Act should be working to get off of government assistance.",
      "But as Georgia's and Arkansas' experiences have shown, Medicaid work requirements can be costly for states to run and frustrating for enrollees to navigate. About 18,000 people in Arkansas, or nearly a quarter of the state's adults who gained Medicaid coverage through the ACA expansion, lost coverage when the state had a work requirement in 2018 and 2019. A court ended the state's work requirement program.",
      "Critics point out that most Medicaid enrollees already work or have a disability or caregiving responsibilities, and they argue the reporting requirements merely serve as a bureaucratic hurdle to obtaining and keeping coverage. Under the GOP law, enrollees' work status needs to be verified at least twice a year.",
      "Most of the coverage losses due to work requirements occur among people who work or should qualify for an exemption but nevertheless lose coverage due to red tape, research shows.",
      "Not every state must implement a work requirement under Mr. Trump's law, only those that chose to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income people through the ACA or a federal waiver. The ACA has provided hundreds of billions in federal dollars to help states cover everyone making up to 138% of the federal poverty level \u2014 $21,597 for an individual in 2025.",
      "Forty states and Washington, D.C., took up the expansion. Georgia and Wisconsin partly expanded their Medicaid eligibility by getting a federal waiver, adding them to the list of states subject to the work requirement. These two states were not included in the KFF analysis because of a lack of county-level enrollment data.",
      "Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said she is pleased the law makes some exceptions for places where jobs are scarce. It could limit how many people lose coverage because of the work requirement, she said.",
      "Wagner said SNAP's unemployment rate exemption has helped millions of people avoid losing their food assistance, but its impact also depends on whether a state seeks the waiver.",
      "She is concerned the Trump administration may make it difficult for counties to get exempted under the Medicaid law.",
      "\"I'm glad it's in there as it will certainly help people, but it's still a terrible bill,\" she said. \"This will not really blunt the harm of the bill.\"",

      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is warning consumers not to eat certain ready-to-eat pasta meals sold at Walmart and Trader Joe's stores because they may be contaminated with listeria bacteria previously linked to a deadly outbreak tied to pre-made chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals.",
      "In an announcement Thursday, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued a public health alert for Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce sold at Walmart in refrigerated 12-ounce clear plastic trays. The products have best-by dates of Sept. 22 through Oct. 1 and may still be in consumers' refrigerators.",
      "In an update on Friday, the FSIS added to its public health alert some meals sold at Trader Joe's, the Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo, sold in 16-ounce plastic tray packages with \"best if used by\" dates of Sept. 20, Sept. 24 or Sept. 27. The products contain the establishment number \"P- 45288\" inside the USDA mark of inspection. The stores possibly affected are in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah, Trader Joe's said Friday.",
      "The affected meals from Walmart contain the establishment numbers \"EST. 50784\" and \"EST. 47718\" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the label. They were sent to Walmart stores nationwide.",
      "\"The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority. We have removed this product from our impacted stores and we are working with the supplier to investigate,\" a Walmart spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News on Friday.",
      "There have been no reported illness complaints for the product in question and consumers should discard the meals if they have them and can receive a full refund at any Walmart store. Trader Joe's told customers to discard the product or return it to their local store for a full refund.",
      "\"We are issuing this guidance in an abundance of caution because testing of another brand with a shared ingredient source indicated this product may have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes,\" Trader Joe's said on its website. \"There have been no positive Listeria tests for the Trader Joe's product itself, and there have been no reports of illness associated with these production codes.\"",
      "No recall has been issued, but FreshRealm, a large food producer that distributed the products, said they advised Walmart this week to pull the meals from store shelves. Additional products may be identified, according to the FSIS.",
      "The meals may be contaminated with the same strain of listeria that caused an outbreak tied to chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals sold at Walmart and Kroger stores.\u00a0Four people were killed and at least 20 were sickened in the outbreak, which federal health officials updated on Friday evening. The outbreak led to a large recall this summer.",
      "\"FreshRealm held beef meatball marinara linguine meals after they tested positive for the outbreak strain,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0said in its update Friday. \"Pasta that went into the beef meatball marinara linguine meals has tested positive for Listeria, but additional information is pending to determine if the samples taken from the pre-cooked pasta is the same strain making people sick. Do not eat affected foods, return them or throw them out.\"",
      "FreshRealm conducted tests that detected the listeria in linguine used in the meatball dish, company officials said. The strain matched the listeria identified in the chicken fettuccine Alfredo outbreak, the company said.",
      "\"We have long maintained that the source of the listeria was likely an ingredient supplied by a third party,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The pasta came from Nate's Fine Foods of Roseville, California. The company did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press.",

Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, tiredness, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions, according to the CDC.",

    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 20:29:37 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture and a 25% tariff on heavy trucks.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would impose a new round of tariffs, including a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30% tariff on heavy trucks.",
      "In social media posts to Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the new tariffs would take effect Oct. 1.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his posts that the 100% tariff on \"any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product\" would not apply to companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., which he defined as either \"breaking ground\" or being \"under construction.\"",
      "In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shockwaves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.",
      "Still, some experts think the new pharma tariffs could end up having only a modest impact, noting that generic drugs are exempt. The loophole for drugmakers with operations in the U.S. is also likely to soften the blow, Neal Shearing, group chief economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"Many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies either already have some production in the U.S. or have announced plans to build production in the near future,\" he said. \"Add in the fact that pharmaceuticals is the one area where we think there may have been significant inventory accumulation this year, as importers have sought to front-run potential tariffs, and the impact on the effective tariff rate is likely to be small.\"",
      "Higher costs for home furnishings?",
      "Trump argued that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were \"flooding\" the U.S. with their products and that tariffs must be applied \"for National Security and other reasons.\"",
      "The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump announced on social media that a \"major Tariff Investigation\" was being conducted on furniture coming into the U.S. and said that within the next 50 days, the investigation would be completed, and a tariff rate would be announced.",
      "The president said the 25% tariff on \"all 'Heavy (Big!) Trucks' made in other parts of the world\" was \"in order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition.\"",
      "\"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,\" Trump posted.",
      "Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration's broad tariffs defied predictions that they would fuel inflation, but that respite seems to have ended after economic data this month showed the duties are now driving prices upward. The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Mr. Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.",
      "Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.",
      "\"There's no inflation,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday. \"We're having unbelievable success.\"",

      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of the Miami-based Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million.",

In 2023, Unicomer Group acquired RadioShack, and in 2024, relaunched it as an e-commerce platform. RadioShack's current owners are not named in the lawsuit.",
      "Modell's Sporting Goods filed for bankruptcy in March 2020, when it also announced it would be closing all of its stores. REV bought the Modell's brand name and assets in August 2020. Pier 1 Imports \u2014 which still exists as an online store \u2014 declared bankruptcy in early 2020. REV acquired its trademark name and assets later that same year.",
      "The SEC's suit alleges that between 2020 and 2022, Mehr and Lopez, \"made material misrepresentations\" to hundreds of investors about the bankrupt retailers they had acquired. For example, to entice individuals to invest in their acquisitions, they said their portfolio companies were \"on fire\" and that \"cash flow is strong.\" They also told prospective backers that money raised for a company would only be invested in that specific firm.

    "summary": "The Social Security Administration is transitioning to electronic payments next week after 85 years of issuing paper checks to U.S. retirees.",
    "story": [
      "After 85 years of sending out paper checks to retirees, the Social Security Administration (SSA) is transitioning to electronic payments in what it says is an effort to modernize its services and improve efficiency.",
      "Starting Sept. 30, the SSA will no longer issue paper checks to its nearly 70 million recipients, instead sending benefits through either direct deposit or a prepaid debit card.",
      "\"We have been communicating directly with beneficiaries since July 1, and we have worked diligently to ensure that the less than one percent of individuals who receive paper checks have ample time to enroll in direct deposit or receive Direct Express cards,\" a Social Security spokesperson told CBS News in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"By moving to electronic payments exclusively, we aim to improve efficiency, security, and ensure beneficiaries receive their monthly benefits promptly,\" they added.",
      "The Social Security Administration has emphasized that electronic payments provide a safer and more secure way to receive benefits compared with paper checks, which the agency says are 16 times more likely to be lost or stolen. Eliminating paper checks is also a cost-saving measure: Checks cost 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer.",
      "In an online post, the SSA said it was sending notices to people who receive paper checks to alert them of the change. The agency encouraged paper check recipients to switch to the new payment options before the deadline to ensure they receive their benefits in a timely fashion.",
      "The Social Security spokesperson declined to comment on how people were contacted or on the current status of its outreach.",
      "Exceptions for some paper checks",
      "While the agency is pulling away from paper checks, there are some exceptions. The spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that the agency will continue to issue paper checks to people who have no other way to receive payments, echoing what it\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0in July after it announced the move to electronic payments.",
      "\"The U.S. Department of the Treasury will grant exceptions to the rule for qualifying circumstances,\" the spokesperson said, without elaborating on what the qualifying circumstances are or the steps Social Security recipients would need to take to establish they qualify.",
      "President Trump set the shift away from paper checks in motion with a March executive order that mandated all federal payments be digitized. Paper-based checks, the White House said at the time, impose \"unnecessary costs; delays; and risks of fraud, lost payments, theft, and inefficiencies.\"",
      "Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, as well as advocates for seniors have noted that the roughly 600,000 people who rely on the SSA's original payment system often need paper checks because they're unable to receive electronic deposits.",
      "That includes people who are \"unbanked,\" or those who lack access to traditional bank accounts. According to an August report from Bankrate, the unbanked represent 4.6% of the U.S. population, and tend to rely more on check-cashing services and other alternative forms of payment to manage their finances.",
      "While the Social Security Act was signed into law in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it wasn't until\u00a01940\u00a0that the agency began sending paper checks to retired workers and their dependents as well as to survivors of deceased insured workers. The first recipient of the monthly benefit was a woman named Ida M. Fuller.",
      "A Vermont native, Fuller worked as a teacher before becoming a legal secretary. After filing her retirement claim in 1939, she stopped by the Social Security office in Rutland, Vermont, the town where she once attended school, to inquire about her benefits. She had paid into the relatively new program for about three years, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"It wasn't that I expected anything, mind you, but I knew I'd been paying for something called Social Security and I wanted to ask the people in Rutland about it,\" she said.",
      "Fuller's first monthly check, issued on January 31, 1940, was for $22.54.",

    "summary": "Retailers are expected to hire fewer seasonal workers this year as tariffs and inflationary pressures roil the economy.",
    "story": [
      "Retailers around the U.S. are expected to sharply reduce the number of workers they add for the holidays, a shift from their usual seasonal hiring sprees to help cope with the annual crush of customers.",
      "Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas attributes the weak demand for extra workers this year to companies bearing the heavier costs from U.S. tariffs on foreign goods, as well as on rising inflation and their growing reliance on technology to improve efficiency.",
      "The firm expects retail hiring fo the holidays to fall to its lowest level since 2009, when the economy was emerging from a recession caused by the global financial crisis.",
      "\"Seasonal employers are facing a confluence of factors this year: tariffs loom, inflationary pressures linger, and many companies continue to rely on automation and permanent staff instead of large waves of seasonal hires,\" Andy Challenger, workplace expert and senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "The weaker seasonal hiring forecast comes as the U.S. job market is faltering. Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, falling far short of economists' expectations.",
      "Inflation has also edged up in recent months. The Consumer Price Index, which in March had sunk to an annual rate of 2.3%, in August\u00a0rose at a 2.9%\u00a0pace from a year ago.",
      "In the last quarter of 2024, retailers added just over 543,000 seasonal workers, down roughly 4% compared to 2023. Companies are projected to add fewer than 500,000 jobs during the last three months of 2025, according to Challenger. Such a figure would mark the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years.",
      "Challenger pointed to fewer seasonal hiring announcements than usual from retailers as a sign they plan to hire fewer workers for the holidays.",
      "\"While we could see a late hiring push if holiday sales surprise to the upside, the cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge. This year may be more about doing more with less,\" Challenger said.",
      "Tariffs are causing some consumers to pull back on spending, recent data shows. An August survey\u00a0of consumers from the University of Michigan found that most U.S. adults plan to spend less on goods that see tariff-driven price hikes. Just 24% of consumers surveyed said they expected to spend as usual on items that rise substantially in price, according to the report.",
      "Tariffs have already driven up the cost of some categories of goods for U.S. consumers. For example, in August, audio equipment rose in price by 12% compared to one year earlier,\u00a0 while the cost of household goods rose 10%, the latest Consumer Price Index report\u00a0shows.",
      "\"A wave of uncertainty is impacting not just retailers, but also consumers heading into the final quarter of the year. With hiring slowing across the board, Retailers may hire fewer workers themselves, while many of their shoppers slow spending,\" Challenger added.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/h-1b-visa-new-fee-immigration-impact-american-workers/",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:23:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The large fee could help some U.S. workers find jobs, but there could be longer-term costs, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says the new $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will spur companies to hire Americans instead of bringing in labor from overseas. Yet many economists predict the results will be more mixed, potentially fostering increased domestic hiring in some industries but slowing long-term economic growth with a knock-on effect on overall employment.",
      "\"I could envision a scenario in which otherwise available [American] employees see a large increase for their labor demand,\" Kirk Doran, associate professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame, said of the new visa policy. \"There is some evidence that for the kind of work H-1B employees do, there are available workers looking for jobs right now.\"",
      "In the near term, some technology industry workers in particular could see job gains as more companies seek to avoid the sharply higher costs of bringing in employees from overseas, Rutgers University labor economist Jennifer Hunt told CBS News.",
      "\"The winners would be U.S. native-born computer programmers,\" she said. \"If you're a native worker who is really similar to an immigrant, immigrants are usually bad for you. So we would expect current American, U.S. programmers to be helped.\"",
      "Yet the bigger picture is more complex. Other economic research shows that hiring immigrant workers often benefits companies, providing a ready source of skilled labor with the education and training that may not be widely available in the U.S.",
      "One 2024 study from the nonprofit IZA Institute of Labor Economics on the impact of U.S. immigration on employment said H-1B workers can \"help firms increase their employment, revenues and survival probabilities,\" while finding no evidence that hiring of foreign labor through the program displaced native-born American workers.",
      "The research \u2014 from economists at IZA, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, University of Delaware, University of Michigan and Queens College, CUNY \u2014 also found that every H-1B worker a company hired helped produce additional job gains. \"High-wage, high-productivity firms expand more and even crowd-in natives with college degrees\" when able to add H-1B workers, they wrote.",
      "George Mason University economics professor Michael Clemens underlined that H-1B workers with specialized skills can help boost a company's revenue and profits, potentially spawning other kinds of jobs at the employer, such as in sales and marketing, that can be filled by U.S. workers.",
      "As a result, Clemens worries that the policy change would hurt Americans' job prospects over the long term. \"It is going to choke off job opportunities for the people it is supposed to help,\" he said.",
      "Cost of restricting immigration",
      "To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company. Congress caps the number of H-1B visas \u2014 which are valid for three years and which can be extended for an additional three years \u2014 at 85,000 annually. Roughly 700,000 workers in the U.S. hold H-1B visas, according to Capital Economics.",
      "\"The costs of restricting immigration are widespread,\" Gaurav Khanna, a University of California San Diego professor of economics focusing on migration, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"On net, it benefits U.S. workers more than it hurts them, such that the benefits outweigh the costs. The visas allow the IT companies to grow quite rapidly, and these IT firms start hiring other workers in management positions and in HR, so it leads to employment growth at these firms.\"",
      "The White House dismissed the notion that hiring workers from abroad also benefits U.S. workers.",
      "\"President Trump continues to prove to so-called 'experts' wrong time and time again \u2013 no 'economic study' can change the reality lived by many Americans across the country who bore the brunt of the massive abuse of the H-1B system,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "Rogers added that the visa fee protects \"Americans from cheap, foreign labor.\"",
      "In a\u00a0proclamation\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump said H-1B visas disadvantage Americans by allowing companies to exploit the program to \"replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.\" That has stunted job opportunities and undermined wages, he added.",
      "How much do H-1B workers earn?",
      "Some research supports this claim. For example, an August analysis\u00a0from The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, found that H-1B workers earn significantly less than their American counterparts.",
      "\"[M]any employers may be using the H-1B program not to attract top-tier global talent, but to fill roles at below-median wage levels\u2014raising questions about the program's alignment with its stated objectives,\" the report said.",
      "Other changes could be coming to the H-1B program, with the Trump administration aiming to tilt it toward better-paid foreign workers. On Monday, it proposed replacing the lottery with a system that would favor immigrants with advanced skills and higher incomes.",
      "The Heritage report also notes that the visas restrict worker mobility by tying a visa holder to a given company, preventing them from seeking other employment. That can make such workers more desirable to employers than native workers, who can leave their jobs at any time, the report explains.",
      "In this sense, companies' reliance on the program can hurt native workers, the group said.",
      "\"But this creates an uneven playing field: Native workers, who are free to switch jobs or negotiate better pay, may be overlooked not because they lack skills, but because they are not as easily retained or controlled,\" wrote Alexander Frei, the report's author and formerly a senior research associate at Heritage. \"As a result, employers may favor visa-bound workers who accept lower wages and fewer demands, driving down bargaining power and wage growth for equally or more qualified U.S. workers.\"",
      "Other groups have\u00a0criticized the H-1B program for disproportionately benefiting large, multinational firms that can enter thousands of visa applicants in the lottery and hire whomever is successful.",

      "U.S. District Judge Melissa Damian ruled Friday that the consumers who filed the class-action lawsuit failed to show that the lack of confectionary details on the chocolate and peanut butter candies, such as missing mouths and eyes on jack-'o-lanterns, ghosts and other Halloween-themed figures, had cause them economic harm.",
      "Damian pointed out that while the consumers may have been disappointed by the chocolates' unwrapped appearances, the candies were not \"so flawed as to render them worthless.\" In other words, the chocolate still tasted like chocolate, even if they weren't as haunting as the purchasers had expected from the packaging.",
      "The lawsuit focused on several Hershey candies that are marketed around Halloween, including its Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins and its Reese's White Ghost, as well as a few other holiday-themed chocolates like its Reese's Peanut Butter Shapes Assortment Snowmen Stockings Bells.",
      "The original lawsuit, filed in 2024, claimed that Hershey used deceptive advertising because the \"artistic designs\" depicted on the wrappers were absent from the actual candies.",
      "But the difference between the wrappers and the chocolates' actual appearances wasn't enough to prove \"a concrete economic injury,\" Damian wrote on Friday.",
      "\"Plaintiffs' conclusory allegations as to why they have allegedly been deprived of the benefit of their bargain all boil down to their subjective, personal expectations of how the products would or should have looked when unpackaged,\" the judge added.",
      "Anthony Russo, an attorney for the consumers who sued Hershey, said that they intend to amend the complaint.",
      "\"The court is merely saying that the plaintiffs did not expressly allege in the complaint that the products were worthless to them or that they paid a price premium and allowed plaintiffs to amend the complaint, which they will be doing,\" Russo told CBS News.",

      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced most favored nation cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "The president said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",

      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs.

      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C., said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans.

      "The announcement also comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could rise by an average of 75% after the tax credits expire, according to KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government could shut down on Wednesday if Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even if a U.S.\u00a0government shutdown begins on Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress, with lawmakers currently at loggerheads over funding the federal government past Sept. 30.",
      "If an agreement isn't reached before then, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for their operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress appears to be barreling toward another government shutdown, with President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward for averting a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump said Sunday that a shutdown is likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, year-long spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

    "summary": "Much of the federal government is on the verge of shutting down\u200b if Congress does not reach a deal to approve new funding by Oct. 1. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government is on the verge of shutting down if Congress does not reach a deal to approve new funding by Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025.",
      "Republicans have proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides are dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during a government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 09:10:58 -0400",
    "summary": "The possibility of a shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs if Congress remains at an impasse over government funding, with a shutdown set to begin Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill has stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes are needed to advance it. Democrats want an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans have opposed. Without a resolution, the government will begin to shut down on Wednesday.",
      "If funding lapses, federal employees in critical positions would be required to stay on the job. Many others would be forced to stay home. Both groups would have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown threat means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid if there's a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck even if they haven't reached a deal to fund the government.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" This means they must get paid whether or not other parts of the government are funded.",
      "Pursuant to that section, members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election. Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

Only 15% of the costs had been reimbursed by Jan. 6 defendants as of summer 2024, according to a review by CBS News. But hours after returning to office, President Trump pardoned everybody convicted as part of the riot.",
      "In a letter dated Monday and obtained by CBS News, the top Democrats on the Senate Rules and Senate Judiciary committees asked the Justice Department to oppose efforts to seek repayments by those convicted in the Jan. 6, 2021, riots.",
      "\"These criminals are apparently demanding taxpayer compensation, not only to refund court-ordered restitution to cover damages they caused to the Capitol Building, but also to compensate them for having to face legal consequences for their actions,\" the letter reads.",
      "A CBS News review of court filings by some of the more than 1,500 pardoned Capitol riot defendants shows a growing number of formal requests to have federal courts order reimbursements.",
      "In a request submitted to a D.C. federal judge on Monday, riot defendant Richard Barnett cited Mr. Trump's pardon and Barnett's appeal of his conviction as part of a justification for the reimbursement of $2,455 in restitution and court assessment payments. Barnett's argument, in part, cited prior cases of pardon defendants.",
      "It said the Justice Department's decision in February to vacate his case \"wipes the slate clean, and restores to the defendant both the presumption of innocence and the right to be paid money based on a now vacated conviction.\"",
      "Barnett was found guilty by a Washington, D.C., grand jury in 2023, after prosecutors successfully argued he was on the front lines of the mob and was photographed with his feet on a desk in the office of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat.",
      "Last month, U.S. District Judge John Bates ordered the reimbursement of restitution payments to Jan. 6 defendant Yvonne St. Cyr, who was found guilty of obstructing law enforcement and other offenses as part of the Capitol riot.",
      "Bates directed the U.S. Treasury to pay the defendant back $2,270. The judge noted that St. Cyr was in the process of appealing her case when Mr. Trump returned to office, and an appellate court moved to vacate her conviction because she received a pardon from the president, so in \"the eyes of the law, no conviction ever existed.\"",
      "Bates' 15-page order opened, \"Sometimes a judge is called upon to do what the law requires, even if it may seem at odds with what justice or one's initial instincts might warrant. This is one such occasion.\"",
      "According to court filings reviewed by CBS News, the Justice Department supported St. Cyr's request for repayment. A filing submitted by U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro in August said the conviction \"was 'invalidated' when the D.C. Circuit vacated it.\"",
      "But in a separate case, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss denied a refund request by convicted Capitol riot participant Hector Vargas Santos. The Justice Department had supported his request.",
      "The Democratic senators' letter to the Justice Department, led by Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who is the vice chair of the Senate Rules Committee, said the efforts for repayments are part of a broader effort to rewrite the history of the Capitol insurrection.

      "It represents an additional front in a growing legal battle between liberal and conservative states over prescribing abortion medications via telehealth and mailing them to patients.",
      "Pills are the most common way abortions are accessed in the U.S. and are a major reason that, despite the bans, abortion numbers rose last year, according to a report.",
      "Louisiana said in a court case filed Sept. 19 that it had issued a warrant for a California-based doctor who it says provided pills to a Louisiana woman in 2023.",
      "Both the woman, Rosalie Markezich, and the state's attorney general are seeking to be part of a lawsuit that seeks to order drug regulators to bar telehealth prescriptions to mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions.",
      "In court filings, Markezich says her boyfriend at the time used her email address to order drugs from Dr. Remy Coeytaux, a California physician, and sent her $150, which she forwarded to Coeytaux. She said she had no other contact with the doctor.",
      "She said she did not want to take the pills but felt forced to and said in the filing that \"the trauma of my chemical abortion still haunts me\" and that it would not have happened if telehealth prescriptions to the drug were off limits.",
      "The accusation builds on a position taken by anti-abortion groups: that allowing abortion pills to be prescribed by phone or video call and filled by mail opens the door to women being coerced into taking them.",
      "\"Rosalie is bravely representing many woman who are victimized by the illegal, immoral, and unethical conduct of these drug dealers,\" Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement.",
      "Murrill's office didn't immediately answer questions about what charges Coeytaux faces or when the warrant was issued. But under the state's ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, physicians convicted of providing abortions face up to 15 years in prison and $200,000 in fines.",
      "Coeytaux is also the target of a lawsuit filed in July in federal court by a Texas man who says the doctor illegally provided his girlfriend with abortion pills.",

New York authorities are refusing to extradite Carpenter to Louisiana or to enforce Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton the $100,000 civil judgment against her.",
      "In the Louisiana case, officials said a pregnant minor's mother requested the abortion medication online and directed her daughter to take them. The mother was arrested, pleaded not guilty and was released on bond.",

      "Murrill told The Associated Press she will sue governors whose shield laws \"purport to protect these individuals from criminal conduct\" in Louisiana.",
      "The legal filings that revealed the Louisiana charge against Coeytaux are part of an effort for Louisiana, along with Florida and Texas, to join a lawsuit filed last year by the Republican attorneys general for Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to roll back federal approvals for mifepristone.",
      "This year, both Louisiana and Texas have adopted laws to target out-of-state providers of abortion pills.",

      "Asked whether the review could lead to a ban on mifepristone, CBS News medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder suggested it would be difficult for the FDA to withdraw approval, an extraordinary step that would quickly draw legal challenges. But she said depending on what the safety review finds, it could make access more difficult by limiting the drug's availability through telehealth or by mail or by restricting the ability to prescribe it to doctors, rather than physician assistants or nurses who are also currently permitted to prescribe it.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 00:10:58 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump floated a framework to end the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted \u2014 though it's unclear how Hamas will respond.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump offered up a 20-point plan Monday that he cast as a roadmap to end the Israel-Hamas war, a proposal that was backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 though it remains unclear how Hamas will respond.",
      "The plan \u2014 which was presented as Netanyahu visited the White House \u2014 calls for Hamas to return all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and for Israel's military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases. It proposes handing over parts of Gaza to a \"technocratic\" committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu that his goal is to ensure a \"sustainable, long-term peace.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",
      "Netanyahu said Monday he supports the plan, which \"achieves our war aims.\" He said if Hamas does not accept the offer, \"Israel will finish the job by itself.\"",
      "Hamas has not yet responded to the proposal. Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief met with negotiators from Hamas, who said they would review the proposal \"in good faith\" and provide a response, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "Some unanswered questions about the plan still linger, including the exact timing of possible Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and the involvement of different international partners.",
      "Israel and Hamas would stop fighting, trade hostages and prisoners",
      "The plan calls for an immediate end to fighting if both Israel and Hamas agree to the plan, with Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip immediately withdrawing to an \"agreed upon line.\"",
      "\"During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal,\" the plan states.",
      "Within 72 hours of Israel accepting the deal, which Netanyahu appeared to do Monday, Hamas is expected to free all remaining hostages. Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.",
      "In exchange, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, as well as 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the current conflict. The plan calls for the remains of 15 deceased Gazans to be returned for every one deceased hostage. The Israeli releases would take place after the hostages are released by Hamas.",
      "The plan calls for Gaza to be demilitarized \"under the supervision of independent monitors,\" with any weapons factories and tunnels destroyed and weapons decommissioned.",
      "\"A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people,\" one of the 20 points states.",
      "Aid and economic development would enter Gaza",
      "The plan states \"full aid will be immediately sent\" to Gaza, which has faced severe food shortages and has fallen into famine in some regions, according to the world's leading authority on food crises.",
      "It calls for aid deliveries that are at least equal to the levels agreed upon during a prior two-month ceasefire that began in January, with supplies flowing through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza. It also states the plan would involve \"rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries.\"",
      "It states aid would be distributed by \"international institutions not associated in any manner with either party,\" including the United Nations and the Red Crescent. The plan does not mention the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial U.S.- and Israeli-backed group that has handled many aid deliveries in the territory in recent months, whose members have been repeatedly accused of firing at Palestinians trying to get aid.",
      "The proposal also floats convening a \"panel of experts\" that could draw up economic redevelopment plans for the Gaza Strip. It states Gaza would exist in a \"special economic zone\" with \"preferred tariff and access rates.\"",
      "Gaza to be led by \"technocratic\" group and stabilization force, not Hamas",
      "After Israel withdraws from parts of Gaza, the plan calls for the territory to be governed by neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority, which currently oversees much of the West Bank.",
      "Instead, the enclave would be governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.\" It's not clear who would participate in that committee, but the plan states it would be composed of \"qualified Palestinians and international experts.\"",
      "Overseeing this new governing structure would be a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a press conference Monday, the president said he's slated to lead the board \"not at my request, believe me. I'm very busy. But we have to make sure this works.\"",
      "The plan also envisions an \"International Stabilization Force\" that would temporarily oversee security in Gaza. This group would be backed by the U.S. and Arab states, and tasked with training \"vetted Palestinian Police forces\" in collaboration with Jordan and Egypt.",
      "It states Hamas would need to \"agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form.\" But Hamas members would get amnesty if they \"commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons,\" and members of the group who want to leave the territory would be able to do so.",
      "The plan would also \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 sideline the Palestinian Authority, which has played a key part in security and governance in the occupied Palestinian territories since the 1990s. The authority is dominated by Fatah, a political movement that has long been at odds with Hamas, and it has not governed Gaza since Hamas took over the strip in 2007.",
      "Netanyahu has long criticized the Palestinian Authority. He said Monday the group would have \"no role whatsoever in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation,\" including changes to its education system and an end to a long-controversial stipend system for the families of Palestinian militants.",
      "The West Bank \u2014 which Israel has occupied since 1967 \u2014 is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. The Gaza Strip was also occupied in 1967, though Israel withdrew from the territory and removed its settlements in 2005. The territory has been under a tight Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas' 2007 takeover.",
      "Israel would withdraw from Gaza and won't annex territory",
      "The Israel Defense Forces would immediately withdraw from part of Gaza after a deal is reached. It would continue to withdraw from parts of the territory and hand over control to the new International Stabilization Force \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.\"",
      "Israeli forces would remain present in a \"security perimeter,\" however, until Gaza \"is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat,\" the plan states. Netanyahu said Monday the IDF would remain in that perimeter \"for the foreseeable future.\"",
      "If Hamas doesn't accept the proposal, it calls for the plan to \"proceed in the terror-free areas\" that are handed over from the Israeli military to the new stabilization force.",
      "Plan calls statehood an \"aspiration of the Palestinian people\"",
      "The proposal does not lay out a clear roadmap for an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But it says that, if the plan works out, \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, and has castigated U.S. allies like the United Kingdom and France for recognizing a Palestinian state last week at the United Nations General Assembly, calling it an \"absurd prize for terrorism.\" Mr. Trump has also opposed calls for a Palestinian state. But key Arab partners have backed Palestinian statehood and cast it as a necessary component of any long-term resolution.",
      "The plan also pushes for an \"interfaith dialogue process\" to \"try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis,\" and a \"dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence.\"",

      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., ruled that the U.S. Agency for Global Media cannot implement a reduction in force eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees on Tuesday. Those employees represent the vast majority of its remaining staff.",

If you had a concern about safety at your own home, you'd make a few calls and fill the gaps \u2014 not call in an army.

      "With Republicans in the majority, Democrats have argued that they should bear responsibility for keeping the government open, and should be willing to negotiate to do so. But Republicans have insisted that there's no need, since Democrats regularly support \"clean\" continuing resolutions to keep the government funded.",
      "Thune told NBC that Democrats are using a seven-week funding resolution, designed to give lawmakers more time to work on the appropriations process, to \"try and get a whole laundry list of things that they want,\" accusing them of taking \"the federal government as a hostage.\" He added that he doesn't know \"what we're supposed to be negotiating.\"",
      "\"This is a simple, straightforward deal to keep the government running,\" the South Dakota Republican said, urging that Democrats should help keep the government funded, and then have a conversation about extending the health care subsidies.",
      "While Democrats have put the blame on Mr. Trump for a possible shutdown, Republicans have argued that any failure to fund the government will be Schumer's doing.",
      "Schumer has faced intense pressure from his party to stand up to the Trump administration and its policies in the spending fight, after he allowed Republicans to move ahead with their spending bill during the last funding dispute.",
      "After pledging to fight the GOP funding plan in March, Schumer changed course at the eleventh hour and delivered one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown. Schumer argued at the time that a shutdown risked more damage, despite intense criticism from some within his own party.",
      "But that was before Republicans in Congress approved their \"big, beautiful bill,\" which included restrictions to Medicaid that Democrats vehemently opposed, along with a rescissions package clawing back more than $9 billion in congressionally appropriated funds for foreign aid and public broadcasting. Now, Schumer's posture appears to be different as well.",

Mr. Trump's accounts on Meta and X were restored in 2022, and his YouTube account was restored in 2023.",
      "In January, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, agreed to pay $25 million to Mr. Trump to settle a 2021 lawsuit over its own suspension of his accounts following the Capitol attack. A month later, X agreed to pay Mr. Trump $10 million to settle its lawsuit, which was filed before billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk bought the platform.",
      "The lawsuit against YouTube argued that the suspension violated Mr. Trump's First Amendment rights because it was allegedly done \"in response to coercion of the federal government.\" Attorneys for the tech firm had called that argument \"meritless\" in a 2021 court filing, and said forcing the platform to host Mr. Trump without any restrictions \"would conflict with YouTube's own First Amendment rights.\"",
      "In settling the lawsuit, YouTube and its parent company, Google parent Alphabet, agreed to pay $22 million to Mr. Trump, all of which will be directed into the Trust for the National Mall, a fund that is \"dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating that National Mall\" and \"to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom\" that Mr. Trump is building.",
      "Some $2.5 million will go to the other plaintiffs in the case whose accounts were removed from the site, including the American Conservative Union.",

      "The Trump administration announced in July that a 90,000-square-foot ballroom with a seated capacity for 650 people will be constructed in the White House's East Wing.",
      "CBS News reported earlier this month that corporate and individual donors have pledged nearly $200 million to cover construction costs, and fundraising is ongoing. Google, R.J. Reynolds, Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin, Palantir and NextEra Energy have donated, sources told CBS News, and so have firms in the tech, manufacturing, banking and health industries.",

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S.\u00a0government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies would be expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even if lawmakers fail this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",

      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",

      "The news was first reported by Politico.",
      "The memo, obtained by CBS News, tells agencies to consider reduction-in-force notices \u2014 a federal term for layoffs \u2014 for employees in programs, projects or activities that have discretionary funding that stops on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. It also goes further and says that employees should get RIF notices if they're in programs or projects \"not consistent with the President's priorities.\"",

      "A digital reconstruction of a million-year-old skull suggests humans may have diverged from our ancient ancestors 400,000 years earlier than thought and in Asia, not Africa, a study found.",
      "The findings, published Thursday, are based on a reconstruction of a crushed skull discovered in China in 1990 and have the potential to resolve the long-standing \"Muddle in the Middle\" of human evolution, researchers said.",
      "But experts not involved in the work cautioned that the findings were likely to be disputed and pointed to ongoing uncertainties in the timeline of human evolution.",
      "The skull, labelled Yunxian 2, was previously thought to belong to a human forerunner called Homo erectus.",
      "But modern reconstruction technologies revealed features closer to a species previously thought to have existed only later in human evolution, including the recently discovered Homo longi and our own Homo sapiens.",
      "\"This changes a lot of thinking,\" said Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, London, who was part of the research team.",
      "\"It suggests that by 1 million years ago, our ancestors had already split into distinct groups, pointing to a much earlier and more complex human evolutionary split than previously believed,\" he added.",
      "The findings shocked the research team.",
      "\"From the very beginning, when we got the result, we thought it was unbelievable. How could that be so deep into the past?\" Xijun Ni, a professor at Fudan University who co-led the analysis, told BBC News. \"But we tested it again and again to test all the models, use all the methods, and we are now confident about the result, and we're actually very excited.\"",

      "The scientists relied in part on another similar skull to shape their model, and then compared it to over 100 other specimens.",
      "The resulting model \"shows a distinctive combination of traits,\" the researchers said, some of them similar to Homo erectus, including a projecting lower face.",
      "But other aspects, including its apparently larger brain capacity, are closer to Homo longi and Homo sapiens, according to the study.",
      "\"Yunxian 2 may help us resolve what's been called the 'Muddle in the Middle,' the confusing array of human fossils from between 1 million and 300,000 years ago,\" Stringer said in a press release.",
      "Much about human evolution remains debated, and Petraglia said the study's findings were \"provocative\" though grounded in solid work.",
      "\"It's sound, but I think the jury's still out. I think there will be a lot of questions raised,\" he said.",
      "Andy Herries, an archeologist at La Trobe University, said he was not convinced by the conclusions and that genetic analysis had shown fossil morphology, or shape, was \"not always a perfect indicator for human evolution.\"",
      "\"They've got this interpretation that I just don't really think is taking into account the genetic histories of these things that we do know,\" he told AFP.",
      "Dr. Aylwyn Scally, an evolutionary geneticist at Cambridge University, told BBC News that although the study's conclusions were plausible, they were far from certain, and that more evidence was needed to be sure.",
      "\"That picture is still quite unclear to us, so if the conclusions of this research are supported by other analyses, ideally from some genetic data, then I think we would start to be increasingly confident about it,\" he told BBC News.",

      "All ChatGPT users will have access to the control features from Monday onward, the company said.",
      "The announcement comes as OpenAI, which technically allows users as young as 13 to sign up, contends with mounting public pressure to prioritize the safety of ChatGPT for teenagers. (OpenAI says on its website that it requires users ages 13 to 18 to obtain parental consent before using ChatGPT.)",
      "In August, the California-based technology company pledged to implement changes to its flagship product after facing\u00a0a wrongful death lawsuit\u00a0by parents of a 16-year-old who alleged the chatbot led their son to take his own life.",
      "OpenAI's new controls will allow parents to link their own ChatGPT accounts to the accounts of their teenagers \"and customize settings for a safe, age-appropriate experience,\" OpenAI said in Monday's announcement. Certain types of content are then automatically restricted on a teenager's linked account, including graphic content, viral challenges, \"sexual, romantic or violent\" role-play, and \"extreme beauty ideals,\" according to the company.",
      "Along with content moderation, parents can opt to receive a notification from OpenAI should their child exhibit potential signs of harming themselves while interacting with ChatGPT.",
      "\"If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation,\" the company said. \"If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out.\"",
      "The company also said it is \"working on the right process and circumstances in which to reach law enforcement or other emergency services\" in emergencies where a teen may be in imminent danger and a parent cannot be reached.",
      "\"We know some teens turn to ChatGPT during hard moments, so we've built a new notification system to help parents know if something may be seriously wrong,\" OpenAI said.",
      "OpenAI has introduced other measures recently aimed at helping safeguard younger ChatGPT users. The company said earlier this month that chatbot users identified as being under 18 will automatically be directed to a version that is governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules.",
      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said at the time.",
      "It noted on Monday, however, that while guardrails help, \"they're not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\"",
      "People can use ChatGPT without creating an account, and parental controls and automatic content limits only work if users are signed in.",

      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",

The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",

    "story": [
      "YouTube creators whose accounts were banned for violating previous policies against COVID-19 and election misinformation will be given the chance to rejoin the platform, said Alphabet, YouTube's parent company, on Tuesday.",
      "In a letter submitted in response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, attorneys for Alphabet said the decision to bring back banned accounts reflected the company's commitment to free speech.",
      "\"No matter the political atmosphere, YouTube will continue to enable free expression on its platform, particularly as it relates to issues subject to political debate,\" the letter read, noting that a number of accounts were kicked off the platform between 2023 and 2024 for violating misinformation rules that don't exist anymore. Now, it said, \"YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect.\"",
      "The company in its letter also said it \"values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse\" and added that YouTube \"recognizes these creators are among those shaping today's online consumption, landing 'must-watch' interviews, giving viewers the chance to hear directly from politicians, celebrities, business leaders, and more.\"",
      "The move is the latest in a cascade of content moderation rollbacks from tech companies, who cracked down on false information during the pandemic and after the 2020 election but have since faced pressure from President Trump and other conservatives who argue they unlawfully stifled right-wing voices in the process.",
      "It comes as tech CEOs, including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, have sought a closer relationship with the Republican president, including through high-dollar donations to his campaign and attending events in Washington.",
      "YouTube in 2023 phased out its policy to remove content that falsely claims the 2020 election, or other past U.S. presidential elections, were marred by \"widespread fraud, errors or glitches.\" Claims of fraud in the 2020 election have been debunked.",
      "The platform in 2024 also retired its standalone COVID-19 content restrictions, allowing various treatments for the disease to be discussed. COVID-19 misinformation now falls under YouTube's broader medical misinformation policy.",
      "Among the creators who have been banned from YouTube under the now-expired policies are prominent conservative influencers, including Dan Bongino, who now serves as deputy director of the FBI. For people who make money on social media, access to monetization on YouTube can be significant, earning them large sums through ad revenue.",
      "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan and other congressional Republicans have pressured tech companies to reverse content moderation policies created under former President Joe Biden and accused Biden's administration of unfairly wielding its power over the companies to chill lawful online speech.",
      "In Tuesday's letter, Alphabet's lawyers said senior Biden administration officials \"conducted repeated and sustained outreach\" to coerce the company to remove pandemic-related YouTube videos that did not violate company policies.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and wrong when any government, including the Biden Administration, attempts to dictate how the Company moderates content, and the Company has consistently fought against those efforts on First Amendment grounds,\" the letter said.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also accused the Biden administration of pressuring employees to inappropriately censor content during the COVID-19 pandemic. Elon Musk, the owner of the social platform X, has accused the FBI of illegally coercing Twitter before his tenure to suppress a story about Hunter Biden.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pfizer has agreed to offer significantly discounted prices for some prescription drugs for all American consumers and has committed to offer prescription medications to Medicaid at lower prices, President Trump announced Tuesday. The president said the drugs will be available for purchase online on a website operated by the federal government, which the White House has said will be called \"TrumpRx.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced most favored nation cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "The president said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",
      "Standing by Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla called this an \"historic day\" because the drugmaker is reversing an \"unfair situation.\"",
      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs. He threatened to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they failed to do so.",
      "Monday was the deadline for drugmakers to reach agreements to bring down drug costs, the Post reported, after the president's May executive order. While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population and uses about 13% of the world's prescription drugs, the U.S. funds over 70% of global pharmaceutical profits, according to the White House.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C., said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House have released specific drug prices yet.",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRX\" website have not yet been shared.",
      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "The announcement also comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

    "story": [
      "A possible U.S. government shutdown\u00a0on Wednesday could hinge on a deal to maintain a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could rise by an average of 75% after the tax credits expire, according to KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

    "story": [
      "\"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty has learned a suspect has been identified in the 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop. This is according to one of the original investigators who worked the case.",
      "That suspect is Robert Eugene Brashers, who is deceased, says retired Austin detective John Jones.",
      "Brashers is a serial killer and rapist who committed at least three murders between 1990 and 1998 in the states of South Carolina and Missouri. He died in January 1999 by suicide during a standoff with police. The gun he used to shoot himself is believed to be consistent with a bullet casing found in a drain inside the yogurt shop, says Jones.",
      "The connection between Brashers and the case was made through DNA, Jones told Moriarty.",
      "Moriarty has reported on the yogurt shop case since the very beginning.",
      "On Dec. 6, 1991, 17-year-old Eliza Thomas, 13-year-old Amy Ayers, and two sisters, 17-year-old Jennifer Harbison and 15-year-old Sarah Harbison, were found gagged, tied up with their own clothing, and shot in the head in an I Can't Believe It's Yogurt! shop in Austin. The person responsible had also set the shop on fire, compromising much of the evidence.",
      "Eliza and Jennifer had been working at the yogurt shop that night. They were getting ready to close when Jennifer's sister, Sarah, and their friend, Amy, met them there to head home.",
      "Following the crime, the Austin Police Department developed a task force dedicated solely to solving the case. Government agencies, including the FBI, were called in to assist, but the case ultimately went cold until 1999, when four men, Robert Springsteen, Michael Scott, Maurice Pierce and Forrest Welborn, were arrested and charged with the murders.'",
      "The men were only teenagers at the time of the crime. They were first questioned just days after the murders when one of them, Maurice Pierce, was arrested at a mall not far from the yogurt shop with a .22 caliber gun \u2014 one of the same types of weapons believed to have been used in the killings.",
      "All four were released back then for lack of evidence, but in 1999, when a new team of investigators were tasked with taking a fresh look at the old case, they obtained confessions from two of the four men, Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott. Those confessions would later be called into question after the two recanted, saying they were coerced.",
      "Charges were ultimately dropped against Maurice Pierce and Forrest Welborn due to lack of evidence, and Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott were the only two to go on trial. The sole evidence against them were their own words. They were both convicted, but a few years later, their convictions were overturned on constitutional grounds. The Sixth Amendment gives defendants the right to confront accusers and in Scott and Springsteen's trials, their confessions were used against one another, but they weren't allowed to question each other in court.",
      "Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County, Texas, district attorney at the time, was intent on retrying Springsteen and Scott. But before doing so, her office decided to take advantage of what was then a fairly new type of DNA testing called Y-STR testing. It was a way of searching for and extracting male DNA only. Y-STR testing was ordered on vaginal swabs taken from the victims at the time of the murders. By this point, investigators had come to believe that at least one of the victims had been sexually assaulted. As a result of the Y-STR testing, a partial male DNA profile was obtained from one of the girls, but to the surprise of the district attorney's office, the DNA sample did not match any of the four men who were arrested.",
      "Still, prosecutors were determined to retry Springsteen and Scott. But before doing so, they wanted to figure out who that mystery DNA belonged to. In 2009, with no matches, the charges against Springsteen and Scott were dropped. After nearly 10 years behind bars, they were released.",
      "For years, officials kept trying to track down the source of the mystery DNA and finally there was a match this month, according to original investigator John Jones.",

      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress, with lawmakers currently at loggerheads over funding the federal government past Sept. 30.",

      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date.

    "story": [
      "The first Gregory's Coffee opened in 2006 on Manhattan's Park Avenue. Nineteen years later, the family-owned business has expanded to over 54 locations around the U.S. as well as a roastery in Queens, New York, that handles coffee beans from Brazil, Rwanda, Nicaragua and other major global producers.",
      "For Gregory Zamfotis, founder of the New York City-based chain, the business is about more than just dollars and cents \u2014 it's also about recognizing the special place coffee has long had in American culture as a driver of social connections.",
      "\"Coffee is built into the fabric of our society,\" Zamfotis told CBS News. \"People come together over coffee. When it's a meeting or interview, or we just want to get some work done, coffee tends to be the centerpiece of those conversations.\"",
      "With many Americans still feeling the effects of elevated inflation, for many coffee drinkers one of those conversations is likely to center on the drink's soaring costs.",
      "Prices have leaped nearly 21% over the past 12 months, with the average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee recently reaching a record high of $8.87 per pound, up from $7.02 in January USDA data shows.",
      "Several factors are behind the spike in coffee prices, including droughts in Brazil and volatile weather in other regions where the bean is cultivated. More recently, heavy U.S. tariffs on coffee-producing countries \u2014 including a hefty 50% levy on Brazil \u2014 have also driven up prices.",
      "Though coffee is a staple of American daily life, the vast majority of the beans is imported. Much of that is sourced from Latin America, with Brazil alone accounting for 35%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. produces relatively little coffee compared to the rest of the world. Hawaii, the top-producing state, harvested 21 million pounds during the 2024\u201325 season, according to the USDA. Yet Americans consumed a whopping 3.3 billion pounds of coffee during the same period, the agency said.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up\"",
      "Jake Leonti, director of coffee at Gregory's Coffee, said it's also far pricier to grow and produce coffee in the U.S.",
      "\"It's exponentially [more] expensive because it's Americans farming,\" he said. \"Whereas we can get super high-quality coffee from different parts of the world at a price that's much more friendly to the consumer.\"",
      "Gregory's Coffee has not raised prices yet despite the jump in costs. But Leonti said that could change soon.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up \u2014 there's no other way around it,\" he said. \"We're seeing tariffs from the places where we get our bags printed as well. So everything around the coffee business is getting tariffs at some point.\"",
      "Like other retailers, Gregory's prices vary depending on where a store is located, reflecting regional labor and other costs. In New York City, the chain charges $3.45 for a regular cup of coffee, while at its New Jersey and Washington, D.C., outlets the same item runs $3.15.",
      "Other retailers are also preparing for increased coffee costs. Mark Smucker, CEO of The J.M. Smucker Co., whose portfolio includes the Folgers Coffee, Caf\u00e9 Bustelo and Dunkin' at-home brands, said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in June that prices will likely increase for a third time this year \"due to higher green coffee costs.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Catherine R. Smith said during the company's third-quarter earnings call in July that, due to the company's coffee buying and hedging practices, customers shouldn't expect price increases until the first half of fiscal 2026.",
      "At Gregory's Coffee, \"The last thing we want to do is just keep raising prices on our guests,\" Zamfotis said. \"We're hoping that if prices go up a few pennies across the board, that doesn't turn off our everyday customers.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress appears to be barreling toward another government shutdown, with President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward for averting a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump said Sunday that a shutdown is likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, year-long spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government is on the verge of shutting down if Congress does not reach a deal to approve new funding by Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025.",
      "Republicans have proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides are dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during a government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs if Congress remains at an impasse over government funding, with a shutdown set to begin Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill has stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes are needed to advance it. Democrats want an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans have opposed. Without a resolution, the government will begin to shut down on Wednesday.",
      "If funding lapses, federal employees in critical positions would be required to stay on the job. Many others would be forced to stay home. Both groups would have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown threat means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid if there's a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck even if they haven't reached a deal to fund the government.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" This means they must get paid whether or not other parts of the government are funded.",
      "Pursuant to that section, members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election. Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

      "They filed their sentencing recommendation shortly after midnight, including letters from some of his accusers describing how his violence and demands had impacted their lives.",
      "Prosecutors called Combs \"unrepentant\" and said Combs had conceded his acts of violence and abuse throughout his trial but \"incredibly ... he now argues that his victims should shoulder the blame.\"",

      "The elaborate dayslong, drug-fueled sexual events were often filmed by Combs. Defense attorneys have asked that he be sentenced to no more than 14 months in prison. Sentencing is set for Friday. The music mogul had pleaded not guilty to all of the charges brought against him.",

      "The same jury acquitted the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that could have resulted in a life sentence.",
      "Last week, the defense submitted its presentence arguments, saying Combs has suffered enough during his nearly 13 months behind bars and that he should be freed soon.",
      "They wrote that he became a changed man in a Brooklyn federal lockup, where he has been under constant suicide watch and learned to react calmly rather than violently to threats, even when a fellow inmate confronted him with a shiv.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate returns to Washington on Monday with less than two days to fund the government amid a stalemate between Democrats and Republicans on the path forward that has increased the likelihood of a government shutdown this week.",
      "Lawmakers were away on recess last week after the House approved a GOP-led continuing resolution to keep the government funded until Nov. 21. But the measure fell short in the Senate, as Democrats pushed a counter-proposal that would keep the government funded through October, while attaching a handful of their priorities. That measure also failed to secure the necessary support for passage.",
      "Republicans have 53 seats in the Senate, a majority. But with 60 votes needed to advance most legislation in the upper chamber, Republicans can't approve a bill to fund the government without the help of Democrats.",
      "With few opportunities to exert influence with a GOP-controlled House, Senate and White House, Democrats have been pushing to extract a more favorable outcome in the spending fight, facing pressure from their base to push back on the Trump administration's policies. But the posture has proven complicated for the party that has repeatedly supported efforts to keep the government funded.",
      "Democrats push for negotiations",
      "Both parties have pushed for a stopgap measure to keep the government funded while work on full-year appropriations bills continues, but Democrats have advocated for weeks for taking the funding effort to the negotiating table, introducing a counter-proposal earlier this month that appeared to serve as an opening salvo.",
      "While the Republican-led continuing resolution would fund the government until Nov. 21, the Democrats' proposal includes one of their key priorities \u2014 extending expiring health insurance subsidies.",
      "The proposal, which would extend government funding until Oct. 31 and boost security funding, includes a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which Democrats have suggested is a red line for their support. The subsidies, which were originally passed in 2021, are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Also in their proposed measure to fund the government, Democrats included language to roll back Medicaid restrictions in President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and restore funding for public broadcasters that was rescinded earlier this year.",
      "Democratic leaders have been pushing for a meeting with Mr. Trump on government funding. And the leaders are set to meet Monday with the president, alongside Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson after the president canceled an initial meeting last week, citing the Democrats' \"unserious and ridiculous\" demands.",
      "Then, the Trump administration upped the ante last week, when the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies Wednesday telling them to consider reduction-in-force notices, or layoffs, for employees in programs, projects or activities that received discretionary funding.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that he called Thune Friday and urged him to get the leaders together for a meeting. The next day, he said the White House told them the meeting was on for Monday afternoon.",
      "The New York Democrat called the meeting a \"first step,\" saying \"we need a serious negotiation.\"",
      "\"I think they felt the heat, and they now want to sit down,\" Schumer said. \"But the fundamental question hasn't been answered yet, and we'll see on Monday: are they serious about negotiating with us in a real way?\"",
      "But Mr. Trump said Sunday that a government shutdown is likely unless top Democrats back down from their negotiating position, telling CBS News \"I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue.\"",
      "The shutdown blame game",
      "Democrats and Republicans have preempted the possible shutdown in recent days, seeking to put the blame on the other party should Congress fail to fund the government \u2014 forcing federal agencies to halt non-essential functions.",
      "With Republicans in the majority, Democrats have argued that they should bear responsibility for keeping the government open, and should be willing to negotiate to do so. But Republicans have insisted that there's no need, since Democrats regularly support \"clean\" continuing resolutions to keep the government funded.",
      "Thune told NBC that Democrats are using a seven-week funding resolution, designed to give lawmakers more time to work on the appropriations process, to \"try and get a whole laundry list of things that they want,\" accusing them of taking \"the federal government as a hostage.\" He added that he doesn't know \"what we're supposed to be negotiating.\"",
      "\"This is a simple, straightforward deal to keep the government running,\" the South Dakota Republican said, urging that Democrats should help keep the government funded, and then have a conversation about extending the health care subsidies.",
      "While Democrats have put the blame on Mr. Trump for a possible shutdown, Republicans have argued that any failure to fund the government will be Schumer's doing.",
      "Schumer has faced intense pressure from his party to stand up to the Trump administration and its policies in the spending fight, after he allowed Republicans to move ahead with their spending bill during the last funding dispute.",
      "After pledging to fight the GOP funding plan in March, Schumer changed course at the eleventh hour and delivered one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown. Schumer argued at the time that a shutdown risked more damage, despite intense criticism from some within his own party.",
      "But that was before Republicans in Congress approved their \"big, beautiful bill,\" which included restrictions to Medicaid that Democrats vehemently opposed, along with a rescissions package clawing back more than $9 billion in congressionally appropriated funds for foreign aid and public broadcasting. Now, Schumer's posture appears to be different as well.",

Sanford also apparently used gas to start a fire at the church, officials said. Grand Blanc police chief William Renye  said officers were on the scene within 30 seconds after a 911 call and fatally shot Sanford, who killed four people and injured eight more.",
      "Sanford served in the U.S. Marines from 2004 to 2008, CBS News confirmed. He was an Iraq war veteran who deployed for several months during 2007 and 2008, according to service records provided by the Pentagon.",
      "White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said on Fox Monday morning that FBI Director Kash Patel told her Sanford \"hated people of the Mormon faith.\"",
      "\"From what I understand based on my conversations with the FBI director, all they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith, and they are trying to understand more about this, how premeditated it was, how much planning went into it, whether he left a note,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Kris Johns, who is running for city council in Burton, Michigan, which is near where the shooting happened in Grand Blanc Township, told CBS News he met Sanford at his home last week while campaigning. He said Sanford had a particular dislike of the Latter-day Saints church, which was previously known as the Mormon church. He said Sanford told him that the church's followers \"believe they're above Jesus.\"",
      "Johns said Sanford told him he moved to Utah for a fresh start to plow snow and that while he was there he started a relationship with a Latter-day Saints woman.",
      "Johns recalls Sanford telling him: \"They wanted me to get rid of my tattoos. They wanted me to do all this stuff, and I wouldn't do it.\"",
      "Johns said he and Sanford didn't talk politics.",
      "\"He said nothing about Charlie Kirk, nothing about our current president or past president,\" Johns said. \"He asked me about guns. I said I support the Second Amendment. We ended the conversation very positively.\"",

      "All ChatGPT users will have access to the control features from Monday onward, the company said.",
      "The announcement comes as OpenAI, which technically allows users as young as 13 to sign up, contends with mounting public pressure to prioritize the safety of ChatGPT for teenagers. (OpenAI says on its website that it requires users ages 13 to 18 to obtain parental consent before using ChatGPT.)",
      "In August, the California-based technology company pledged to implement changes to its flagship product after facing\u00a0a wrongful death lawsuit\u00a0by parents of a 16-year-old who alleged the chatbot led their son to take his own life.",
      "OpenAI's new controls will allow parents to link their own ChatGPT accounts to the accounts of their teenagers \"and customize settings for a safe, age-appropriate experience,\" OpenAI said in Monday's announcement. Certain types of content are then automatically restricted on a teenager's linked account, including graphic content, viral challenges, \"sexual, romantic or violent\" role-play, and \"extreme beauty ideals,\" according to the company.",
      "Along with content moderation, parents can opt to receive a notification from OpenAI should their child exhibit potential signs of harming themselves while interacting with ChatGPT.",
      "\"If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation,\" the company said. \"If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out.\"",
      "The company also said it is \"working on the right process and circumstances in which to reach law enforcement or other emergency services\" in emergencies where a teen may be in imminent danger and a parent cannot be reached.",
      "\"We know some teens turn to ChatGPT during hard moments, so we've built a new notification system to help parents know if something may be seriously wrong,\" OpenAI said.",
      "OpenAI has introduced other measures recently aimed at helping safeguard younger ChatGPT users. The company said earlier this month that chatbot users identified as being under 18 will automatically be directed to a version that is governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules.",
      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said at the time.",
      "It noted on Monday, however, that while guardrails help, \"they're not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\"",
      "People can use ChatGPT without creating an account, and parental controls and automatic content limits only work if users are signed in.",

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S.\u00a0government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies would be expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even if lawmakers fail this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "Barring a deal in Congress, a shutdown would begin at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",

      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",

    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is raising the stakes as Congress faces a looming deadline to pass a government funding bill.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies Wednesday night telling them to prepare layoff plans if there is a government shutdown, increasing the stakes ahead of Congress' Tuesday deadline to pass a government funding bill.",
      "The news was first reported by Politico.",
      "The memo, obtained by CBS News, tells agencies to consider reduction-in-force notices \u2014 a federal term for layoffs \u2014 for employees in programs, projects or activities that have discretionary funding that stops on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. It also goes further and says that employees should get RIF notices if they're in programs or projects \"not consistent with the President's priorities.\"",
      "The RIF notices would be in addition to any furlough notices directing federal workers to stay home from work without pay if there is a shutdown, the memo states.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo states.",
      "An OMB official said that several programs will continue regardless of a shutdown, including Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits, military operations, law enforcement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and air traffic control. These are statutory federal programs and would not be impacted by any potential reductions-in-force.",
      "\"We remain hopeful that Democrats in Congress will not trigger a shutdown and the steps outlined above will not be necessary. The President supports enactment of a clean CR to ensure no discretionary spending lapse after September 30, 2025, and OMB hopes the Democrats will agree,\" the memo ends with.",
      "During the last few major government shutdowns, the executive branch has temporarily furloughed staff who are deemed non-essential and asked people in critical jobs to keep working without pay. After the shutdown ends, federal workers are normally paid back for their missed paychecks. It's far less common for the government to consider permanent layoffs.",
      "Bobby Kogan, a former OMB official during the Biden administration, said the mass firings would be \"an action of enormous self-harm inflicted on the nation, needlessly ridding the country of talent and expertise.\"",
      "\"It's also extortive. 'Give us what we want in a funding fight, or we'll hurt the country,'\" Kogan said in a statement.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called the memo \"an attempt at intimidation.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one \u2014 not to govern, but to scare. This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government,\" he wrote, predicting that any laid-off workers will be hired back.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, also a New York Democrat, wrote on X: \"We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings. Get lost.\"",
      "The current fiscal year ends on Tuesday, Sept. 30, meaning the government will enter a shutdown Wednesday if Congress doesn't pass a new funding package.",
      "A Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House has failed to reach the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate. With a 53-seat Senate majority, Republicans need to earn the support of at least seven Democrats to resolve the funding dispute. Meanwhile, Democrats are asking for several concessions, including a rollback of this year's Medicaid cuts and an extension to health insurance tax credits, in exchange for their votes.",
      "On Tuesday, President Trump canceled a meeting with Democratic congressional leaders to negotiate on a short-term funding patch, saying that their demands were \"unserious and ridiculous.\"",
      "\"I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,\" he wrote on Truth Social.",

    "story": [
      "Canadian authorities have identified a person known as \"The Woman in the Well\" nearly two decades after her remains were found.",
      "The woman, Alice Spence, was born in September 1881 and had moved to Canada from Minnesota in 1913, police said.",
      "In June 2006, crews excavating a site in Sutherland, Saskatoon, found an old well and a barrel containing preserved human remains, according to a news release from the Saskatoon Police Service. The area was previously the site of the Shore Hotel, a boarding house that was demolished in 1927, according to a news release from the private genetic genealogy company Othram.",
      "The woman had been partially dismembered, police believed, and was wrapped in a burlap sack and stuffed in the barrel, Othram said. Police found clothes, including a fitted jacket and long skirt, that dated to between 1910 and 1920, Othram said. A broken necklace and men's clothing were also found.",
      "An autopsy determined the woman had died under suspicious circumstances, but authorities were unable to identify her despite years of investigation. Police developed a DNA profile, but found no matches, and facial reconstruction images released to the public turned up no answers, Othram said.",
      "In 2023, the Saskatoon Police Services submitted forensic evidence from the case to Othram. Othram's scientists were able to develop a DNA extract from the skeletal evidence. They built a comprehensive DNA profile, Othram said, which was used to generate \"new investigative leads\" that were returned to the police service.",
      "A breakthrough came in June this year, Saskatoon Police Service Sergeant Darren Funk said in a news conference. At an event in Ottawa, Funk heard the Toronto Police Service describe how they had used investigative genetic genealogy to solve a homicide. Investigative genetic genealogy uses the DNA of people who were related to the subject to help make an identification.",
      "Funk connected with the Toronto Police Service and asked them to review the case of \"The Woman in the Well.\" The Toronto Police Service's follow-up investigation led investigators to people who may have been the woman's relatives. Police collected reference DNA samples from those subjects, and those samples were compared to the woman's DNA profile. Authorities also used historical information and city archives to help make the identification.",
      "Alice Spence was married to a man named Charles Spence and had a daughter, Idella, police said. Spence's listing in a 1916 census was the last proof of life historians could find for her.",
      "The family's home in Sutherland was destroyed by a fire in 1918, police said. Other records show Charles and Idella Spence living with a housekeeper in 1921. Investigators believe that Alice's death occurred sometime between 1916 and the fire in 1918.",
      "Spence's descendants, located through forensic genetic genealogy, were largely unaware of their relative and her death, police said.",
      "The police service said it believes this is the oldest investigation in Canada to be solved with the assistance of investigative genetic genealogy. Saskatoon Police Service Chief Cameron McBride called it a \"testament to the determination and innovation of investigators throughout all these years.\"",

      "Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair would also be on the \"Board of Peace,\" and, according to the plan, Israel would maintain security control around the perimeter of Gaza.\u00a0Speaking Monday after his appearance with Mr. Trump, Netanyahu indicated that Israeli forces would remain \"in most parts of the Strip\" at least until all of the hostages were returned.",
      "A diplomatic source with knowledge of the talks told CBS News that an Egyptian official and the Qatari prime minister had provided Hamas representatives with a copy of the proposal.",
      "The Palestinian Authority, which partially administers areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, issued a statement supporting the plan, which was published by the PA-linked WAFA news agency.",
      "In its statement, the PA stressed \"the importance of the partnership with the United States in achieving peace in the region,\" and reaffirmed its commitments to certain reforms, including \"holding Presidential and Parliamentary elections within one year after the end of the war.\"",
      "\"We have affirmed that we desire a modern, democratic, non-militarized Palestinian state that is committed to pluralism and the peaceful transfer of power,\" the statement said.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal does not include any immediate role for the PA in administering post-war Gaza, but it says the organization could eventually \"securely and effectively take back control of Gaza\" once it has implemented a series of reforms.",
      "The leaders of a number of Muslim majority nations, including key states in the Middle East, quickly signalled support for the plan. Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar issued a joint statement welcoming Mr. Trump's \"sincere efforts to end the war in Gaza\" and asserting their \"confidence in his ability to find a path to peace.\"",
      "\"They emphasize the importance of the partnership with the United States in securing peace in the region. Along these lines, the ministers welcome the announcement by President Trump regarding his proposal to end the war, rebuild Gaza, prevent the displacement of the Palestinian people and advance a comprehensive peace, as well as his announcement that he will not allow the annexation of the West Bank,\" the joint statement said.",
      "The president of the European Council, Antonio Costa, said he was \"encouraged by Prime Minister Netanyahu's positive response\" to the U.S. proposal, and that \"all parties must seize this moment to give peace a genuine chance,\" CBS News partner network BBC News reported.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, told CBS News that \"anything that brings us to a ceasefire, to the release of hostages, to an end to the carnage that we see, and an end to the incredible suffering, and a pathway for peace is welcome.\"",
      "\"Anyone can govern Gaza, but we don't want another war like the one from the 7th of October. And the second thing: We don't want the Israeli army to enter our homes like what happened in 1948,\" one man in the Gazan city of Deir al Balah said. He told CBS News he had been displaced 14 times during the war. \"Trump's proposal doesn't matter. Trump is Israel. The U.S. is with Israel. Israel is America. The Arab states all conspired against us, and America is Israel.\"",
      "\"Anything that ends the bloodshed and the fighting is good. Anything that will end the slaughter that we are going through,\" another man in Deir al Balah told CBS News.",
      "Asked whether he'd be satisfied if a peace deal came at the cost of postponing any plans for the creation of an independent Palestinian state, he said: \"Everything, all of that will be solved afterwards, after our situation is stabilized, and that can all be solved later on. We are very optimistic in God.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"You know, 50 meters underground, you actually understand the meaning in life,\" said Eli Sharabi. For 491 days, Sharabi was a Hamas hostage. \"That it's not your academic degrees and not your profession,\" he said. \"You miss your family and friends, and just wish for another minute with them.\"",
      "Held captive deep in tunnels under Gaza, Sharabi always imagined returning to his home in the Israeli Kibbutz Be'eri. \"Sunday Morning\" was with him earlier this month when he returned for the first time since his release. Time has seemingly stopped in this community just three miles from Gaza. Two years on, the shrubbery has grown up around his house. But there's no concealing the pain here.",
      "\"Wow,\" Sharabi said, getting emotional. \"I remember they grabbed me from here.\"",
      "His wife, Lianne, and their daughters, 16-year-old Noiya and 13-year-old Yahel, were still inside, as Hamas terrorists overran their kibbutz, killing 101 of its residents.",
      "He said, \"This place used to help so much to Palestinian civilians \u2013 send them money and take some of them from the border to hospitals in Israel.\" Those memories are hard to reconcile with his last moments here.",
      "He says he knew he was being kidnapped: \"I understood Arabic. My last second in the house, I just turned my head and like that to my daughters and said, 'I'll come back.'\"",
      "It's a nightmare he details in his book \"Hostage,\" a gripping account of his ordeal, in which he wrote on page one, \"Five terrorists enter with weapons drawn. We are in our pajamas; they come with uniforms, balaclavas, and Kalashnikovs. They found us.\"",
      "\"I will never forget the fears in my daughter's eyes,\" he said. \"It was horrible.\"",
      "In that horrible chaos of the day when 250 others were taken hostage, Sharabi was ultimately brought into a home and tied up.",
      "\"After 52 days, they moved us to the tunnels,\" he said. \"The first mosque we've seen, we got in, they opened the door on the floor, and we've seen the ladder and they asked us to climb down, something like 30 meters. It looked like the perfect grave.\"",
      "In the tunnels under Gaza, Sharabi was held with various hostages, including American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was later murdered by Hamas at age 24. Golberg-Polin often repeated a quote which stuck with Sharabi: \"He who has a why to live, can bear any how.\"",
      "\"You're looking for any source that give you hope, that give you strength,\" Sharabi said.",
      "His captors told him his wife and daughters were alive, seen at protests campaigning for his release. It was the \"why\" he needed to cope with that torture in the tunnels.",
      "\"They beat us,\" Sharabi said. \"One time they broke my ribs and I couldn't breathe properly for two or three months, and my friend needed to help me to stand to go to the bathroom. They undressed us every two weeks and look for things that maybe we are going to attack them with them.\"",
      "What did that experience do to him? \"It's very humiliating moments for you,\" he said, \"and especially when you are chained to your friends, leg by leg, and you need to go to the bathroom with him \u2026 you have to go together. It's very, very humiliating moment. There's no running water, so you use bottles. You can see the worms everywhere. Worms, rats, cockroaches.\"",
      "When we were in Kibbutz Be'eri in mid-September, explosions could be heard as Israel stepped up its ground offensive in Gaza. \"It's not nice, these explosions,\" Sharabi said. \"Especially when you think it's another 48 hostages remain there. Two years. It's awful for both sides.\"",
      "I asked, \"There are going to be people who watch this and say, 'You're giving this space to this man to share his story. What about the 60,000-plus people in Gaza who've been killed?'\"",
      "\"First of all, they need to remember who started October 7,\" Sharabi replied. \"If someone can explain to me how you fighting against a terror organization that hiding behind his own population without people to get hurt, innocent people, I don't know how to do it.\"",
      "He worries especially about another captive he left behind: 24-year-old Alon Ohel. Sharabi became a father figure to him in their year-plus together, and when Sharabi found out he was going to be freed, Ohel was not on the list. \"You imagine this moment hundreds of times,\" Sharabi said. \"And you believe it's going to be the happiest moment ever. And because of Alon, this moment become very complicated. He had small panic attack. He started to cry and shaking. So, we took water, washed his face, hugging him. It wasn't easy.\"",
      "He says his mission now is to bring all of the hostages home. Sharabi has been fighting to get the remaining living hostages out, along with the bodies of those, like his brother, Yossi, who were killed in captivity.",
      "Sharabi's emotions are often close to the surface, but kept in check, even describing the unimaginable: being shackled. \"We were chained with iron chains on our legs, 24/7,\" he said. \"Every step you make, it's not more than three inches. It was a week before the release when they took it off, and our legs start to fly all over the place. We couldn't control them because we didn't know how to walk.\"",
      "When he was released, he'd lost 66 pounds. The handover was terrifying, he says, but he could endure anything just to hug his wife and daughters again. Then, he heard this from the social worker greeting him in Israel: Your mother and your sister waiting for you.",
      "Sharabi said when he heard that he said, \"'Well, just bring me Lianne and my daughters.' And she said, 'Well, your mother and your sister will tell you.'\"",
      "Lianne, Noiya and Yahel were among the 1,200 people killed on October 7, 2023.",
      "Next to their graves is a place for his brother, Yossi.",
      "Today, Sharabi said, \"I choose life. I need to be strong for them. I don't have the privilege to break. I'm really grateful for my second chance.\"",
      "He says he thinks of his wife and daughters and the life they missed. \"But I'm very positive the life I'm going to rebuild,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"How can you be so positive after losing so much?\"",
      "\"I love life. I love life,\" he replied. \"I'm very proud that I'm that meaningful for other people. It's the most moving feeling that you can feel, that people care about you. People say for me, 'We lose simple things, and we think our world is finished. And you lost your brother, your wife, and your daughters, and you're smiling today. How's that possible?'\"",
      "And his response? \"I can't do anything, anything that bring back Lianne, Noyia, Yahel, Yossi. And so, the best thing I can do for their memories is to be optimistic and to be strong and to rebuild my life.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Iranian authorities said Monday they had hanged a man they accused of spying for Israel, the latest in what is believed to be the largest wave of executions by Tehran in decades, according to activists monitoring human rights issues and the use of the death penalty in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Iran\u00a0identified the executed man as Bahman Choobiasl. His case hadn't previously been reported in Iranian state media to activists monitoring human rights issues and the use of the death penalty in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Iranian state media outlet\u00a0Mizan\u00a0reported Monday that Choobiasl \"had engaged in extensive and deliberate cooperation with the Israeli intelligence service in the field of databases.\" CBS News has reached out to Iranian authorities for comment.",
      "The execution came as Iran vowed to confront what it called its enemies after the United Nations reimposed sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear program this weekend. The European Union followed suit Monday, imposing similar sanctions on Iran.",
      "Iran accused Choobiasl of meeting with operatives from the Israeli spy agency Mossad, calling him the agency's \"most trusted\" spy. Iran's Mizan news agency, which is the judiciary's official mouthpiece, said Choobiasl worked on \"sensitive telecommunications projects\" and reported about the \"paths of importing electronic devices.\"",
      "Iran is known to have hanged nine people for espionage since its June war with Israel. Israel carried out 12 days of air strikes on Iran in June, killing at least 1,100 people according to Amnesty International.",
      "Earlier this month, the Iranian government executed Babak Shahbazi, according to Amnesty International's Iran chapter, which said in a\u00a0post on social media that Shahbazi's execution was \"arbitrary\" and \"horrific.\" Tehran had alleged that Shahbazi spied for Israel but human rights activists have disputed that, saying he was tortured into a false confession after he wrote a letter to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offering to fight for Kyiv. Iran has taken Russia's side in that conflict, giving its military critical support, including armed drones.",
      "The Islamic Republic routinely conducts closed-door trials of people accused of espionage and other crimes, with defendants often prevented from seeing or disputing the evidence against them.",
      "Iran has faced multiple nationwide protests in recent years, fueled by anger over the economy, demands for women's rights and calls for the country's theocracy to change.",
      "The Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights and the Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran put the number of people executed in 2025 at over 1,000, noting the number could be higher as the government does not report on each execution.",
      "United Nations human rights experts also criticized Iran's executions on Monday",
      "\"The sheer scale of executions in Iran is staggering and represents a grave violation of the right to life,\" U.N. experts from the Office of the High Commissioner said in a statement\u00a0Monday. \"With an average of more than nine hangings per day in recent weeks, Iran appears to be conducting executions at an industrial scale that defies all accepted standards of human rights protection.\"",
      "The United Nations reimposed sanctions on Iran\u00a0early Sunday on the grounds that it was violating its 2015 agreement to limit its nuclear program, further squeezing the Islamic Republic as growing numbers of Iranians struggle to afford basic needs.",
      "The sanctions will again freeze Iranian assets abroad, halt arms deals with Tehran, and penalize any development of Iran's ballistic missile program, among other measures. It came via a mechanism known as \"snapback,\" included in Iran's 2015 nuclear deal\u00a0with world powers, and comes as the country's economy already is reeling.",

      "The U.S.-made Tomahawk missile has a range of about 1,500 miles, which would place Moscow well within the range of Kyiv should the Ukrainian government obtain them.",
      "On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov implied that the U.S. was directly interfering in the war between Russian and Ukraine. \"Moscow has heard Washington's statements about possible Tomahawk deliveries to Ukraine and is carefully analyzing them,\" Peskov said at a news conference. \"It is important to understand who will be directing and launching the Tomahawk missiles from Ukrainian territory \u2014 the Americans or the Ukrainians themselves.\"",

The attacks killed four people and wounded dozens more, Ukrainian officials said, and was one of the largest aerial barrages Ukraine has faced since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022.",
      "Mr. Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Russia's failure to come to the table to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine, and he has offered Ukraine encouragement over the past week in its fight to repel Russian troops.",
      "\"Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like 'a paper tiger,'\" Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post Tuesday.",

With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option,\" Mr. Trump said.",

Democrats want to extend health care subsidies that were part of the Affordable Care Act, but President Trump said his focus on health care is on preventing undocumented migrants from having access to any of the U.S. health care system. Now, it's illegal for any non-citizen to have that sort of access, but President Trump says we're not going to have it. Quote, we're not going to allow it, in terms of moving forward on any discussion, unless the Democrats come to his side on health care and don't focus on the subsidies. But based on my conversations with top Democrats, that's not going to happen. So President Trump told me quote, I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue. That makes a shutdown quite likely. And inside the White House, sources are saying President Trump actually welcomes a shutdown in the sense that he believes he can wield executive power to get rid of what he calls waste, fraud and abuse. And there is that memo, as you mentioned, that says the government is ready to have mass firings if a deal isn't struck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Reductions in force, right. Well, we also know that the President took some extraordinary public statements in the past few days. He publicly said he wants to see Adam Schiff, now a senator, Letitia James prosecuted along with James Comey, the former FBI director who is now indicted. Yesterday, he twice posted on social media about former FBI Director Chris Wray. Did the President tell you, is he planning prosecutions?",
      "COSTA: I did not speak directly to the president about that today. But fishing around all weekend in his inner circle, it's clear, this is just the beginning in terms of possible prosecutions of those who have scrutinized the president or criticized him over the years. You mentioned the mortgage policy, potentially, of Senator Adam Schiff of California. He's being discussed inside of the Trump administration. So is Letitia James, the New York Attorney General, who sued the president over how he valued his real estate holdings. And there are others not even on our radar at this moment, like retired Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, who are being discussed as people who have, may have taken action against the administration or president in some way, allegedly, in the views of those inside. And they want to see the Justice Department hold them to account. There's such a gap right now in Washington. Republicans believe what President Trump is doing is accountability. Democrats are alarmed and see this as authoritarian government at work. And there's a real tension there that's not going away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. And a justice system that has to deal with evidence and facts.",
      "And we're going to talk about all of this ahead with some of our guests. Robert Costa, thank you very much for your reporting."

Before Amiri, it had helped secure the release of four other American citizens from Afghanistan earlier this year.",

Qatar began negotiating for his release in March, at first arranging a meeting between Amiri and the U.S. Special Envoy Adam Boehler during his visit to Afghanistan, according to the source with knowledge of his release.

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 28, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, who joins us this morning from Richmond. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have what, 140,000 federal civilian workers in your state, one of the highest numbers in the nation. How concerned are you that you will see mass layoffs if we go into the shutdown that the White House says they are preparing for?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, and I think your reporter Robert Costa said they're even welcoming it. We are really worried about it, Margaret. When Ted Cruz forced a shutdown of the government in October 2013, it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And when Donald Trump forced a shutdown of the government in late 2018, early 2019 it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And this one would be the same. The only thing about the President's threat to fire more people is he's already doing it, and instead of threatening, he should just be meeting to negotiate. We came near shut down deadlines during the Biden administration, but we never shut government down because the President would sit down with congressional leaders of both parties and would find a path forward. And that's what we've been asking for since the Democrats put an alternate plan on the table on September 18, just sit down and talk with us, and finally, he has agreed to do that tomorrow. But if you're reporting, is to be believed, he's sort of going into it, setting reducing expectations improperly. He should be doing what presidents do and saying, we're going to find a deal to keep the government of the greatest nation on earth open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it enough of a deal to say, take the short term, seven week funding deal, and we'll continue to talk about these health care subsidies that Democrats say they are so concerned about. I mean, is it really worth the risk?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Here's, here's my thought about this, Margaret. And this is my personal view. We've got to solve this health care issue. And Republicans are saying the same thing. Mike Johnson has said it. Senator Cornyn has said it, Senator Hawley has said it. Senator Murkowski has said it. We're asking to fix a problem that even Republicans want to fix. I don't think we have to have every detail pinned down with all the Is dotted and Ts crossed in order to do a short term extension, but I do want to see that Republicans are saying, You're right. We can fix this, and here's the path to finding a fix. And the second thing we need, which is so reasonable, we're just asking, if we do a deal, please don't, Mr. President, sign the deal, and then immediately the next day start, starting to take away funds, rescinding agreements that you just made yesterday. A deal should be a deal, and we should all agree that Americans should not see their health care suffer, their premiums spike, and people lose insurance and providers close. We've already had providers in Virginia announce that they are closing their doors because of the bill that the Republicans passed in July, and this is happening all over the country. Let's just do what's right by our constituents and fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you another question specific to Virginia, and that is, what is going on inside the judicial system. Back in August, it was the US Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, Todd Gilbert, who suddenly resigned. Then earlier this month, the US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Eric Siebert resigned after failing to bring a case against New York's Attorney General, Letitia James. What is going on here in the Virginia court system? Margaret?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: It's pretty darn plain the President nominated two U.S. attorneys in Virginia, both with Republican bona fides. Todd Gilbert in the Western District, had been the Republican Speaker of our house of delegates. He resigned as a legislator to take the Trump appointment. President Trump's team interviewed these candidates, approved the candidates, nominated the candidates, and then even appointed them into the interim position. But both were forced out because they said their integrity as prosecutors would not allow them to genuflect to Donald Trump. And in Todd Gilbert's case, they wanted to force him to demote a long time career member of the Western District of Virginia who had served under multiple administrations and presidents. He refused to do so. And in Eric Siebert's case, he refused to bring a criminal charge against a perceived Trump political opponent when there was no evidence to support the charge. President Trump is spending time going after enemies, trying to figure out a way to give $20 billion to a friend, the Argentine Government, instead of dealing with the challenges we elected him to confront. Food prices are going up. Building supplies are going up. School supplies are going up. Energy costs are going up, health care costs are going up, and Donald Trump seems to be focused on a retribution campaign. You got to focus, man, this is an important job. It's time to focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to those Virginia cases, have you talked to Siebert, have you talked to Gilbert to understand why they felt they had to resign?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: I have talked to each of them after the resignations were done. These were individuals I knew both. I knew Todd Gilbert because of his legislative role, and I knew Eric Siebert very well by reputation. And again, this was the prosecutor Margaret, who, when the Biden administration transitioned to the Trump administration, the Trump administration DOJ put him in the role as an interim even before we recommended him, along with our republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, as you mentioned. So after they had been fired, yes, I did call and say I'd like to understand why you were forced out, and they shared thoughts with me without getting into anything about particular cases or particular communication they'd had with Trump administration officials. But I am convinced, and Virginians are convinced. I traveled around the state this week. People are talking about this. Both of these individuals had a backbone. They wouldn't genuflect to Donald Trump, and they wouldn't bring baseless cases, and we shouldn't see that in any district in this nation. And it's sad that President Trump is more focused on retribution than serving his constituents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that Eastern District did come forward with this, this indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. Yes, it was just a two page indictment, no evidence presented publicly here, but it was convincing enough to 14 of 23 people sitting on a grand jury. Can you really say there's no there there?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, a bare majority, as you know, Margaret, there's 23 people on a grand jury. They need at least 12 votes to get an indictment, and yes, they got their finger over the bar with 14, although the four- the 23 wouldn't agree on one of the charges that the US attorney was pushing. So we will see what this case is about. It is odd that the indictment has so few facts, and I found it very odd. I used to practice in this court, and when the Attorney General put out a press statement after the indictment and said, we will follow the facts in this case. What prosecutors follow the facts before they indict, they don't indict, and then say, well, let's see what the facts are. I think she even revealed that this is a weak case, which everyone in her office was telling her it was a weak case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You in your armed services role. I want to quickly ask you, you have said you are supportive of the creation of a Palestinian state, and we saw at the UN this past week, a large number of members just simply walked out when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke, it was a statement tomorrow he's going to be at the White House ahead of that meeting, President Trump said this:",
      "VO SOT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. There's been enough. It's time to stop now, okay?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a strong statement. Do you know how the United States should enforce that? How do you force Israel to step back from annexation?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, I was very heartened that the President said that, and you're right. I support what the United States voted for in the UN in 1947 a state of Israel and a state of Palestine. One of those promises has been met. One hasn't, and we need to be on a path for a Palestinian state that's demilitarized, where Hamas plays no role in its governance. And until we find that path forward, we're going to have continued cycles of violence that are bad for Israelis, bad for Palestinians, bad for the region. So I hope the president, who, by all accounts, has a strong relationship with Prime Minister Netanyahu, makes plain that we are, we are against annexation, and this 21 point proposal that the President has on the table, which is pretty similar to the New York dialog being led by the French and the Saudis. They're different efforts, but they're trying to reach the same point, a future state for Israel and Palestine, where both can live in peace, and creating stability in the region instead of the cycles of violence. So I hope the president leans into that at the meeting tomorrow. I was heartened by his comment. It would be a big mistake for the Prime Minister Netanyahu to look at all of these nations that have been allies, saying you need to change course, and for him to just pull his head in the shell and turn inward and continue to isolate Israel, rather than move forward toward peace and more stability in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Kaine, thank you for your insights today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "Petro, who has a history of speaking off the cuff in meandering, ideologically charged speeches, also said on social media that \"I don't care\" about the punishment because he is also a European citizen. That means he does not need a visa to travel to the U.S.",

The White House has offered scant information about how the operations came together or the legal authorities under which they were carried out.",
      "Earlier this year, Petro resisted deportation flights using American military aircraft, leading to a diplomatic crisis as Trump threatened to retaliate with higher tariffs and visa suspensions. The U.S. is Colombia's largest trading partner, and Petro's government relented, saying it would accept the planes.",
      "The U.S. accused Colombia earlier this month of failing to cooperate with anti-narcotics efforts. Although the designation did not include sanctions that would have slashed U.S. assistance to the country, it was a sharp rebuke that frustrated Petro.",

      "He continued, \"I got a place at the beach, and I was hiding out there, trying to be alone, trying to decompress somehow, because it was killing everyone. It\u2019s early in the morning when I drive into town, and I happen to stop to see Diane, who has an apartment in a house there. Shortly after I arrive, there is a knock at the door.\"",
      "\"This is not a security-buzz-you-in place, not a gated residence, just an apartment that opens to the street,\" Richie added. \"When the door opens, Brenda is standing there. There is a massive confrontation. Diane is in total shock and I\u2019m trying to leave, to draw Brenda away. It\u2019s the most awful screaming match of my life, and it\u2019s all in this small entryway.\"",

      "\"The question is \u2014 How to stop it? How do you physically move a tragedy that is exploding in front of you?\" Richie wrote. \"I believed that if I left, Brenda would leave. She did get in her car, at first. But once I was gone, she went back and resumed the argument. The neighbors called the police. Charges were brought and then dropped.\"",
      "\"The story became the scandal of my century,\" he recalled. \"It took on a life of its own. Thankfully, there was no social media.\"",
      "According to contemporaneous reports by UPI and the Los Angeles Times, Brenda, then 35, was arrested and booked on suspicion of corporal injury to a spouse, resisting arrest, trespassing, vandalism, battery, and disturbing the peace.",

      "\"Normally, I\u2019d use my Southern upbringing to underplay the drama,\" the Tuskegee, Alabama, native wrote. \"Understatement is the watchword in the South.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s always a way to spin everything,\" Richie said. \"Not this time. The most painful part, the tragedy of our lives, was that Brenda was heartbroken. And I get it. Ladies and gentlemen, I get it. You never know what you are going to do or feel until you\u2019re in the moment and it\u2019s in your face. None of us had been in this situation.\"",
      "\"This wasn\u2019t Alabama; this was a brand-spanking new miniseries right here,\" he added. \"And nobody was prepared. We all deserved a pass because we didn\u2019t know what the story was going to be. It was just raw and ugly and disastrous.\"",
      "The singer recalled that the incident marked a turning point in his marriage with Brenda.",
      "\"Prior to that morning, I recall there was a cloud of uncertainty as to whether I wanted to try to reconcile and not be separated. From then on, though, the way back was harder to find,\" he wrote.",
      "\"That\u2019s the saddest day in the life of a marriage,\" he continued. \"When you know you may love each other, still, and you have a history that you will always have, but it\u2019s over. And you know it.\"",

      "Four months after initially threatening a 100% tariff on U.S. films that are produced in other countries other than the United States, President Donald Trump further advanced the plan by announcing his solution to the \"never-ending problem\" that is allegedly killing Hollywood.",
      "\"Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing \u2018candy from a baby.\u2019 California, with its weak and incompetent Governor, has been particularly hard hit!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday. \"Therefore, in order to solve this long time, never-ending problem, I will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States.\"",

      "When it comes to the future of Hollywood, Steve Honig, founder of the Honig Company, told Fox News Digital that the once glamorous home of filmmaking has truly \"lost itself.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, Hollywood, and the entire metropolitan Los Angeles area, has been dying a slow death for several years now as far as runaway production goes,\" said Honig. \"The cost of living and doing business in the area has become beyond cost-prohibitive, with other parts of the country and the world offering a lot more for a lot less.\"",
      "\"The problem is not limited to just Southern California but rather the entire state,\" he continued. \"While the current administration has tried to increase tax incentives for productions, it hasn\u2019t been enough to really move the needle very much. In addition to losing business, Hollywood has found itself with a reputation problem.\"",
      "Trump first announced his plan to implement a 100% tariff on foreign-produced films back in May.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)",
      "\"The Los Angeles area has become synonymous with high-costs and low-value among people in the industry, in particular the decision-makers,\" he added. \"This is going to be a tough issue to remedy because the problem goes a lot deeper than just tax incentives; it plays into the very soul of the city. Hollywood has lost itself in bad politics and economics.\"",
      "Doug Eldridge, founder of Achilles PR, says that Hollywood is not dead yet, but if the industry continues on this trajectory, a \"call to hospice is not far away.\"",
      "\"Why? Because of the decentralization of the creative process over the last 40 years. If you rewind the tape, the reason they called so many of those Clint Eastwood movies \u2018Spaghetti Westerns\u2019 is because it was cheaper to film in Italy--as well as southeastern Spain--than it was in Hollywood, or the Midwest, like most of the iconic John Wayne films, just 10-20 years earlier.\"",
      "\"Over the last couple of decades, Tinsel Town has lost its centralized strangle hold on movie-making, much in the same way that Detroit was unceremoniously dethroned as the auto-production capital of the world: tax breaks, cheaper labor, lack of union over-regulation, and advantageous incentives, all of which rendered Detroit a non-viable, cost-prohibitive option,\" Eldridge said.",
      "He explained that in recent years, other states have made moves to pull the movie industry out of California.",
      "Trump said in May that the movie industry is \"dying a very fast death.\" (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)",
      "\"Let me qualify that. In recent years, states like Texas and Georgia have taken aggressive measures to lure studio production away from the Golden State, in favor of more dollar-stretching climates. Georgia created a 20% tax credit, with an additional 10% credit on top of that, if producers used the Georgia peach logo in the end credits. Similarly, Texas has committed $1.5 billion in tax credits over the next decade, to producers who choose to film in remote, rural, locations across the state and are willing to utilize Texas residents in the production,\" he said.",
      "Eldridge continued, \"By contrast, California has become increasingly stringent: economically (escalating tax brackets), lack of incentives, and a post-Covid environment and economy that has never rebounded to a sense of normalcy, post-pandemic. At the end of the day, Hollywood producers face the same reality as the rest of America: where can you stretch your dollar the farthest\u2014Bergdorf's or Walmart? At a certain point, the discussion and decision becomes purely economical. California better have 'movie-making hospice' on speed-dial, because the outlook isn't good.\"",
      "In May, Trump wrote that the \"Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death.\"",
      "\"Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,\" Trump said. \"Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated.\"",
      "The president said that the situation was a \"concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat.\"",
      "\"It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!\" Trump wrote.",

      "Earlier this year, Rob Lowe took aim at the management within California when it comes to in-state filming and production.",

It\u2019s just tax, economics of it all, so it\u2019s criminal what California and L.A. have let happen \u2014 it\u2019s criminal. Everybody should be fired.\"",

It was originally scripted to take place in Malibu, but we couldn\u2019t shoot it there. It was just too expensive.\"",

It\u2019s become so cost-prohibitive on so many different fronts, and I\u2019m all for the unions, but it just balloons your budget.

      "HOW TO REVERSE PREDIABETES BEFORE IT LEADS TO TYPE 2 DIABETES",
      "Type 1 vs. type 2",
      "Type 2 diabetes is more common among adults, but can appear in children. The disease is linked to family history, age, obesity and unhealthy lifestyle factors, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

      "\"Type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance, which is caused by someone eating a diet high in sugars and carbs for decades, where the body perceives its own insulin as foreign and therefore resists it,\" Dr. Jeffrey Hockings, founder and CEO of Diabetes Reversal Group in Texas, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Experts agree that exercise is vital to longevity and helps to preserve muscle mass, bone density and joint health as we age. But it\u2019s important to approach workouts in the right way to ensure safe, optimal results.",
      "The general guideline is for healthy adults to get 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week, along with at least two days of strength training and activities to improve balance.",
      "However, these recommendations should be modified to meet each individual\u2019s physical abilities and conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "FITNESS EXPERT REVEALS 6 PILLARS OF STRENGTH TRAINING THAT OLDER ADULTS SHOULD MASTER",
      "\"Most adults are not failing in the gym because they are lazy. They are failing because no one ever taught them how to train for the stage of life they are in right now,\" Marfred Suazo, a fitness professional known as Fonz the Trainer in New York City, told Fox News Digital.",
      "The general guideline is for healthy adults to get 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week. (iStock)",
      "\"They keep doing the same workouts they did years ago and wonder why their back aches, their knees are sore and their progress has stalled.\"",
      "Fox News Digital spoke with fitness experts to identify some of the most common mistakes older adults make when working out and how to avoid them.",
      "\"Most people focus only on the chest, arms, quads and abs, because that is what they see in the mirror,\" Suazo said. \"But ignoring your back, glutes, hamstrings and core creates poor posture, weak links and, eventually, pain.\"",
      "OLDER ADULTS SHOULD TARGET THESE MUSCLES WHEN STRENGTH-TRAINING, SAYS FITNESS PRO",
      "To counteract this, Suazo recommends training the muscles you cannot see, a strategy he calls \"non-mirror training.\"",
      "\"Add rows, Romanian dead lifts, hip bridges, Paloff presses and farmer\u2019s carries to your routine,\" he advised. \"This type of training builds strength that shows up in your posture, balance and the way you move every day.\"",
      "Orrie Markfeld, a personal trainer at Life Time Garden City in New York, said a common mistake he sees is older adults trying to work out with the same intensity and volume as when they were younger, which often leads to overuse injuries and burnout.",
      "\"Most adults are not failing in the gym because they are lazy. They are failing because no one ever taught them how to train for the stage of life they are in right now,\" a fitness trainer said. (iStock)",
      "\"The solution is simple: train smarter,\" he recommended to Fox News Digital. \"Follow principles of progressive overload and proper mechanics and make recovery days a priority.",
      "\"Longer warm-ups, mobility prep and respecting rest go a long way toward preventing setbacks.\"",
      "\"Walking, biking and spin classes are great, but if you avoid strength training, you lose muscle and power with every passing year,\" Sauzo told Fox News Digital. \"That makes you more likely to get hurt and slows recovery.\"",
      "Building muscle helps protect the joints, speeds up metabolism and ensures strength for life, according to the expert.",
      "\"They keep doing the same workouts they did years ago and wonder why their back aches, their knees are sore and their progress has stalled.\"",
      "Suazo confirmed that adults should strength train at least two times per week. \"Start light, master the form and progress slowly,\" he recommends.",
      "Markfeld agreed that many older adults stick only to cardio, thinking it\u2019s all they need.",
      "Building muscle helps protect the joints, speeds up metabolism and ensures strength for life, experts say. (iStock)",
      "\"The problem is, skipping resistance training accelerates muscle and bone loss, which are critical for staying active and independent,\" he reiterated.",
      "\"Including two to three days a week of strength and resistance-specific work is ideal. This can be as simple as body weight movements, resistance bands or dumbbells, focusing on compound/functional movements like squats, pushes and pulls.\"",
      "Going straight from sitting at a desk to lifting weights is a recipe for injury, according to Suazo.",
      "\"Cold muscles and stiff joints make even simple exercises harder than they should be,\" he warned.",
      "HOLLYWOOD ICON HAS USED THE SAME 12-MINUTE WORKOUT ROUTINE SINCE THE 1960S",
      "To help ensure a safe, successful workout, Suazo recommends spending five minutes preparing your body. This can include walking as well as doing hip openers, shoulder circles and a few body weight squats.",
      "\"You will lift better, feel better and recover faster,\" the expert said.",
      "\"Fast, sloppy reps and ego lifting are the reason most people end up with sore shoulders and bad backs,\" Suazo cautioned.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The trainer emphasized the importance of slowing down.",
      "\"Choose a weight you can control, move with intention and feel the muscles working,\" he said. \"Controlled reps will keep you safe and build strength you can use.\"",
      "\"If you are sore all the time, you are not getting stronger, you are just breaking your body down,\" Suazo said. \"Strength is built when you recover, not just when you train.\"",
      "When you train this way, you will move better, feel younger and keep doing the things you love without pain holding you back,\" a trainer said. (iStock)",
      "It\u2019s important to make recovery part of your plan, the expert advised. This can include walking, stretching, taking an active recovery day and getting quality sleep.",
      "\"Your body will reward you by coming back stronger.\"",
      "\"Many people overlook mobility and balance work,\" Markfeld noted. \"These decline naturally with age and are major factors in injury risk.\"",
      "\"Focus on non-mirror training, slow your movements down and respect your recovery time.\"",
      "He suggests dedicating 10 to 15 minutes of every workout to joint mobility, core stability and balance exercises.",

      "Secretary of War Pete Hegseth is calling for servicemembers in combat roles to meet the highest male standards for physical fitness.",
      "Secretary of War Pete Hegseth announced on Tuesday that all combat personnel would be required to meet the highest male standard in order to maintain their positions.",
      "Hegseth said the department must \"restore a ruthless, dispassionate and commonsense application of standards.\"",
      "\"We're training warriors, not defenders. We fight wars to win, not to defend. Defense is something you do all the time, it's inherently reactionary and can lead to overuse, overreach, and mission creep. War is something you do sparingly, on our own terms and with clear aims,\" Hegseth said as he spoke Tuesday morning at Marine Corps Base Quantico.",
      "HEGSETH ORDERS ABOUT FACE ON PENTAGON'S SLIPPING GROOMING STANDARDS",
      "\"We fight to win. We unleash overwhelming and punishing violence on the enemy,\" he continued. \"We also don't fight with stupid rules of engagement. We untie the hands of our warfighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt and kill the enemies of our country. No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement, just common sense, maximum lethality and authority for warfighters.\"",

      "The secretary said that now, \"every member of the joint force at every rank is required to take a test twice a year, as well as meet height and weight requirements twice a year, every year of service.\" Additionally, members of the joint force will be required to do PT [physical training] every duty day, something Hegseth said is standard in many units but would be officially codified.",
      "\"If the Secretary of War can do regular hard PT, so can every member of our joint force,\" he said.",
      "Hegseth railed against \"fat troops\" and \"fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon,\" arguing that physical standards for American service members had eroded, and it was time to raise the bar.",

      "Hegseth noted that any altered physical standards \u2014 including those changed in 2015 \"when combat arms standards were changed to ensure females could qualify\" \u2014 had to be returned to their original form. He said this also included standards he claimed were \"manipulated to hit racial quotas,\" calling them \"just as unacceptable.\"",
      "While he said that the new requirement is for troops to meet the highest male standard, Hegseth insisted that the move was not meant to prevent women from serving their country.",
      "\"This is not about preventing women from serving. We very much value the impact of female troops. Our female officers and NCOs are the absolute best in the world. But when it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender-neutral. If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is,\" Hegseth said. \"If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result, so be it. It will also mean that we mean that weak men won't qualify because we're not playing games. This is combat. This is life or death.\"",
      "Hegseth also announced new grooming standards. Troops are now expected to be clean-shaven and have a uniform haircut. Soldiers are able to get temporary medical exemptions or permanent religious exemptions for the shaving rules.",
      "\"We're going to cut our hair, shave our beards and adhere to standards. Because it's like the broken windows theory of policing, it's like when you let the small stuff go, the big stuff eventually goes,\" Hegseth said. \"If you want a beard, you can join Special Forces. If not, then shave.\"",
      "Special Forces operators' beard exemptions are meant to help them better blend in with certain communities and civilians, according to the nonprofit Wounded Warrior Project.",
      "The Army announced in July that \"the new policy requires exemptions for non-religious reasons to be supported by a temporary medical profile (DA Form 3349-SG) and an exception-to-policy (ETP) memo granted by an O-5 officer in the chain of command.\"",

      "Further denouncing of wokeness in the military, Hegseth announced major changes aimed at offering leaders second chances. He said that the Department of War was well-aware that mistakes would be made with the new directives, and, as such, he also would be implementing changes to the retention of adverse information on personnel records. This means that leaders with \"forgivable, earnest, or minor infractions\" on their records will not spend the rest of their careers paying for those mistakes, allowing them to take control without fear.",

Your email provider can use them to refine their spam detection algorithms. The best course of action is to report them, so providers can develop better ways to identify harmful or unwanted messages.

Furthermore, your failure to contribute to this improvement means the problem persists not only for you but for others.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier explores how the technology is changing how the world operates on 'Special Report.'",
      "A New Jersey school district has adopted artificial intelligence to help detect weapons and stop threats before they escalate. The Glassboro Public School District has become the first in the country to combine AI gun detection with a mass communication system that speeds up emergency responses and reduces the time it takes to notify law enforcement.",

      "NORTH KOREAN HACKERS USE AI TO FORGE MILITARY IDS",
      "What's new in school security",
      "The district is using ZeroEyes, an AI video analytics platform that integrates with existing security cameras. The software scans for visible firearms and sends an alert whenever a potential threat appears. A team of military and law enforcement veterans at a 24/7 operations center then reviews the image to confirm whether the gun is real. Once verified, the system pushes an alert to school staff and police within three to five seconds. At the same time, buildings go into lockdown automatically.",
      "South Jersey schools have deployed AI to spot weapons and alert police in seconds. (Jay Janner/The Austin American-Statesman via Getty Images)",
      "These alerts are distributed through Singlewire Software's InformaCast platform. This system can send warnings across school PA systems, strobe lights, digital signs, desk phones and other communication tools. Together, the two technologies give law enforcement and educators a faster and more coordinated way to respond to potential dangers.",
      "How the system works",
      "Security cameras around each building feed video into the ZeroEyes software. When the AI detects what appears to be a firearm, it highlights the object and immediately shares the footage with human analysts. If those experts confirm that the weapon is real, they send the alert to the district and local authorities. InformaCast then pushes the message to every connected device, allowing staff and students to receive instructions within seconds. The goal is to shorten the time between detection and action so schools can respond before violence has a chance to unfold.",
      "Concerns to consider",
      "As with any new technology, questions remain. Even with human oversight, AI can make mistakes, and false alerts are always a possibility. Privacy also comes into play since the system depends on constant monitoring through security cameras. Cost is another factor because installing, maintaining and training staff for these systems requires significant funding. Finally, schools need to build community trust by explaining how the technology works and preparing students and parents for what to expect during drills or emergencies.",
      "SCAMMERS ARE ABUSING ICLOUD CALENDAR TO SEND PHISHING EMAILS",
      "Glassboro district becomes first in U.S. to pair AI gun detection with mass alerts. (Lori Van Buren/Albany Times Union via Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "For parents, teachers and students, this technology represents an important shift in how schools approach safety. AI adds speed to the process by recognizing threats before most people would even notice them. Alerts reach law enforcement and staff almost immediately, creating a critical advantage in a crisis. The system also provides a layered approach to protection by combining cameras, AI and communication tools. Parents may also find reassurance in knowing that human experts verify each threat to help reduce false alarms. While no system is perfect, this integration builds confidence that schools are investing in stronger defenses.",

They're sneaking fake websites into search results that look just like the real thing. If you click and download from one of these sites, you could end up with malware instead of the app you wanted.

These sites host installers for apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Deepl, Chrome, Telegram, Line, VPN services and WPS Office. The catch is that these downloads include both the real app and hidden malware.",

Even if you stick to \"safe-looking\" search links, you could still land on a fraudulent page.",
      "How hackers disguise fake apps as real ones",
      "So how do these fake sites end up in your search results in the first place? The attackers use a technique called SEO poisoning. They register lookalike domains, use plugins to game search algorithms and then climb up Google's rankings. That way, when you search for a trusted app, the fake site may appear as one of the first results.",
      "According to FortiGuard Labs, this particular campaign mainly targeted Chinese-speaking users, but the method is being used everywhere. In fact, earlier reports from Cisco Talos showed ransomware groups pushing fake downloads of AI tools like ChatGPT or InVideo. Others used spoofed sites for PayPal, Microsoft, Netflix and Apple. Sometimes, attackers even buy sponsored ads so that their malicious links appear right at the top.",
      "The scary part is that you might not even realize you installed something dangerous. Because the fake installer includes the real app, everything seems to work fine. Meanwhile, the hidden malware is already active on your device. That makes it harder to detect and much easier for attackers to steal your data.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the latest scam takes exploitation of a trusted platform to a new level. Instead of sending generic or suspicious-looking emails, attackers are now abusing Apple's iCloud Calendar invite system to deliver phishing content directly from Apple's own email servers.",
      "This clever tactic allows the fraudulent messages to bypass spam filters and appear more legitimate to unsuspecting users. The goal is to alarm you into calling a scammer's fake support number under the pretense of disputing a fraudulent PayPal transaction. Once contacted, you are manipulated into granting remote access to your devices or sharing sensitive data.",

      "Scammers exploit Apple\u2019s iCloud Calendar to deliver phishing invites that bypass spam filters. (Brent Lewin/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How the scam uses iCloud Calendar invites to bypass security",
      "The heart of this scam lies in abusing Apple's official infrastructure to lend credibility to a phishing attempt. Instead of using a suspicious or easily flagged email address, the attackers send calendar invites from Apple's genuine domain, noreply@email.apple.com, as reported by Bleeping Computer.",
      "The attacker embeds the phishing message in the \"Notes\" section of the calendar event, making it appear as a legitimate notification. They send the calendar invite to a Microsoft 365 email address they control, which is part of a mailing list. As a result, the invite is automatically forwarded to multiple real targets, broadening the scam\u2019s reach.",
      "Typically, when emails are forwarded, SPF (Sender Policy Framework) checks fail because the forwarding server isn't listed as an authorized sender. However, Microsoft 365 uses a technique called the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS), which rewrites the return path so that the message still passes SPF checks.",
      "This makes the email appear fully legitimate to both the recipient's inbox and automated spam filters. As a result, the message is far more likely to reach a user's inbox without being flagged, increasing the chance the victim will take the bait.",
      "SCAMMERS ARE USING DOCUSIGN EMAILS TO PUSH APPLE PAY FRAUD",
      "Cybercriminals leverage Microsoft 365 forwarding and Apple\u2019s email domain to outsmart filters. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Why these phishing scams are particularly dangerous",
      "What makes this campaign especially dangerous is the sense of legitimacy it conveys. Because Apple\u2019s official servers send the email directly, users are far less likely to suspect foul play. The message itself aims to panic the recipient by falsely claiming a large PayPal transaction occurred without the recipient's consent. The message includes a phone number to \"contact support\" and dispute the charge, but, in reality, it connects the victim to a scammer.",
      "Once the victim calls the number, the scammer poses as a technical support agent and attempts to convince the caller that the computer has been compromised. The next step is typically to ask the victim to download remote access software under the guise of issuing a refund or securing the account.",
      "In reality, this access is used to steal banking information, install malware or exfiltrate personal data. Because the original message passed security checks and seemed credible, victims often don't think twice before acting.",
      "DON\u2019T FALL FOR THIS BANK PHISHING SCAM TRICK",
      "Fraudsters are hijacking iCloud Calendar invites to trick users into calling fake support lines. (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from iCloud Calendar scammers",
      "I have listed some useful steps you can take to protect yourself from falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated phishing scams:",
      "If you receive an unexpected calendar invite, especially one containing a strange message or alarming claims, don't open it or respond. Legitimate companies rarely send payment disputes or security warnings through calendar invites. Always verify suspicious claims by logging into your official account directly.",
      "Phishing scams often include phone numbers that connect you to fraudsters posing as support agents. Instead of calling the number in the message, use official contact details found on the company's official website.",
      "Antivirus programs protect your computer from malware and phishing sites by blocking suspicious downloads and warning you about unsafe websites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Also, keeping your antivirus updated ensures it can defend against the latest threats.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Hackers are able to send you these phishing emails because they have your data. Using a personal data removal service helps scrub your personal information from data broker websites. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to gather details about you and craft convincing, targeted phishing attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A password manager helps you generate and securely store strong, unique passwords for every account. This reduces the risk of reusing weak passwords that scammers can easily exploit to gain unauthorized access to your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Scammers are taking phishing attacks in a disturbing new direction by manipulating trusted platforms to deliver malicious content. The safest approach is to treat any unexpected calendar invite, especially those with alarming messages or strange contact numbers, with extreme caution. Never call the number provided in the message or click on any links. Instead, go directly to official websites or your account's official dashboard to verify suspicious activity.",

      "FBI WARNS SENIORS ABOUT BILLION-DOLLAR SCAM DRAINING RETIREMENT FUNDS, EXPERT SAYS AI DRIVING IT",
      "1. The dog walker overpayment scam",
      "Bob from Harrison, Ohio, recently shared how he was nearly tricked by a scammer posing as a pet owner. The con began with a request for dog sitting. Bob was promised $250 for care and food, but then a fake check for $4,358 arrived.",
      "The scammer instructed Bob to send $4,000 of it to an \"appliance retailer.\" Why an appliance retailer when the service was for dog sitting? Scammers often use a third party to make the request sound more believable. If they simply asked for the money back, it would raise red flags. By inventing another company, whether a retailer, shipping service or contractor, they add urgency and legitimacy to the story. In reality, that \"retailer\" is just another front that the scammer controls. Here's the catch: the check appears to be real, but it's actually counterfeit. The bank may release the funds temporarily, but once it bounces, you're on the hook for the entire amount.",
      "Making a payment by scanning a QR code with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip: If you're asked to forward money to a third party, especially one unrelated to the original deal, treat it as a scam. Keep the check and envelope as evidence, and report it to the FTC and your state attorney general.",
      "2. The online marketplace scam",
      "Selling a couch, bike or electronics online? Some buyers \"accidentally\" send too much. They then ask you to return the difference through Zelle, Venmo or a wire transfer. Once the check or payment reverses, you've lost both the product and the money you returned.",

      "Scammers may try to recruit buyers into buying gift cards before a false check they provided bounces. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3. The mystery shopper scam",
      "You might get an email or letter offering a job as a mystery shopper. They send you a large check to \"test\" stores by buying gift cards. You're asked to send the gift card numbers back as proof of purchase. After the bank reverses the fake check, you've lost the money you spent on those gift cards.",
      "Tip: Real companies never pay upfront with extra funds or ask for gift card codes by email.",
      "4. The rental deposit scam",
      "Scammers target renters by mailing a check for more than the deposit or rent. They claim it was a mistake and ask you to refund the difference. The check later bounces, leaving you stuck.",
      "Tip: Only accept payments through secure online portals or in person with verified funds.",
      "5. The work-from-home equipment scam",

      "Tip: Legitimate employers provide equipment directly or reimburse verified expenses, not through overpayments.",

      "Scammers target remote workers by promising to provide a stipend for work-from-home tech. (iStock)",
      "How to protect yourself from overpayment scams",
      "Now that you've seen how these scams play out, from fake dog sitting gigs to marketplace frauds and bogus job offers, it's clear they all follow the same playbook. Someone sends you too much money and pressures you to forward the extra. That \"extra\" never existed, and once the check bounces, you're left holding the bag. The good news is, there are clear steps you can take to protect yourself and keep your money safe.",
      "Every scam in this article, from the dog walker hoax to rental deposit tricks, begins with an overpayment that looks harmless. If someone pays you more than you're owed, it's not a mistake. It's a scam. Do not respond or send money to any third party. Save the check and envelope as evidence, then report it.",
      "Scammers count on you trusting what you see in your account. In Bob's case, his $4,358 check looked real because the bank showed it as \"available.\" But available isn't the same as cleared. Always ask your bank to confirm when funds are fully verified before you spend a dime.",
      "Urgency is the scammer's strongest weapon. Marketplace fraudsters, renters and fake employers will pressure you to \"fix\" the mistake right away. Slow down, double-check and don't let anyone force you into quick action.",
      "Whether it's for rent, freelance work or selling a used item, scammers prefer paper checks because they're easy to fake. Stick with secure, traceable payment platforms or in-person verified funds. That way, you don't get stuck when a check bounces.",
      "If you receive a suspicious check, save everything: the envelope, emails, texts and any names used. In the dog sitting scam, Bob's saved emails and the scammer's phone number became valuable evidence. This documentation helps law enforcement and protects you if the scammer tries again under another identity.",
      "Scammers often find victims by scraping personal details from online data brokers. That's how they target renters, pet sitters or jobseekers. Using a personal data removal service can limit your exposure and make you harder to target in the first place. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many banks let you set fraud alerts for large deposits or unusual transactions. Turning these on gives you a chance to review suspicious activity before a scammer pressures you into acting on it.",
      "Just like Bob did when he cut contact with the fake pet owner, reporting scams helps protect others. File with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov and your state attorney general. You can also alert your local police and community groups to stop scammers from targeting someone else.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Overpayment scams prey on trust and urgency. They can pop up in online sales, job offers, rental agreements and even friendly community boards. By knowing the warning signs, you can stop scammers before they reach your wallet. Stay cautious whenever you're asked to deposit more than expected and forward the extra. If it sounds strange, it's probably a scam.",

      "If you've spent time in a camper van, you know what to expect. You trade a little comfort for a lot of freedom, squeeze into tight corners and make peace with the idea that personal space is secondary to mobility.",
      "But every once in a while, a new model rolls onto the scene that flips that thinking on its head. Meet the Robeta Ananya. This isn't just a van: it's a \"glamper\" on wheels, and it makes other builds look like tin cans.",

      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "A true living room, not just a chair",
      "Robeta makes it clear they really mean luxury. Instead of adding the typical swivel seat like most models, they built an actual, fully realized living room. There is a partition between the driving cab and the main cabin. The star of the show is an L-shaped couch that runs over six feet long. And it's not just any couch. It is deep, plush and inviting. It's the kind of seating where you can stretch out on without bumping into a dinette table or a cabinet corner.",
      "Robeta Mobil is offering a luxury camping experience via its newest camper model, available in 2026. (Robeta Mobil)",
      "Bedtime gets an upgrade",
      "When the sun goes down, that beautiful lounge transforms. A double bed lowers from the ceiling, turning the room into a proper bedroom without having to rearrange cushions or fold anything in a weird way. In the morning, it lifts right back up, making space for coffee and conversation. It is a smooth trick that makes the van feel more like a studio apartment than a rolling compromise. Neither the couch nor the bed needs to sacrifice comfort the way sofa beds typically do.",
      "Laundry on the road",
      "Let's talk about the washer and dryer. Yes, really. A compact Tiny Wash unit is built right into the wardrobe. It handles just enough for a quick refresh, and it actually dries, too. No more hanging socks from cabinet knobs or relying on campground and public laundromats. For extended trips, this little feature is a money saver and an absolute game changer.",
      "VOLKSWAGEN\u2019S ICONIC CUTE VAN DRIVES ITSELF WITH 360-DEGREE VISION",
      "Robeta Mobil says that its Ananya model will offer a luxury experience on the road. (Robeta Mobil)",
      "A kitchen you'll actually use",
      "Over in the kitchen, things continue to impress. You get a Corian countertop, a proper two-burner gas stove, a grill and oven combo, and a roomy 130-liter fridge and freezer. This setup is ready for real cooking, not just boiling water or reheating prepackaged meals. If you like to eat well on the road, this one is built with you in mind.",
      "A bathroom that feels like a bathroom",
      "At the rear of the van, the bathroom doesn't feel like an afterthought. It has a sink, a full-standing shower and a macerating toilet. Instead of cramming it all into a tiny box, Robeta gave it a soft curtain enclosure that keeps the look minimal and the space functional. It feels clean, intentional and refreshingly roomy.",
      "Power to keep you out there",
      "This luxury van even has the chops for off-roading. The Ananya packs a 10-kilowatt-hour EcoFlow power system with stackable batteries and 450 watts of solar. You can stay off the cord for days without blinking. Add in a 160-liter freshwater tank, diesel heat and hot water via Webasto, and the freedom to wander suddenly looks very comfortable. These amenities are remarkable for a camper van this size.",
      "Robeta Ananya price in the U.S. and how to buy one",
      "The Robeta Ananya is pure luxury on wheels, and its price reflects that. In the United States, the limited Founders' Edition starts at about $295,000. Only five of these exclusive models will be built, with deliveries starting in January 2026. If you want one, you'll need to act quickly. Robeta is taking U.S. orders directly through its website.",

      "What this means for you",
      "If you've been holding off on van life because you don't want to sacrifice comfort, the Robeta Ananya changes the game. It delivers a real living room, a full kitchen and a bathroom that feels like it belongs in a home. You can wash clothes on the road, sleep in a proper bed and stay powered up for days without plugging in. This means you can explore remote places without giving up the little luxuries that make travel enjoyable. In short, you get the freedom of the open road with the comfort of a high-end apartment.",
      "Stay connected while you roam",
      "When you're traveling in a camper van, nothing kills the vibe faster than losing cell service, especially if you rely on your phone for maps, music, work or keeping in touch. Thankfully, there are two handy solutions to keep you connected: cell phone boosters and mobile hotspots.",
      "Cell phone boosters amplify weak signals from nearby towers, making calls clearer, boosting data speeds and reducing dropped calls. They're ideal for rural drives, national parks or even just passing through patchy areas. Installation typically involves an outside antenna to capture the signal, an amplifier to boost it and an inside antenna to rebroadcast it inside your van.",
      "Mobile hotspots, on the other hand, turn a cellular signal into a private Wi-Fi network for your devices. They're perfect for working remotely from the road, streaming movies or sharing the internet with multiple passengers. Many can run off your phone plan or use a dedicated SIM card for more robust coverage.",
      "Pro tip:\u00a0If your adventures often take you far from towns or highways, a cell phone booster is your best bet for call reliability. If you need strong Wi-Fi for work or entertainment, pair it with a mobile hotspot for the ultimate on-the-road connectivity.",

With thoughtful design, smart use of space and luxury features, it invites you to travel farther and stay longer in comfort.

      "PROVO, Utah \u2013 Tyler Robinson's defense counsel requested another hearing to determine if they'll force prosecutors to present evidence and allow cross-examination before the case proceeds in the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk.",
      "During a court hearing on Monday, Utah County Chief District Attorney Chad Grunander said prosecutors have a \"voluminous\" amount of evidence in the case.",
      "\"There is a substantial amount of discovery in this case, Your Honor. It's voluminous, to say the least. And we're working on a process where we can exchange information as quickly as possible and be efficient in that process,\" Grunander said.",
      "Robinson's defense attorney, Kathryn Nester, asked the court if she could delay a decision on whether she wants to force an evidence hearing where the defense team would be able to cross-examine witnesses.",

      "Tyler Robinson appears virtually in Utah court on Sept. 16, 2025, to face charges in the assassination of Charlie Kirk. (Utah State Courts)",
      "\"\u2026until we can kind of get our heads around exactly what we're dealing with and how much we need to process it, it's going to be difficult for us to give you a reasonable expectation of when we will be ready to do the [preliminary hearing],\" she said.",

      "Kathryn Nester arrives to Utah County District Court in Provo, Utah on Monday, September 29, 2025. Nester is representing Tyler Robinson, the suspect in the assassination of Charlie Kirk. (Alec Thornock for Fox News Digital)",
      "\"The goal for his new high-profile defense attorneys in the Tyler Robinson case is going to be keep him off of death row,\" said Maryland attorney and legal analyst Randolph Rice, who is following the case. \"And that's probably their goal right now, or at least that's what they're thinking about.\"",
      "One option would be to seek a plea deal that spares Robinson from the potential death penalty, like Bryan Kohberger's defense in the Idaho student murders. That could be months or even years down the line.",
      "If the case does go to trial, prosecutors will have to prove that Kirk's murder included aggravating factors that warrant execution if the suspect is found guilty.",
      "\"What the defense may be able to argue is to say, this was a single sniper bullet that had a single intended target \u2014 and therefore it posed no other danger to anyone else,\" Rice told Fox News Digital. \"And if they can prove that to a jury or they can convince a jury of that, then they won't get the aggravating murder, and therefore they won't have the death penalty on the table.\"",
      "Robinson, like all criminal defendants in the U.S., is considered innocent until proven guilty. But prosecutors are expected to unveil a mountain of evidence in court, and the politically charged case is being closely watched around the country.",
      "Salt Lake City-based criminal defense attorney Skye Lazaro told Fox News Digital it's \"not common\" for state courts to waive a defendant's appearance, but it's something attorneys can request.",
      "Lazaro said she's not surprised such a request was granted, but said she'd think the judge in Robinson's case would want to get an affirmative waiver from Robinson himself.",
      "Robinson is still being held within a special housing unit at the Utah County Jail, Sgt. Raymond Ormond told Fox News Digital.

Robinson allegedly told his roommate and romantic partner that he did it because he \"had enough of [Kirk's] hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out.\"",
      "The partner, who was identified as trans, is cooperating with investigators.",
      "\"Obviously they've got the concern about defending their client, they've got concerns about the media attention, but I also think that they may have concerns about their personal safety,\" Rice said. \"This certainly is a political assassination. It's something that has been in the headlines. There are a lot of individuals who are emotional about this. And certainly people on the left are certainly emotional about it. People on the right are certainly emotional about it. And so there are concerns from the defense team's perspective. About their personal safety and that's something they're going to have to consider throughout this entire trial.\"",

According to a probable cause affidavit, he had \"confessed...or implied\" guilt to a close family friend. The Washington County Sheriff's Office later said his parents convinced him to surrender peacefully rather than take his own life.",
      "Police recovered a rifle at the scene that investigators allege had Robinson's DNA on it. They also have surveillance video on the campus and nearby roads and a footprint on the rooftop where a sniper fired the bullet that killed Kirk.",
      "According to court documents, the suspect used his phone on school grounds at least once, on video. That could provide police with additional evidence. They also identified a suspect vehicle, a gray Dodge Challenger, like the one Robinson drives.",

      "And as Fox News Digital reported Thursday, an officer guarding the campus perimeter \"made contact\" with Robinson near where police recovered the suspected murder weapon as he was allegedly texting his roommate about wanting to retrieve it before skipping town, according to law enforcement sources.",
      "Defending a death penalty case will require Robinson's legal team to hire forensic specialists, mental health evaluators and jury consultants, among other measures, Rice said, but his lawyers may have to fight for funding or risk being \"hamstrung\" before the case goes to trial.",
      "Kirk's family may also weigh in before prosecutors decide to offer a plea deal. His widow, Erika Kirk, said during her husband's memorial service Sunday said she has already forgiven Robinson \"because it was what Christ did, and it's what Charlie would do.\"",
      "Separately, she said she did not want to get involved in the decision to seek capital punishment in an interview with the New York Times.",
      "\"I\u2019ll be honest,\" she told the paper. \"I told our lawyer, I want the government to decide this. I do not want that man\u2019s blood on my ledger. Because when I get to heaven, and Jesus is like: \u2018Uh, eye for an eye? Is that how we do it?\u2019 And that keeps me from being in heaven, from being with Charlie?\"",

      "If prosecutors decide to offer a plea deal, it may not look like the recent plea for Bryan Kohberger in the Idaho student murders case, according to Louis Gelormino, a Staten Island defense attorney who is following the case.",
      "\"One of the things that surprised me out there in Kohberger was they didn\u2019t let him allocute to the crimes,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Usually, when you take a plea, you have to confess to your crimes. I would imagine here, if they do take that off the table and they do get a plea out of him, that he\u2019ll have to allocute and explain his crime in public.\"",
      "He said he expects Robinson's team to explore a potential insanity defense, but his alleged escape from Orem and week spent plotting the crime could complicate that argument. He also expects defense attorneys to challenge as much evidence as possible in case prosecutors or police failed to \"cross all their Ts and dot all their Is,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Expert analyst Bill Roggio explains why China&apos;s growing influence with the Taliban makes President Donald Trump&apos;s plan to retake Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan unlikely to succeed.",
    "story": [
      "Senior Fellow Foundation for Defense of Democracies Bill Roggio says that China and the Taliban will never allow the US to retake Bagram Airbase despite comments from President Donald Trump",
      "President Donald Trump made the shocking announcement this month that the U.S. is \"trying\" to take back Bagram Airfield from the Taliban in Afghanistan after abandoning it more than four years ago.",
      "There\u2019s just one problem with Trump\u2019s latest ambition \u2014 China will see to it that Washington does not accomplish this goal, warned Bill Roggio, expert analyst and senior editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 \"Long War Journal.\"",
      "\"First of all, the Taliban will never accept the return to the US. I'd sooner\u2026believe the Taliban would give up on its Sharia or Islamic law before I\u2019d believe that it would let the U.S. return,\" Roggio told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"But let's say the Trump administration could convince the Taliban to consider allowing the U.S. to return to Bagram,\" he continued. \"The Chinese would come down hard.\"",

      "Roggio explained that China and Russia have a vested interest in the U.S. staying out of the region.",
      "The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan opened the mineral-rich nation to China and has enabled Beijing to expand its Belt and Road Initiative into a country \u2014 though run by a terrorist organization \u2014 that it was previously unable to tap.",
      "China \u2014 the first country to appoint an ambassador to the Taliban-run nation in 2023 \u2014 sent its foreign minister, Wang Yi, in August to Kabul to hold talks with Afghanistan's acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.",
      "According to the Taliban, China expressed an interest not only in Afghanistan\u2019s mining opportunities, where minerals like lithium, copper, iron, gold and uranium are abundant, but Beijing also said it was open to expand trade with Kabul.",

      "While access to these minerals could greatly benefit China, the impact that trade and mining agreements with Beijing could have on Afghanistan\u2019s dire economy may prove crucial for Kabul.",
      "\"The Chinese just wield significant influence with the Taliban, particularly when it comes to something like the U.S. return,\" Roggio said. \"They would pressure the Taliban by possibly canceling those mining rights, by restricting trade, by ending political and diplomatic recognition. These are all things that are important to the Taliban as they try to develop as a government and try to become legitimately recognized.\"",

      "\"The Taliban don't care if the U.S. recognizes them as much as the Taliban would care if the Chinese would recognize them, if the Russians would recognize them,\" he added.",
      "Trump claimed that the deal he formed with the Taliban in 2020 in Doha, Qatar \u2014 which outlined the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan by May 2021 \u2014 did not include the Bagram Air Base.",
      "\"We were going to keep it,\" Trump told reporters from the U.K. last week.",
      "But the original deal did not include a stipulation allowing the U.S. to maintain forces at the base about 30 miles north of Kabul.",

      "Trump also said a major reason he wants to get the base back is because it's \"an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.\" But when asked which facility he was referring to, neither the White House nor the Pentagon would confirm, and Fox News Digital could not locate a Chinese nuclear facility through open-source intelligence that close to Afghanistan\u2019s border.",
      "Regardless of whether there is a Chinese nuclear facility near the former American base in Afghanistan, Roggio warned that the economic ties Beijing and Kabul are establishing is \"dangerous.\"",
      "\"The growing Taliban-Chinese relationship is something we should worry about. The Chinese can give the Taliban access to technology \u2014 military technology,\" he said. \"They could give them the resources that they need.\"",
      "Roggio pointed out that a mining deal could put \"billions\" into the Taliban\u2019s pockets.",
      "\"Why is this important? Because al Qaeda and other terrorist groups are using Afghanistan as a base of operations,\" Roggio said, noting that al Qaeda is reported to be running training camps in 13 out of the nation\u2019s 34 provinces.",

      "'The Dave Rubin Show' host Dave Rubin discusses speculation surrounding President Donald Trump and Elon Musk at Charlie Kirk's memorial service on 'America Reports.'",
      "Elon Musk has once again entered the British political fray, this time promoting a new right-wing party, Advance UK, while criticizing the leader of the rapidly growing and influential Reform UK party, Nigel Farage.",
      "Musk recently posted on X: Go with @_AdvanceUK, Ben [Habib] and Tommy [Robinson] for the real change that\u2019s needed to save Britain!\" In another post, he said, \"Advance UK will actually drive change. Farage is weak sauce who will do nothing.\"",
      "Earlier this month, he addressed tens of thousands in London at the \"Unite the Kingdom\" rally organized by the controversial right-winger Tommy Robinson. The billionaire joined the march by video link and condemned the left as \"the party of murder.\"",
      "NIGEL FARAGE RESPONDS AFTER ELON MUSK DECLARES HE 'DOESN'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES' TO LEAD REFORM UK PARTY",
      "The billionaire also took aim at the man who could be Britain's next prime minister and claimed Nigel Farage \"doesn\u2019t have what it takes.\" That was before the birth of Advance UK. More recently, he said, \"There needs to be massive government reform in Britain and the people need to be in charge, not some bureaucracy that doesn\u2019t care.\"",
      "The right-leaning party, which is close to officially registering, is led by Ben Habib, a former co-deputy chairman of Reform UK. \"The two-party system is dead,\" Habib said. \"The Conservatives and Labour Party have had their chance, and now the people want something new.\"",
      "\"You clearly don\u2019t have a two-party system,\" said Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society think tank. However, he asked: \"Will this system produce a majority government and whether, for example, at the end of the process it delivers a main opposition party.\"",
      "Part of the fragmentation of British politics is the widespread disgust of political leaders. Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage all received unfavorable views between 52% and 68%, according to data from polling organization YouGov.",

      "Despite the negative view of Farage, Reform UK leads in the polls in the event of a general election, according to the polling company Ipsos. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Reform will win at the next election.",
      "\"If there was an election tomorrow, then it would likely win,\" Mendoza says. However, we don\u2019t know when the next election will be, which makes it near impossible to predict at this stage, he says. \"The golden law of British politics is you can\u2019t predict the vote that far ahead.\"",
      "BRACE FOR A 'POLITICAL REVOLUTION' IN EUROPE, UK'S NIGEL FARAGE SAYS AFTER VANCE'S SPEECH IN MUNICH",
      "When asked why Advance UK is needed when Farage's party is far ahead in the polls, Habib said, \"Reform will not deliver. It stands for nothing. It is a populist party without a political philosophy and without intellectual heft or capability,\" Habib said, claiming \"Farage has a patriotic persona, but he is nothing more than a political expedient. He would be worse than [former Prime Minister] Boris Johnson.\"",
      "Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t look like Advance U.K. will split the vote with Reform. According to Mendoza, bringing Robinson into the party may have been a mistake. During the recent rally, some protestors allegedly attacked police officers. \"Most people will not like violence at a political rally,\" he said. \"And they won\u2019t support the party.\"",
      "One of the leading frustrations voters have at the moment is that neither the current government nor the last one has managed to stop the surge of legal and illegal immigration. In fact, it has worsened. Almost 50,000 undocumented immigrants, many seeking asylum, arrived in Britain in the 12 months through June. That\u2019s up from around 39,000 at the same time the previous year, according to government data.",
      "On Saturday, the Daily Telegraph reported that migrants now account for 98% of the latest rise in population. According to the Office for National Statistics, the Telegraph reported, 69.3 million people were estimated to be living in the country in mid-2024, up 755,254 from the same time in 2023.",

      "\"We need a holistic solution to reduce immigration,\" Habib said. He also said borders must be enforced and illegal migrants deported. Worse still, those asylum-seekers are living in hotels at taxpayers\u2019 expense of \u00a35.8 million a day ($7.4 million).",

      "Earlier this summer, protests over asylum hotels erupted in Epping, southeast England. Separately, Farage suspended one of his local councilors over accusations of racism during the demonstration.",
      "Elon Musk responded to Farage's suspending the council member on X. He wrote: \"Farage is weak, runny sauce. He won\u2019t let Reform even stand up for their own people, e.g. punishing their Epping member, and he will change nothing of significance politically.\"",

Earlier this year, Irish comedian Graham Linehan was met by armed police at Heathrow Airport after making online comments about transgender people. Such incidents appear to be fast becoming the norm.",
      "Yet despite Musk's criticism, a new opinion poll released on Friday in the U.K. by YouGov showed Farage's Reform UK on target to deliver a massive defeat of Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his ruling Labour Party if an election were to be held.",

      "With Republican and Democratic leadership at an impasse over the extension of health insurance subsidies, the U.S. government could temporarily cease operations at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday unless a deal is struck.",
      "Government shutdowns put hundreds of thousands of \u201cnonessential\u201d federal workers on furlough, meaning they are forced to take a leave of absence without pay, while other \u201cessential\u201d workers will be required to show up to work without getting paid either. Often, such shutdowns lead to the closure of national parks and museums, fewer health inspections, slower services for veterans, longer wait times on Social Security phone lines and more.",
      "While the government plays a big part in the economy, history shows that the lasting effects of shutdowns are limited.",
      "Economic growth can be dented, but slightly and temporarily, with an array of estimates from Wall Street as well as the Congressional Budget Office finding that even the longest shutdown ever \u2014 35 days in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 shaved only as much as 0.4% from total economic output.",
      "The full impact will likely depend on how many workers are furloughed or fired. In the 2013 government shutdown, 40% of all civilian employees were furloughed. If a similar number of workers are furloughed during this shutdown, U.S. economic growth could be slowed by about 0.15% per week.",
      "In a break from previous shutdowns, the president and his administration have threatened not just furloughs, but permanent job cuts in the event the government comes to a halt.",
      "This shutdown comes at a particularly perilous time for the U.S. economy. Inflation has been rising every month since April, and the labor market is weakening at what appears to be a rapid pace.",
      "In early September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the U.S. economy created 911,000 fewer jobs than previously thought. That came on the heels of a jobs report days earlier that showed the economy added just 22,000 jobs in August.",

      "The last major shutdown in 2018-2019 is the outlier. The S&P 500 posted a more than 10% rise during that shutdown, but there was a major sell-off ahead of that impasse due to other factors, such as fears about declining corporate earnings and the Fed raising rates.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 On the brink of a shutdown, the top two Democratic leaders met with President Donald Trump in the White House on Monday and urged him to agree to extend Obamacare subsidies that expire at the end of the year in a bill to keep the government open.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said they had to explain the imminent consequences of inaction to Trump. People who get health insurance through Obamacare will begin getting notices in the coming days warning that their premiums will soon go up unless Congress extends the funds.",
      "\u201cHe was not aware that Americans would pay \u2014 so many Americans, tens of millions of Americans \u2014 would pay huge increases in their health care bills,\u201d Schumer told reporters. \u201cAnd he was not aware that the real effect of that starts Oct. 1st, not Dec. 31st. So it seemed from his body language and some of the things he said that he was not aware of the ramifications.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe told the president he can solve the problem\u201d by telling Republican leaders to \u201cjust take our provision\u201d to extend the subsidies for Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and \u201cput it in their bill,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "It has become the central demand of Democrats in exchange for their votes to fund the government, which will shut down Tuesday at midnight unless there is a deal.",
      "Ironically, it could also improve the GOP\u2019s prospects in the 2026 midterm elections if Republicans agree to extend the subsidies, according to some Republican pollsters. If health insurance premiums soar next year, these pollsters note, angry voters would tend to blame the party in power.",
      "GOP pollster John McLaughlin made the case for extending the Obamacare funds in a recent opinion piece titled \u201cA Health Care Tax Hike Poses the Greatest Midterm Threat to the GOP.\u201d",
      "\u201cHaving worked with President Trump for over a decade to transform the Republican Party from a party of country club losers to a winning majority party of working middle-class Americans, these are our MAGA voters who need this tax credit,\u201d McLaughlin wrote. \u201cWorking middle-class Americans need affordable health care.\u201d",
      "Still, GOP leaders are adamant that they won\u2019t allow it in this bill.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a purely hostage-taking exercise on part of the Democrats,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said after Monday's meeting at the White House. \"We are willing to sit down and work with them on some of the issues they want to talk about, whether it\u2019s extension of premium tax credits with reforms \u2014 we\u2019re happy to have that conversation. But as of right now, this is a hijacking of the American people.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, Republicans are discussing ways to structure an extension of the enhanced subsidies \u2014 but with changes that would lower the current annual projected cost of $35 billion and have wider appeal in the party. But that would be as a separate bill, not attached to the short-term funding measure.",
      "Republican ideas include winding the subsidies down after a few years, establishing new income-based limits for eligibility and beefing up restrictions on Obamacare money\u2019s going to insurers who cover abortion.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said it\u2019s important that everyone is \u201cpaying a little bit\u201d for their health insurance coverage. He said the enhanced subsidies should wind down over three years, rather than continue permanently.",
      "But he insisted that Congress can\u2019t just let the funds end, because people who lose coverage would have no alternative.",
      "\u201cThis is the only game in town for them, is Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rest of the individual market has been destroyed.\u201d",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who is close to Trump, said he believes his party is \"going to put together, hopefully, a working group to fix the ACA.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe ACA fight continues. There are plenty of Republicans who would like to find some common ground,\u201d Graham told NBC News on Monday.",
      "Asked whether Trump is one of them, Graham replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cI think so. I mean, once you understand the effect in November, I think a lot of Republicans want to find common ground.\u201d",
      "In addition, abortion foes like SBA Pro-Life America have been lobbying Republicans not to extend the Obamacare funds unless they are paired with additional restrictions on money going to insurance companies that cover abortion, two sources said.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s important to our side,\u201d he said.",

They have backup from a coalition of more than 30 conservative groups, who wrote a letter Friday telling Trump the money was a Covid-era subsidy that was \u201calways supposed to be temporary.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic operatives are already making plans to slam Republicans in the 2026 elections if they refuse to extend Obamacare tax credits set to expire at the end of this year.",
      "\u201cRepublicans continue to attack affordable health care by refusing to fund ACA subsidies,\u201d said CJ Warnke, a spokesman for the Democratic super-PAC House Majority PAC. \u201cIn 2026, we plan to ensure vulnerable House Republicans are held accountable with ads attacking them for defunding health care while rewarding the elite with massive tax breaks.\u201d",
      "In the strange world of Obamacare politics, some Democrats say the GOP is effectively rejecting an offer that would save Republicans from political harm.",
      "\u201cThe GOP position is the political equivalent of breaking their own leg and then putting a blockade up to stop the ambulance,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a longtime Democratic strategist and former senior Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee aide.",
      "A Republican strategist working on 2026 races said the party is torn on the issue and that it will defer to candidates to decide what\u2019s best for their districts.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not advising any member to take a stance on it,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cWe know there\u2019s going to be numerous Republicans on opposing sides of this issue.\u201d",
      "It is \u201cpolitically a good thing\u201d for swing district members like Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., who has backed a one-year extension, to take that stance, the Republican strategist added. \u201cBut for hard-line conservatives, it\u2019s going to be a tough thing.\u201d",
      "Some progressive advocates say the political danger for Republicans is the reason Democrats should demand even more than a continuation of ACA funding in a bill to prevent a shutdown.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why front-line Republicans are pushing for a short-term extension \u2014 so they can get through the midterms and then let them expire,\u201d said Ezra Levin, a co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible. \u201cI\u2019d view a one- or two-year extension as more or less the Republican position.\u201d",
      "He said Democrats should insist on \u201ca permanent extension\u201d of the ACA money, as well as restoration of Trump\u2019s Medicaid cuts and protections against the administration\u2019s using \u201crescissions\u201d to avoid spending money that has been directed by Congress."

      "AOL\u2019s dial-up internet service is shutting down Tuesday, ending one of the web\u2019s first mainstream access points.",
      "Once a dominant technology player, AOL, initially called America Online, provided the gateway for millions of people to get their first taste of the web. Signing into the service \u2014 a process accompanied by a noisy, garbled series of computerized tones that sounded like a drowning robot \u2014 became a rite of passage.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Doctors with troubled pasts are performing complicated cosmetic surgery procedures tied to crippling pain and injury, patients allege.",
    "story": [
      "Not long after California surgeon Andrew S. Hsu landed a job with a cosmetic surgery chain in Georgia, several of his patients alleged they suffered disfiguring injuries, and even his new employer allegedly had doubts about his competence, court records show.",
      "Hsu, a board-certified general surgeon, was one of six out-of-state doctors who joined the Atlanta Goals Aesthetics & Plastic Surgery center during the pandemic. The surgeons received temporary licenses to practice in Georgia, which state officials granted in response to the sudden need for more medical personnel to address the Covid outbreak \u2014 even though the center specialized in elective cosmetic surgeries, such as Brazilian butt lifts, or BBLs, and liposuction, paid for in cash or on credit.",
      "The Atlanta center announced its opening in March 2021 as an expansion of New York-based Goals Aesthetics & Plastic Surgery, which markets \u201cprecision body contouring\u201d for about a dozen surgery clinics in eight states, promising patients a \u201cdream body in just one visit.\u201d",
      "But the Atlanta center\u2019s early days were marred by allegations of substandard patient care. Court records show that at least 20 women filed medical malpractice lawsuits, several of which were later dismissed,  against the facility, or its owner and surgeons. Hsu was named as a defendant in seven suits filed against the Atlanta center, more than any other physician there. An eighth patient sued Hsu alleging negligence in an operation he performed at a Goals office in New York.",
      "Hsu did not respond to requests for comment. Goals declined to comment. Both have denied any negligence in response to the lawsuits.",
      "Cosmetic surgery chains across the country are attracting patients by promising \u201cminimally invasive\u201d operations to reshape their bodies or get rid of stubborn fat \u2014 even helping arrange outside financing for people who can\u2019t pay upfront. Hundreds of thousands of patients are undergoing such procedures each year, and plastic surgeons can earn more than $500,000 each year in one of the highest-paid specialties in American medicine.",
      "An investigation by KFF Health News found that lawsuits filed by injured patients have trailed the industry\u2019s growth, in some cases alleging that surgeons lacked adequate training, had histories of malpractice lawsuits or had faced disciplinary action by state medical licensing boards \u2014 yet crossed into another state and kept practicing.",
      "In the Atlanta lawsuits, Goals has denied any negligence and won dismissal of several of them because patients had signed papers agreeing to outside arbitration \u2014 which requires them to resolve disputes privately and outside the court system.",
      "Yet, Goals argued in a separate contract dispute with a medical staffing firm that several of its Atlanta surgeons, including Hsu, were indeed prone to problems \u2014 either because they lacked adequate training or had troubled pasts, including investigations by state medical licensing boards into misconduct, court records show. One of Hsu\u2019s Atlanta patients alleged in a separate lawsuit that she suffered in pain for more than a year because a piece of a scalpel was left inside her body after a BBL and liposuction.",
      "In a June 2023 court filing in that contract dispute,  Goals blamed the problems on a medical staffing firm \u2014 Barton Associates, a private equity-owned firm in Massachusetts \u2014 it said failed to do adequate background checks on the doctors it supplied. Barton denied the allegations and said it met all terms of the contract.",
      "No public database exists to help patients learn the full practice histories of physicians, including cosmetic surgeons. And patients are largely left on their own to decipher which certificates  hanging on a surgeon\u2019s office wall, or ballyhooed in web advertising, signify appropriate training and which do not. Disputes among medical specialty groups over whose members are the best qualified to perform cosmetic operations \u2014 and deliver the best results \u2014 add to the confusion.",
      "No government agency tracks injuries or other complication rates at clinics offering cosmetic surgery or any other type of operations. And in many jurisdictions, including Georgia, gaining access to court records \u2014 a possible red flag for spotting problems \u2014 is laborious and costly.",
      "Charleetra Hornes, 52, who lives in the Atlanta suburbs and is suing the Goals center for medical malpractice, said she knew nothing of its alleged early troubles and chose the company because its advertising promised \u201cminimal downtime\u201d for recovery and that she would remain awake during the operation.",
      "She said she paid $6,650 for a \u201cdouble BBL\u201d in which fat is suctioned from the stomach, purified and injected into the buttocks and hips to create what Goals calls a \u201cnatural-looking enhancement.\u201d",
      "Goals went ahead with her surgery July 2, 2022, even though she had tested positive for Covid that day, according to the suit. Hornes alleged that two days before the surgery, Goals assigned her to surgeon Thomas Shannon, who has worked for Goals in Georgia and Texas.",
      "Though staff gave her pills to manage the discomfort, Hornes said, she suffered \u201cexcruciating pain\u201d during the procedure, according to the suit.",
      "That night, she spiked a fever that sent her to the emergency room. She spent two weeks in the hospital recovering from injuries, including a \u201csevere burn on her side,\u201d according to the suit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been disfigured and burned up, and it\u2019s not fair,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "In June 2024, Hornes sued Shannon, the Goals center and Barton Associates, alleging malpractice. On Sept. 2, a Georgia judge dismissed Shannon from the case, ruling that Hornes failed to serve him with the complaint in Texas before the statute of limitations ran out. He did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a separate order issued on the same day, the judge also dismissed the other defendants, citing the statute of limitations issue and that Hornes had previously signed an arbitration agreement. Some cosmetic surgery chains and other medical practices ask patients to sign such agreements.",
      "Hornes wishes she had learned more about the Atlanta surgery center, instead of accepting what she calls its \u201cflashy\u201d come-ons. \u201cI wish I would have taken it more seriously,\u201d she said in an interview, \u201cbecause it was life-altering.\u201d",
      "Malpractice cases and settlements are useful tools",
      "KFF Health News identified more than 200 lawsuits filed against multistate cosmetic surgery companies, mostly over the past seven years, including cases involving a dozen deaths, using databases of court records.",
      "Lawsuits by themselves don\u2019t prove wrongdoing. Many cases are settled under confidential terms that keep critical details under wraps. Yet, medical authorities and most physician licensing boards regard malpractice cases and settlements as a useful tool for detecting possible patterns of substandard health care that may harm patients.",
      "Court files show that surgeons who were sued numerous times for malpractice \u2014 and in some cases disciplined by state medical boards for misconduct \u2014 have managed to get hired by cosmetic surgery chains.",
      "Goals, owned by physician Sergey Voskin, has contracted with eight surgeons with three or more malpractice cases filed against them, including in the Atlanta area, court records allege. Gerald Hickson, founding director of the Vanderbilt Center for Patient and Professional Advocacy and an expert on medical malpractice issues, called that number of suits a \u201cwarning\u201d of possible problems, despite their outcome.",
      "Earlier this year, a Pennsylvania woman identified in court filings as \u201cP.C.\u201d sued Goals, Voskin and surgeon Peter Driscoll, alleging Driscoll came on board despite an \u201cextensive history of malpractice allegations, licensing suspensions and discipline\u201d in Texas and California, according to medical board records cited in the suit. Companies hiring doctors have ready access to the nonpublic National Practitioner Data Bank, which details disciplinary problems in a doctor\u2019s past. But it\u2019s not clear from court records whether anybody made these standard background checks.  Goals did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The suit also accuses Goals of consumer fraud for touting its surgeons as \u201cdouble if not triple board certified plastic surgeons.\u201d According to the complaint, Driscoll was board-certified by the American Board of Otolaryngology, a specialty that focuses on treatment and surgery of head and neck areas. Driscoll is no longer certified in the specialty, according to the American Board of Medical Specialties website.",
      "The woman alleges that Driscoll sexually harassed her and made \u201cunwanted and unwelcome sexual contact\u201d during a BBL procedure in June 2022 at a Goals office in New Jersey.",
      "According to the suit, staff members overheard Driscoll watching pornography in an office bathroom multiple times, but Goals did not terminate him at the time. New Jersey\u2019s State Board of Medical Examiners temporarily suspended Driscoll\u2019s license in February 2023 related to the incident, and the woman\u2019s lawsuit is pending in federal court in New Jersey. Goals and Voskin have denied the allegations in the suit and filed a motion to dismiss or compel arbitration of the case. Driscoll, who has not filed a response with the court, could not be reached for comment.",
      "Performance issues not \u2018disqualifying\u2019",
      "Other cosmetic surgery chains have faced multiple malpractice actions targeting surgeons or other health care providers who staff their clinics, court records show.",
      "The surgeon roster at Mia Aesthetics, a Miami-based chain that operates 13 cosmetic surgery offices nationwide, lists four doctors with three or more malpractice actions since 2020, court records show.",
      "Nearly a dozen injured patients have filed lawsuits criticizing the credentials of doctors and nurse practitioners affiliated with Belle Medical, including the family of a 70-year-old Utah woman with five children who died in the car two days after liposuction as her husband rushed her from home to a hospital, according to court records.",
      "Her husband alleges he called Belle Medical\u2019s office the day after the procedure to say his wife was having difficulty breathing and heart palpitations and couldn\u2019t walk more than a short distance, which the lawsuit argued were \u201ctextbook symptoms of pulmonary embolism, or blood clot in the lung.\u201d According to the suit, nobody at Belle Medical advised the family to seek immediate medical care. An autopsy found she died from \u201cbilateral pulmonary emboli,\u201d according to the suit.",
      "Backed by Peterson Partners, a Utah private equity and investment firm, Belle Medical operates in Utah, Idaho and Oklahoma, offering liposuction and other cosmetic surgery. Neither Belle Medical nor Peterson Partners responded to requests for comment. In court filings, Belle Medical has argued that its medical providers are independent contractors who are solely responsible for any procedures they perform.",
      "Private equity-backed Sono Bello, the largest of the cosmetic surgery chains with more than 100 locations nationwide, has defended more than a dozen lawsuits alleging the company contracted with inadequately trained doctors or practitioners previously disciplined by medical licensing boards. In May 2023, Ohio\u2019s medical board revoked the license of a Sono Bello contract surgeon after three of her patients died, two of them following procedures at a Sono Bello office in the Cleveland area, according to medical board records.",
      "Robert Centeno, Sono Bello\u2019s medical director for the East region, told KFF Health News that many surgeons have past performance issues, which he called \u201cnot, in fact, disqualifying.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of our colleagues are extremely professional and committed to their profession,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAnd while there may be a momentary lapse or issue with their practice, most of our surgeons take those sanctions, take that counseling, that advice, and improve their practices and go on to be very, very productive members of the medical community.\u201d",
      "Asked about malpractice lawsuits filed against the company, Centeno said that Sono Bello has \u201cperformed over 300,000 procedures to date,\u201d which he described as \u201cmore procedures for more patients completed safely than anyone else in the industry. It would be natural and understandable to know that at some point during that process, that a patient has actually sued us,\u201d Centeno said.",
      "\u2018Unable to perform\u2019",
      "In early 2020, as the pandemic slowed business in New York City, Goals sought to expand to Atlanta \u2014 a hot market for its BBLs. In a PR Newswire release, Goals promised patients \u201camazing contours\u201d and boasted of having \u201csome of the most experienced, and aesthetically forward surgeons in the industry.\u201d BBLs and liposuction make up 95% of its business, marketed to mostly Black and Hispanic women, Goals owner Voskin testified in a deposition filed this year in the Driscoll case. Many Atlanta patients suing the company paid roughly $6,000 to $8,000 for their surgeries, court records show.",
      "Goals initially staffed the Atlanta center through Barton Associates. Many hospitals and medical offices rely on such firms to find temporary doctors and other staff. Under the deal, Barton charged Goals $1,400 for each procedure and paid about $600 of that to the surgeon, according to Goals\u2019 court filings."

      "Lily finds herself surrounded by privilege at Harvard and, as she tries to find her place, she becomes drawn to a charming Indian-British student. Meanwhile, Lily\u2019s path toward self-discovery leads her to the past of her mother, who fled Cuba during the Revolution. A mystery then starts to unravel around the secrets she kept.",
      "Radford incorporated parts of her own life into \u201cNow Then\u201d through her experiences as a public high school graduate and a Harvard student from North Carolina. These aspects of her life inspired questions about access and privilege, Radford tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cMy father was the first in his family to go to college, his own family migrating from Jamaica and Cuba a generation prior,\u201d Radford says. \u201cMy grandfather often worked two and three jobs at the same time \u2014 working on the railroads while driving a garbage truck to support his family.",
      "\u201cThe idea that just two generations later I would have the type of exposure and adventure that my grandparents \u2014 and great-grandparents \u2014 could only dream of, set me on a path to discovery \u2014 and literary creativity! \u2014 that I am profoundly grateful for.\u201d",
      "Radford calls her creative process \u201ca labor of love and research.\u201d She says she read documents sent from relatives across three countries and interviewed family members who shared their stories, some for the first time.",
      "\u201cMy dad\u2019s family left Cuba in 1927, and they were Black immigrants. Their experience with race and belonging was incredibly textured,\u201d Radford says. \u201cExamining their history more closely gave me a nuanced appreciation for the context and environment in which they found themselves.\u201d",
      "Unpacking her family\u2019s past through a fictional story kept her focused on \u201cthe why,\u201d she says. \u201cIt allows me to lean into the meaning of an act or decision, instead of just the outcome.\u201d",

These initial two weeks following orientation were called \u201cShopping Period.\u201d We got to sample classes without commitment \u2014 no strings, no grades \u2014 just the freedom to learn.",
      "It was one of the many perks I\u2019d discovered in the crash course on privilege since I\u2019d arrived: rarely did the bounds of commitment or the burden of duty apply to this world of the elite. They always kept their freedom to choose. In fact, there seemed to be an entire series of \u201coff menu\u201d items in their universe, items that the rest of us plebeians never even knew existed.",

I\u2019m concentrating in Social Studies, which is just a fancy way of saying I\u2019m paying too much for a degree that my parents still refuse to tell their friends about. They think I\u2019m studying fourth grade geography.\u201d",
      "A ripple of laughter.",

      "After exercises in introductory phrases and a refresher in present tense verb conjugations, a soft timer beside the professor\u2019s desk buzzed, signaling the conclusion of our first class. I gathered my backpack while the students around me thrust loose pages into overstuffed binders.",
      "Just as I was leaving, I heard a voice over my shoulder.",

    "story": [
      "Tina Turner's fans seem to agree that a new statue of the late music legend is simply not the best.",
      "The 10-foot-tall bronze statue was unveiled Sept. 27 during the annual Tina Turner Heritage Days celebration in Turner's hometown of rural Brownsville, Tennessee. It depicts the \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" singer, who died in May 2023 at age 83, performing in a mini-skirt and heels while holding a microphone.",
      "Fred Ajanogha, the Atlanta-based sculptor who created the statue, reportedly paid extra attention to capturing the essence of Turner's hair, which he compared to the \u201cmane of a lion,\" according to the AP.",
      "But after the Brownsville Haywood County Chamber of Commerce shared a video on Facebook showing the moment the statue was uncovered near a museum honoring Turner at the West Tennessee Delta Heritage Center, fans began expressing disappointment.",
      "\"That statue should have been kicked down after the unveiling. That is a very poor replica of what is supposed to be The Iconic Tina Turner. So Disrespectful!\" one wrote beneath the video while another fan said whoever paid for the statue should \"get their money back.\"",
      "The statue also met with criticism on X, with one disappointed Turner fan calling it a \"tragedy,\" and writing, \"She deserves better.\"",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the Tina Turner statue is hilarious. I can\u2019t look at it without laughing. And that\u2019s my girl, but why they do that to her hair?\" wrote someone else.",
      "Another music lover questioned how anyone could take the statue of Turner seriously. \"At this point Im convinced that these so-called sculptors are trolling us,\" the person wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, others who seemed to know something about art blamed the medium rather than the sculptor, like the person who posted side-by-side pics of the Turner statue next to a notorious 2009 statue of comedy legend Lucille Ball that was so hated, the sculptor ended up apologizing for it.",
      "\"Some bronze statues,\" the person reasoned, \"just don\u2019t turn out that well.\""

      "The Palestinian Authority welcomed the plan, praising Trump for his \"sincere and tireless efforts\" to \"end the war on Gaza\" and reiterating its commitment to making reforms that could pave the way for a future Palestinian state.",
      "Under the plan, Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza would end immediately once it\u2019s agreed by both sides, with all hostages, alive and dead, to be released within a 72-hour period. The plan says no one will be forced to leave Gaza.",
      "A pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood is outlined as a possibility \u2014 but not a guarantee.",
      "And hours after announcing the plan alongside Trump, Netanyahu vowed again to oppose a Palestinian state. \"Instead of Hamas isolating us, we turned the tables and isolated Hamas,\" Netanyahu said in a Hebrew video discussing his U.S. trip.",
      "Diana Buttu, a Palestinian lawyer and former adviser to Yasser Arafat\u2019s Palestinian Liberation Organization, said Palestinians and leaders across the Middle East had little choice but to accept the plan.",
      "She nonetheless criticized it as having \u201cnot a single guarantee\u201d for the people of Gaza, who would be overseen by an international security force and a transitional authority chaired by Trump.",
      "\"Because everybody wants to see an end to the genocide, you're going to see that so many people are going to welcome this plan,\"  Buttu told NBC News in a phone interview.",
      "But, she said, \"there\u2019s not a single guarantee that\u2019s being given to Palestinians, not one.\" Buttu added that she had little faith in the possibility that the plan if executed would lead to internationally recognized Palestinian statehood.",
      "In Gaza, weary Palestinians have long been desperate to see an end to Israel\u2019s deadly offensive in the enclave.",
      "\u201cLife is unbearable, there\u2019s nothing \u2014 no food, no drinks no clothes,\u201d Abdallah Qamar told the AP last week from famine-stricken Gaza City, where Israel has been carrying out a sweeping ground offensive.",
      "In Israel, the plan to end the assault is likely to be welcomed by many within a populace increasingly critical of the war. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of hostages, welcomed the plan.",
      "The proposal is unlikely to win favor, however, among the far-right members of Netanyahu's fragile government coalition upon whom his leadership relies.",
      "In a lengthy post on X on Tuesday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he believed Trump's plan would only \"end in tears,\" calling early celebrations \"absurd.\"",
      "On that, Buttu agreed, condemning the apparent lack of involvement of Palestinians in the bid to determine their future.",
      "\"They're deciding and talking about Palestinians, but never to Palestinians \u2014 and that's the part that is truly terrifying.\""

      "The embattled leader is set to tell his restive Labour Party that it is in a \u201cfight for the soul of our country,\" in an address Tuesday to its annual conference in Liverpool.",
      "Starmer, 63, faces threats from all sides.",
      "The Reform U.K. party led by Nigel Farage, a staunch ally and friend of President Donald Trump, is leading the polls. He has capitalized on discontent over the cost-of-living that has seen a rise in concern over immigration.",
      "This is a familiar story across Europe, where mainstream centrists such as France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and Germany\u2019s Friedrich Merz are being out-polled by nationalists and populists on the hard right.",
      "Starmer\u2019s attempted fightback has been to reject Farage \u2014 who he called \u201cracist\u201d this week \u2014 but also to deploy tougher talk on immigration himself.",
      "He is set to tell the party in Liverpool that it must make \u201cdecisions that will not always be comfortable for our party. Yet at the end of this hard road there will be a new country, a fairer country, a land of dignity and respect,\u201d according to a partial transcript released by the party ahead of time.",
      "Starmer \"needs to stamp his authority on the party and show he has a political story to tell that they can rally round,\" according to Anand Menon, director of the U.K. in a Changing Europe think tank and a professor at King's College London.",
      "Not only has this strategy so far failed to shift Starmer\u2019s dismal polling, it has also triggered dismay from Labour\u2019s traditional  left-of-center support base. They accuse him of abandoning Labour\u2019s foundational liberal values.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he turns it around by leaning into Reform party rhetoric, which presents migrants and asylum seekers as the fundamental problem in Britain \u2014 they\u2019re not,\u201d said Scott Lucas, a politics professor at University College Dublin. \u201cBritain\u2019s fundamental problem is economic,\u201d Lucas told NBC News. And so the question for Starmer is: \u201cCan you return to Labor\u2019s focus on public services, on competence and on finding a way forward which relies more on consensus rather than division?\u201d he added.",
      "NBC News has reached out to the Labour Party for comment on Starmer's negative polling and the criticism of his leadership.",
      "The world\u2019s 6th largest economy is suffering from years of sluggish growth and stubborn inflation that\u2019s forecast to be the highest this year among the G-7, a club of Western nations that includes the United States and Canada.",
      "As in the U.S., that\u2019s driven up prices for everyday goods, but real wages in Britain have stagnated since the global financial crisis of 2008. Subsequent budget cuts have left public services such as the National Heath Service crumbling in the face of rising demand.",
      "During last year's election, Starmer promised the British public that he would not raise taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d \u2014 including income tax. But economic headwinds have fueled speculation that he may be forced into a U-turn during November's annual budget. Starmer has already been forced into humiliating climb-downs on pensioners' winter fuel payments and welfare reform.",
      "He has also announced the introduction of digital ID cards \u2014 an attempt to clamp down on people working illegally that has been criticized by civil liberties groups \u2014 as well as formal recognition of Palestinian statehood, which has caused friction with Trump and whose critics say is too little, too late.",
      "Though Starmer is technically safe until 2029, the scheduled date of the next election, he could come under threat before then if his party decides his leadership has become too toxic. The Labour Party conference this week has been awash with rumors that Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester often described in British media as \u201cthe King of the North,\u201d could mount a leadership challenge.",
      "Burnham has cooled that talk but even so, this has been a tumultuous year for Starmer\u2019s own internal operation.",
      "During the election, he ran on a platform of decency and abiding by the rules, an antithesis to the scandal-plagued ruling Conservative Party.",
      "That narrative has been weakened by a series of ministerial resignations, culminating in that of Starmer\u2019s own deputy, Angela Rayner, after it was revealed she underpaid property taxes.",
      "Starmer has also carried out a radical overhaul of his internal communications team in a bid to reverse his downward fortunes. On Tuesday, his press office said his speech would mark a \u201cfork in the road\u201d for the country.",
      "\u201cThe question is, fork in the road moment for what?\u201d said Lucas at University College Dublin. \u201cThere\u2019s a fork in the road moment for Labour, at least in terms of where are we going to go with the question of immigration and a proper asylum system,\u201d he said. \u201cCan Starmer show that he still has authority within the party when you\u2019ve got a rising hard right?\u201d"

      "\u201cThe festival is the largest of its kind globally, bringing together a selection of award-winning comedy stars known for their outstanding performances on international stages and streaming platforms,\u201d the Saudi Press Agency wrote in its announcement for the General Entertainment Authority. \u201cIt reflects the efforts to amplify Riyadh\u2019s status as a leading destination for major cultural and artistic events.\u201d",
      "Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich home of Islam\u2019s two holiest sites, was for years among the most socially conservative nations on Earth with a morality police enforcing a strict interpretation of Shariah. In recent years under the rule of de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country expanded its cultural and political influence by diversifying its economy and investing in sports, entertainment and tourism to improve its global image. Along with this, the crown prince oversaw a sweeping crackdown on dissent \u2014 imprisoning disgruntled royals, women\u2019s rights advocates, and reforming clerics as well as adherents to previously government-sanctioned proponents of strict Wahhabi Islam.",

      "The nonprofit watchdog organization noted that some of the events land on the seventh anniversary of the assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul by intelligence operatives with close ties to the crown prince. The festival also takes place just months after Saudi authorities executed Turki al-Jasser, a journalist known for exposing corruption within the Saudi royal family.",
      "\u201cThe seventh anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s brutal murder is no laughing matter,\u201d Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cAnd comedians receiving hefty sums from Saudi authorities shouldn\u2019t be silent on prohibited topics in Saudi like human rights or free speech.\u201d",
      "Other listed performers for the festival include: Sebastian Maniscalco, Maz Jobrani, Tom Segura, Whitney Cummings, Jimeoin, Russell Peters, Andrew Santino, Bobby Lee, Chris Distefano, Mark Normand, Gabriel Iglesias, Hannibal Buress, Sam Morril, Jeff Ross, Omid Djalili, Ali Siddiq, Zarna Garg, Chris Tucker and Ben Hart.",

      "But it has also made significant inroads with some powerful figures in the West, most notably the Trump family. President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner worked with the Saudis to secure a $2 billion investment in his firm and recently partnered with the country\u2019s public investment fund to strike a $55 billion deal to take the video game giant Electronic Arts private.

      "The giants of the Amazon are getting even bigger.",
      "A sweeping, new study has found the rainforest\u2019s largest trees are not only holding their ground, but they\u2019re thriving \u2014 growing, multiplying in number and continuing to play a major role in mitigating the impacts of climate change.",
      "There was a 3.3% expansion in big trees per decade, scientists found, after tracking changes in 188 intact forest plots across the Amazon over the past 30 years.",
      "Led by almost 100 researchers from 60 universities in Brazil, the U.K. and elsewhere, the findings were published Thursday in the journal Nature Plants.",
      "The authors attributed the growth to the rising amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the burning of gas, oil and coal.",
      "The paper was welcomed as evidence of forest resilience in the face of climate change, but scientists warned these big trees remain vulnerable as droughts, lightning and fires are increasing in frequency, while deforestation continues to pose a serious threat.",
      "There was an understanding that big trees were \u201cexpected to be vulnerable to climate change,\u201d Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert, one of the study\u2019s lead authors, told NBC News in a telephone interview Saturday. \u201cWhat we see here is actually they seem to be showing quite a resilience.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing signs of them dying off,\u201d said Esquivel-Muelbert, who co-authored the study while at Britain\u2019s University of Birmingham but has since moved to the nearby University of Cambridge. \u201cThey are increasing in size and number as well.\u201d",
      "Scientists stressed that while protecting intact forest areas was essential to stabilizing the climate, the Amazon cannot on its own offset the vast amount of carbon dioxide produced worldwide by cars, factories and power stations \u2014 and it remains under threat.",
      "The rainforest is a carbon sink, meaning it stores more carbon than it produces. Pushing the rainforest past its limit could accelerate climate change and have terrible consequences for local communities, including Indigenous groups who depend on it.",
      "Esquivel-Muelbert stressed it was difficult to predict how worsening climate change would have an impact in the future, and hesitated to say that increased CO2 benefited the forest, warning it may cause bigger trees to become more exposed to other factors like drought.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know the consequences in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Other factors, including deforestation, remain a colossal risk to the health of the Amazon.",
      "Fattening trees is, in some ways, a \u201cpositive news story,\u201d said Rebecca Banbury Morgan, a lead author of the study from the University of Bristol. But it also means that the forest is now \u201cmore vulnerable to losing those trees.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough we have shown that trees in intact forest are still increasing in size, any benefits of this in terms of the carbon sink can be quite easily negated by deforestation and logging impacts, so preserving these intact forests is really a priority,\u201d she told NBC News.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled a comprehensive peace proposal to end the war in Gaza, nearly two years after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",
      "During his visit with Trump at the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly backed the 20-point plan, but Trump acknowledged that Hamas had not agreed to it.",
      "The key components of the proposal include the release of all living and dead hostages in Gaza, a requirement for Hamas to lay down its arms, a withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territory, the delivery of humanitarian aid and the installation of a civilian governing authority for Palestinians.",
      "Trump said that if Hamas rejects the deal, he would back Netanyahu in dismantling and destroying Hamas.",
      "Here is the full text of the plan:",
      "Gaza will be a deradicalized terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors.",
      "Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough.",
      "If both sides agree to this proposal, the war will immediately end. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal.",
      "Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned.",
      "Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1700 Gazans who were detained after October 7th 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans.",
      "Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.",
      "Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip. At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the January 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.",
      "Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the January 19, 2025 agreement.",
      "Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza. This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the \u201cBoard of Peace,\u201d which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J. Trump, with other members and heads of State to be announced, including Former Prime Minister Tony Blair. This body will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program, as outlined in various proposals, including President Trump\u2019s peace plan in 2020 and the Saudi-French proposal, and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza. This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment.",
      "A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza.",
      "A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries.",
      "No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.",
      "Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.",
      "A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people.",
      "The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A deconfliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties.",
      "Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the Unites States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat.",
      "In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF.",
      "An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful co-existence to try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis by emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace.",
      "While Gaza re-development advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.",
      "The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence."

      "\u201cIntense negotiations have been going on for four days, and will continue for as long as necessary in order to get a Successfully Completed Agreement,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, calling the discussions \u201cvery inspired and productive.\u201d",
      "Trump did not provide any details about the agreement being discussed, but he has previously insisted that Hamas return all of the remaining Israeli hostages kept in Gaza as part of any deal. In his post, he called for \u201cPERMANENT AND LONGLASTING PEACE!\u201d",
      "Negotiations for either a complete end to the fighting or a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange have previously stalled as both Israel and Hamas have accused the other of reneging on promises, changing details and rejecting deals accepted by the other.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faced a mass walkout as he spoke at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Friday, has vowed to continue the war until all the hostages are returned and Hamas has been disarmed, and to maintain lasting security control over Gaza.",
      "After dozens of diplomats left the room, Netanyahu reiterated his intention to \u201cfinish the job\u201d against Hamas in Gaza, in a combative speech that also saw him attack the recognition of a Palestinian state by multiple Western countries.",
      "Israel and the U.S. have both said that the move risks rewarding  Hamas, which carried out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 hostages were taken into Gaza, according to Israel.",
      "Israel has killed more than 65,000 people in Gaza over the past 23 months, according to health officials in the enclave. It has also destroyed vast areas of the strip, displaced around 90% of the population and caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.",
      "Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Trump said Friday that the militant group was \u201cvery much aware of these discussions, and Israel has been informed at all levels,\u201d including Netanyahu. \u201cThere is more Goodwill and Enthusiasm for getting a Deal done, after so many decades, than I have ever seen before,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump presented proposals to Arab nations on Monday \u2014 including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt \u2014 during a meeting held on the sidelines of the annual General Assembly, according to his special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "Netanyahu, meanwhile, met with the foreign minister for the United Arab Emirates in New York on Friday. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan stressed an urgent need to end the war in Gaza and to reach a permanent and sustainable ceasefire, his office said.",
      "Bin Zayed also reiterated support for efforts to achieve a two-state solution in the region, at the same time as Israel pushes ahead with a widely condemned settlement plan that would effectively split the West Bank in two, further fracturing what Palestinians envision as their future state.",
      "UAE leaders have previously said annexation of the West Bank would be a red line for the influential Gulf state, blocking any future recognition of Israel and preventing the completion of Trump\u2019s landmark Abraham Accords that sought to establish diplomatic normalization between Israel and several Arab states including the UAE.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he would not let Israel annex the occupied West Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "In September, Israel launched a widely condemned ground offensive into Gaza City, the enclave\u2019s most populous area, driving out hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom had previously been displaced on multiple occasions.",
      "Doctors Without Borders said Friday that it had been forced to leave the city in northern Gaza. \u201cWe have been left with no choice but to stop our activities, as our clinics are encircled by Israeli forces,\u201d it said on X.",
      "Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 40 people across Gaza on Saturday, including 23 from Gaza City, Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health, told NBC News.",
      "The spiraling conflict in the Middle East has been a focal point of the General Assembly this week. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas addressed the gathering Thursday, albeit by video after the U.S. last month revoked his visa, along with those of other Palestinian Authority officials.",
      "Palestinians in Gaza \u201chave been facing a war of genocide, destruction, starvation and displacement\u201d by Israel, he said, adding that Palestinians rejected Hamas\u2019 terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and that action did not represent their people."

      "\u201cI took very crystal-clear positions in speeches that I gave in certain places in mosques, I clearly said this should not have occurred,\u201d Pezeshkian said.",
      "While this is not the first time Pezeshkian, who is considered a moderate and has criticized officials and security forces, has spoken out about the implementation of Iran\u2019s hijab laws and subsequent crackdowns, he also said the rest of the world was \u201cblowing things out of proportion.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course, each human life is priceless,\u201d he said. But, \u201con a daily basis, hundreds of people are being killed in Lebanon, in Gaza, in all over Palestine, in Yemen and Syria, yet no one bats an eye? Why? These are less human beings?\u201d",
      "Despite Pezeshkian\u2019s moderate position on the issue of hijab, observers say he has little power to stop security forces who have used the war with Israel last June as a pretext to carry out mass arrests of ethnic and religious minorities as well as Afghan migrants, according to human rights groups.",
      "The interview was conducted with a government interpreter present and translating in real time, and NBC News reviewed the translation independently.",
      "Nuclear program",
      "Iran has renewed construction work at an underground site dug into the side of a mountain since the United States and Israel bombed the country\u2019s nuclear facilities, in a sign that Tehran is likely trying to rebuild its heavily damaged nuclear program, according to commercial satellite imagery and experts.",
      "In the three months since U.S. and Israeli warplanes struck three main nuclear facilities in Iran, satellite photos from Maxar indicate significant construction activity at Kuh-e Kolang Gaz La, or Pickaxe Mountain, which was not targeted in the air war. The site is near Natanz, a key nuclear facility that the U.S. military hammered with massive \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs in June.",
      "The images show the construction of an elaborate security fence encircling the mountain, a concrete frame built around a tunnel entrance and a growing pile of excavated soil \u2014 suggesting continued tunneling, analysts said.",
      "The Washington Post first reported on the satellite imagery.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Iran is trying to rapidly construct a very deep underground facility just about a mile south of their uranium enrichment facility,\u201d said Joseph Rodgers, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.",
      "\u201cThe construction has really doubled down at Pickaxe Mountain, and they\u2019ve definitely continued to drill,\u201d said Rodgers, who recently produced a report about work at the site.",
      "The White House and CIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Llamas asked about the Washington Post report and whether the regime was building another nuclear facility. Pezeshkian said nuclear inspectors were welcome to visit his country.",
      "\u201cIf they are really telling the truth, we have been \u2026 we have come to an agreement, most recently, with the IAEA. They can come and inspect on the ground,\u201d Pezeshkian said, referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency, a watchdog body.",
      "\u201cTo put something out based on purported satellite photography, it\u2019s not pertinent in order to create frameworks that are not based in reality. In fact, would it not be easier and much more tangible and verifiable to have inspections in person on the ground?\u201d he added.",
      "The purpose of the site remains unknown. The latest satellite photos suggest Iran may be cautiously developing the location as an option for uranium enrichment or other nuclear work beyond the reach of America\u2019s powerful \u201cbunker-buster\u201d munitions, analysts said.",
      "\u201cIf they were planning on giving up their nuclear program, I don\u2019t think we would see this construction,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. \u201cThey are going underground. Maybe they\u2019re coming to the table, but they are definitely going underground.\u201d",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, limited the scope of what Pezeshkian could accomplish during his time in New York when he said in an address on Tuesday that Iran would not talk directly to the U.S. about its nuclear program and would not negotiate on the issue of ballistic missiles or uranium enrichment.",
      "While Iran maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful, hard-line parliamentarians have called for the building of a nuclear weapon. The country now enriches uranium to near-weapons-grade levels \u2014 the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program known to do so.",
      "Asked about the high level of enrichment, Pezeshkian said, \u201cThe religious leader of the country issued fatwa and repeated ... multiple times that it is unholy, or haram, to seek weaponization, to seek nuclear weapons, to seek any type of weapons of mass destruction. This is rooted in our ideology. It is unambiguous. And it is not changeable. So nothing has prevented us from having ... the fullest cooperation with the IAEA.\u201d",
      "On Friday, the United Nations Security Council voted against a Russian and Chinese resolution to delay reimposing sanctions, which, despite the diplomatic push from Pezeshkian and his foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, will very likely lead to penalties being reimposed after the Saturday deadline.",
      "Without a diplomatic breakthrough on the sanctions, critics will likely blast Pezeshkian for coming home empty-handed.",
      "\u201cPezeshkian\u2019s presidential campaign was premised on diplomatic engagement abroad and attempts to moderate the regime\u2019s heavy hand at home,\u201d said Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cMore than a year into office, the limits of significant shifts within a system trapped in half-measures are clear.\u201d",
      "\u2018Set fire\u2019 to the region",
      "Before traveling to the U.S., Pezeshkian was urged by prominent intellectuals and former officials to meet with Trump directly to reduce tension and prevent another attack from the U.S. or Israel. Asked if he was concerned about more war coming to Iran and an expected meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Pezeshkian struck a defiant tone.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of war. We do not seek war,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump has said that his administration has come to create peace, but the path that they have embarked upon will set fire to the entire region.\u201d",
      "He went on to say that while Iran has \u201cnever started a war. We  will never be starting any wars.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut whomever attacks us, we will do our utmost to give them the strongest answer. We will certainly augment our capabilities on a daily basis so as to prevent anyone from attacking us,\u201d Pezeshkian added.",
      "Injury during an airstrike",
      "Pezeshkian, who practiced as a doctor before entering politics, addressed an injury he sustained during the 12-day war with Israel in June, during which senior military leaders, scientists and hundreds of Iranian civilians were killed. Twenty-eight Israelis died during the conflict.",
      "\u201cThey hit us because they were seeking to martyr us like everyone else. We are not afraid of death and martyrdom. We have lived our lives. I have lived my life,\u201d he said.",
      "As for his wounded leg, Pezeshkian said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t anything special.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can just say that it was a hematoma formed in the region of the knee. We dropped the needed liquid and blood, and after that, we got over it,\u201d he added."

      "An inquiry into the attacks found that the attacker had been able to amass a trove of semiautomatic weapons, with authorities failing to enforce proper checks on firearms licenses. The sale of all types of semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles was subsequently banned.",

      "While many heads of state, corporate leaders and prominent figures endorsed a need for urgent international collaboration on AI, the U.S. delegation criticized the role of the U.N. and pushed back on the idea of centralized governance of AI.",
      "Representing the U.S. in Wednesday\u2019s Security Council meeting on AI, Michael Kratsios, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, said, \u201cWe totally reject all efforts by international bodies to assert centralized control and global governance of AI.\u201d",
      "The path to a flourishing future powered by AI does not lie in \u201cbureaucratic management,\u201d Kratsios said, but instead in \u201cthe independence and sovereignty of nations.\u201d",

      "\u201cHopefully, the U.N. can play a constructive role, and it will also be one of the early projects under AI,\u201d Trump said. AI \u201ccould be one of the great things ever, but it also can be dangerous, but it can be put to tremendous use and tremendous good.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, a State Department spokesperson said, \u201cThe United States supports like-minded nations working together to encourage the development of AI in line with our shared values. The US position in international bodies is to vigorously advocate for international AI governance approaches that promote innovation, reflect American values, and counter authoritarian influence.\u201d",
      "The comments rejecting collaborative efforts around AI governance stood in stark contrast to many of the initiatives being launched at the General Assembly.",

      "But in an interview with NBC News, Amandeep Singh Gill, the U.N.\u2019s special envoy for digital and emerging technologies, said that the United States\u2019 critical perception of the U.N.\u2019s role in international AI governance was misconstrued.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a misrepresentation to say that the U.N. is somehow getting into the regulation of AI,\u201d Gill said. \u201cThese are not top-down power grabs in terms of regulation. The regulation stays where regulation can be done in sovereign jurisdictions.\u201d",
      "Instead, the U.N.\u2019s mechanisms \u201cwill provide platforms for international cooperation on AI governance,\u201d Gill said.",
      "In remarks immediately following Kratsios\u2019 comments, China\u2019s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ma Zhaoxu said, \u201cIt is vital to jointly foster an open, inclusive, fair and nondiscriminatory environment for technological development and firmly oppose unilateralism and protectionism.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe support the U.N. playing a central role in AI governance,\u201d Ma said.",
      "One day after Kratsios\u2019 remarks at the Security Council, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez seemed to push back on Kratsios and gave full-throated support for international cooperation on AI and the U.N.\u2019s role in AI governance.",
      "\u201cWe need to coordinate a shared vision of AI at a global level, with the U.N. as the legitimate and inclusive forum to forge consensus around common interests,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cThe time is now, when multilateralism is being most questioned and attacked, that we need to reaffirm how suitable it is in addressing challenges such as those represented by AI.\u201d",
      "Reacting to the week\u2019s developments, Renan Araujo, director of programs for the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for AI Policy and Strategy, told NBC News that \u201cno one wants to see a burdensome, bureaucratic governance structure, and the U.S. has succeeded in starting bilateral and minilateral coalitions. At the same time, we should expect AI-related challenges to become more transnational in nature as AI capabilities become more advanced.\u201d",

      "Chief Justice John Roberts had on Sept. 9 issued a temporary stay that put the lower court ruling on hold while the Supreme Court decided what next steps to take.",
      "The Trump administration, which has aggressively sought to exert its power over Congress in recent months, has notified lawmakers of its intention not to spend the funds.",
      "This action has sparked a debate over whether the president has such authority, as under the Constitution, it is the role of Congress to allocate money for the president to spend.",
      "After the Supreme Court decision, Democrats quickly urged Congress to reassert its authority to control spending even as lawmakers are engaged in a budget fight that could lead to a government shutdown.",
      "\"Republicans should join Democrats to stand up for our power of the purse,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wa. and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. said in a joint statement.",
      "The Trump administration has already taken swift action to unravel the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government department that traditionally handed out billions of dollars a year in foreign aid to tackle such issues as access to water and disease prevention.",
      "The money at issue was appropriated by Congress for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. The Trump administration has said it wants to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid, but will spend another $6.5 billion that Congress appropriated.",
      "The Impoundment Control Act was passed in 1974 to regulate the president\u2019s control over the budget. That followed efforts by then-President Richard Nixon to withhold spending on programs he did not support.",
      "The Trump administration says it can withhold the money via a process known as \"rescission,\" in which the president informs Congress of his intention not to spend certain funds.",
      "But with little time left before the funds expire, Congress is unlikely to respond, even if it wanted to. Republicans who broadly support Trump's policies control both chambers and are in the process of trying to fund the government for the next fiscal year before Oct. 1; otherwise, the government will shut down.",
      "The administration's decision to wait until the end of the fiscal year to notify Congress is a legally questionable tactic that has been called a \"pocket rescission\" and has not been used in nearly 50 years.",
      "Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali had ruled on Sept. 3 that the administration must spend the money unless Congress acts to withdraw it.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in a court filing that Ali's ruling imposed unacceptable restrictions on the president by, among other things, forcing the administration to engage in diplomatic discussions with other countries over how to spend the money",
      "The underlying lawsuit challenging Trump's rescission was brought by various groups led by the Global Health Council.",
      "Their lawyers said in court papers that the administration's legal arguments would turn the Impoundment Control Act on its head by reaching the conclusion that \"Congress\u2019s signature law meant to control impoundments actually provided the President vast new powers to impound funds, and made it virtually impossible to challenge impoundments in court.\""

      "Black liberation activist and American fugitive Assata Shakur, who escaped to Cuba more than 45 years ago after she was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper, died in Havana, the government announced Friday.",
      "She was 78.",
      "Shakur, who changed her name from Joanne Chesimard, died Thursday from health ailments and advanced age, according to a short statement released by the Cuban Foreign Ministry.",
      "\u201cWords cannot describe the depth of loss that I am feeling at this time. I want to thank you for your loving prayers,\u201d her daughter Kakuya Shakur wrote in a Facebook post.",
      "Shakur was involved in a shootout during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1973. State Trooper Werner Foerster, the second officer responding to the scene, found a loaded gun on the driver of the car, according to previous NBC News reporting. Shakur was in the front passenger seat and another man was seated behind her.",
      "There was an exchange of gunfire. James Harper, the state trooper who initially pulled the group over, said he saw Shakur shoot Foerster in the stomach with the officer's gun after he tussled with the driver, who also shot Foerster in the arm.",
      "Shakur and two men she was with returned to the car and drove five miles down the New Jersey Turnpike. One of the men with them, James Coston, died in the car. As they dumped Coston's body on the side of the road, police caught up to the group. Shakur was arrested while the driver fled and was found nearly two days later.",
      "Shakur, who was sentenced to life in prison, denied shooting Foerster. To supporters, she was an activist jailed for crimes she did not commit.",
      "In a statement, Foerster's family said her death did not bring any joy to them, but did bring \"a measure of closure to a tragedy that has deeply affected our family and community.\"",
      "\"While this development marks the end of a long and painful chapter, it does not erase the profound loss we continue to feel each day,\" the family said. \"The pain of losing Werner is something we carry every single day. His absence is felt in every quiet moment, every family gathering, and every milestone he should have been here to witness.\"",
      "Shakur was born Joanne Deborah Byron in Queens, New York, on July 16, 1947. After what she described in her autobiography as a troubled childhood, she became involved in political activism at the Borough of Manhattan Community College and City College of New York. She was a member of the revolutionary Black Liberation Army, as well as the Black Panther Party. At 21, she married Louis Chesimard, though their marriage lasted only a year.",
      "Shakur was serving a life sentence at the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey after being convicted in 1977 of murder in Foerster's death. She had also been implicated in armed robbery and other crimes. She escaped from prison on Nov. 2, 1979, with the help of members of the Black Liberation Army who posed as visitors. She turned up a few years later in Cuba, where the island\u2019s leader at the time, Fidel Castro, granted her political asylum. She published an autobiography in 1987.",
      "Because Cuba repeatedly refused to extradite her to the U.S., Shakur and other fugitives living in Cuba became a major sticking point in negotiations between the U.S. and the communist-run island after President Barack Obama re-established diplomatic relations between the two countries.",
      "Then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Shakur should be returned to New Jersey after the ceremonial reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Cuba in 2015.",
      "Gov. Phil Murphy and state Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan said in a statement Friday that their offices have worked with the State Department in previous attempts to bring Shakur back to New Jersey to face accountability for Foerster's killing and for fleeing the country.",
      "\"We will vigorously oppose any attempt to repatriate Chesimard's remains to the United States,\" they wrote.",
      "Shakur became the first woman on the FBI\u2019s list of most wanted terrorists in 2013. She was added to the list on the anniversary of Foerster\u2019s death. There was a $2 million reward for information leading to her arrest.",
      "Supporters of Shakur, who was rapper Tupac Shakur's godmother through her brother Mutulu Shakur, believed she was a target of law enforcement for her involvement with the Black Liberation Army.",
      "In a 1998 interview with NBC New York in Havana, Shakur said she had never killed anyone and was found guilty in an \u201cunfair trial\u201d by an all-white jury.",
      "\u201cI was shot with my arms in the air, then shot again in the back and left on the ground to die,\u201d she said. \u201cNext thing I knew, they were coming by me and saying, \u2018Is she dead yet, is she dead yet?\u2019\u201d",
      "She said she was later taken to a hospital, where she was beaten and tortured by state troopers who she said would stick their hands in her wounds and ask if it hurt.",
      "\u201cAmerican racism has done to another Black person what it has done to Black people down through the years,\u201d Shakur\u2019s defense attorney William Kunstler said in 1977. \u201cThe reality is, this beautiful young Black woman never had a chance, but we, like liberal fools, still had hopes.\u201d"
