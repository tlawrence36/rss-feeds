      "The last three years have been tough for Fanta Charlotte Dabone, a mother of three from the conflict-battered West African country of Burkina Faso",
      "OUGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso -- The last three years have been tough for Fanta Charlotte Dabone, a mother of three from the conflict-battered West African country of Burkina Faso.",
      "She fled her village after it was attacked by extremists, leaving her husband and her farm behind. Since then, she has been moving from place to place, struggling to pay rent and to buy enough food for her children, including a 2-year-old toddler.",
      "But last month, she got to be a queen.",
      "Every day for a week, together with dozens of other Burkinabe men and women who have been displaced by extremist violence, she swirled, danced and chanted for almost two hours in front of captivated audiences at Recreatrales, an international theater festival held in Ouagadougou, the country's capital.",
      "\u201cI was so happy about it,\" she said. \"I don't even know how to explain how it felt.\u201d",
      "Burkina Faso, a landlocked nation of 23 million in Sahel, an arid strip of land south of the Sahara, used to be known for its bustling arts scene, including renowned film and theater festivals, and its sophisticated craftsmanship.",
      "But in recent years, the country has become the symbol of the security crisis in the region. It has been shaken by violence from extremist groups and the government forces fighting them, much of it spilling over the border with Mali, and by two ensuing military coups.",
      "The military junta, which took power by force in 2022, failed to provide the stability it promised. Instead, the situation deteriorated: According to conservative estimates, more than 60% of the country is now outside of government control, more than 2 million people have lost their homes and almost 6.5 million need humanitarian aid to survive.",
      "The country's leader, Capt. Ibrahim Traore, installed a system of de-facto censorship, where those critical of the regime disappear or get forcefully drafted into the army, and where even friends are afraid to discuss politics with each other.",
      "But against all odds, last month the Bougsemtenga district in the capital turned into a festival grounds to host Recreatrales for the 13th time.",
      "Bougsemtenga derives its name from \u201cbougtenga,\u201d which means \u201chappiness district\u201d in Moore, one of the local languages. True to its origins, this year its streets were transformed into a dreamy universe, resembling a crossover between a traditional village festival and \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\" More than 150 African and European artists performed and over 4,500 theater lovers were able to escape the country's grim reality, if just for a little while.",
      "Improvised theater stages were constructed inside people\u2019s courtyards. The streets were decorated with colorful lights and abstract sculptures made by locals from plastic bottles and scraps of wax-printed fabrics. Residents put up hand decorated stands, selling beer and meat sticks to multinational crowds of theatergoers, ranging from Western diplomats to local mechanics. The ticket booth was a giant frog, its mouth wide open.",
      "Aristide Tarnagda, the festival\u2019s artistic director, said he was convinced that regardless of the insecurity engulfing the country, the festival had to take place as planned.",
      "Theater is an affirmation of \u201cthe primacy of life over death,\u201d Tarnagda said. He added that getting together to perform and watch theatrical productions is a form of resistance against adversity and violence. This is why this year's theme was \"Turning the face to the sun.\u201d",
      "\u201cHumans are capable of love and freedom, but sometimes they forget it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe role of the theater is to remind them about it.\u201d",
      "Held every two years, the festival is the culmination of the yearlong work that the organizers do with residents of the Bougsemtenga district, which was home to two theaters and a theater association even before the first Recreatrales in 2002.",
      "They run art workshops, including in writing, theater, dance and scenography, for young people from the district and from all of Africa, and organize mentoring sessions and business skills classes for local women. The goal is to get as many people as possible involved, said Odile Sankara, the festival's director.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a working class district,\" Sankara said. \u201dWe want to encourage people to take an interest in art, to get a taste of it.\"",
      "She added: \u201cArt is a powerful weapon to fight for more light, more humanity and more love,\u201d especially while her country and the whole Sahel region were going through a security and humanitarian crisis.",
      "Claude Ilboudo, a 30-year-old from Bougsemtenga, has performed in the opening ceremonies of Recreatrales as a dancer since its first edition. He used to work as a glazier, and dancing was just his past time. But Ilboudo's life took a turn when five years ago he severely injured his right hand at work and could no longer do his job.",
      "It was then that Ilboudo discovered a passion for theater and started working for the Recreatrales association. \u201cTheater saved me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt made me discover what I could do.\u201d",
      "This year, Ilboudo was part of the team that prepared the opening play with the internally displaced actors from scratch, including the concept, scenario and choreography. It was also the first time he personally interacted with people who had to flee their homes because of extremist violence.",
      "For internally displaced people, theater is not just a tool for therapy, helping them to process trauma, said Sankara, the artistic director. It's a way for a group that has been marginalized and isolated in Burkinabe society to be seen by others.",
      "During the play, Dabone, the displaced mother of three, stood at center stage with her toddler tied to her back and spit out a long, white paper strip. It symbolized all the haunting thoughts leaving her body, she said. But the question remains \u2014 for how long.",
      "\u201cLife is very difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when I am on the stage, I feel joy. It\u2019s when I go back home that all these thoughts are catching up with me.\"",

      "With a record 99 Grammy nominations and acclaim as one of the most influential artists in music history, pop superstar Beyonc\u00e9 and her expansive cultural legacy will be the subject of a new course at Yale University next year.",
      "Titled \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 Makes History: Black Radical Tradition, Culture, Theory & Politics Through Music,\u201d the one-credit class will focus on the period from her 2013 self-titled album through this year's genre-defying \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d and how the world-famous singer, songwriter and entrepreneur has generated awareness and engagement in social and political ideologies.",
      "Yale University's African American Studies Professor Daphne Brooks intends to use the performer's wide-ranging repertoire, including footage of her live performances, as a \u201cportal\u201d for students to learn about Black intellectuals, from Frederick Douglass to Toni Morrison.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be taking seriously the ways in which the critical work, the intellectual work of some of our greatest thinkers in American culture resonates with Beyonc\u00e9's music and thinking about the ways in which we can apply their philosophies to her work\" and how it has sometimes been at odds with the \u201cBlack radical intellectual tradition,\u201d Brooks said.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9, whose full name is Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter, is not the first performer to be the subject of a college-level course. There have been courses on singer and songwriter Bob Dylan over the years and several colleges and universities have recently offered classes on singer Taylor Swift and her lyrics and pop culture legacy. That includes law professors who hope to engage a new generation of lawyers by using a famous celebrity like Swift to bring context to complicated, real-world concepts.",
      "Professors at other colleges and universities have also incorporated Beyonc\u00e9 into their courses or offered classes on the superstar.",
      "Brooks sees Beyonc\u00e9 in a league of her own, crediting the singer with using her platform to \u201cspectacularly elevate awareness of and engagement with grassroots, social, political ideologies and movements\u201d in her music, including the Black Lives Matter movement and Black feminist commentary.",
      "\u201cCan you think of any other pop musician who\u2019s invited an array of grassroots activists to participate in these longform multimedia album projects that she\u2019s given us since 2013,\" asked Brooks. She noted how Beyonc\u00e9 has also tried to tell a story through her music about \u201crace and gender and sexuality in the context of the 400-year-plus history of African-American subjugation.\"",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a fascinating artist because historical memory, as I often refer to it, and also the kind of impulse to be an archive of that historical memory, it's just all over her work,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cAnd you just don\u2019t see that with any other artist.\u201d",
      "Brooks previously taught a well-received class on Black women in popular music culture at Princeton University and discovered her students were most excited about the portion dedicated to Beyonc\u00e9. She expects her class at Yale will be especially popular, but she's trying to keep the size of the group relatively small.",
      "For those who manage to snag a seat next semester, they shouldn't get their hopes up about seeing Queen Bey in person.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too bad because if she were on tour, I would definitely try to take the class to see her,\" Brooks said."

There\u2019s no great mystery to solve besides how Anthony survived the explosion, and even when the truth is revealed, most readers will have known it long before. Price\u2019s overarching message is a simple one amid the hard-luck stories: People want someone to root for them. Or as Anthony, aka Lazarus Man, tells a crowd at a community event following another death on the streets outside the projects: \u201cWho here, not just in these houses, but anywhere in the world young hearts need to be nurtured and protected, couldn\u2019t use a helping hand?\u201d",

    "summary": "In 2019",
    "story": [
      "In 2019",
      "An entire generation of literary-minded women has not stopped telling itself stories influenced by master storyteller Joan Didion. The same, alas, cannot be said of Eve Babitz, a Hollywood bad girl whose life briefly intersected with Didion\u2019s in the late 1960s and early \u201970s.",
      "Few writers, of course, have the stature of Didion, and Babitz does have a contingent of ardent and influential admirers. Her biggest fangirl might be Lili Anolik, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair whose 2014 article about Babitz, followed by her 2019 biography \u201cHollywood\u2019s Eve,\u201d fueled a revival of interest in her work.",
      "Now Anolik is back with a new book, \u201cDidion & Babitz,\u201d in which she explores the complicated relationship between the frenemies and declares her devotion to the less well-known of the two: \u201cI\u2019m crazy for Eve, love her with a fan\u2019s unreasoning abandon. Besides, Joan is somebody I naturally root against: I respect her work rather than like it; find her persona \u2014 part princess, part wet blanket \u2014 tough going; and resent her for siccing on us, the innocent reading public, an army, seemingly unending, of middle-class young-women personal essayists who take their feelings very ultra-seriously and expect us to do the same.\u201d",
      "The two women met in 1967 when Didion and her husband, John Gregory Dunne, were living at 7406 Franklin Avenue in Hollywood, a louche time and place that Didion immortalized in her breakout collection of nonfiction, \u201cSlouching Towards Bethlehem.\u201d",
      "In 1971, Didion helped Babitz get a story published in Rolling Stone magazine \u2014 \u201cShe is a painter, not a writer,\u201d Didion told the editor. Eventually, that led to a book deal. But their friendship fractured when Didion and Dunne were enlisted by Babitz\u2019s publisher to edit the book, which became \u201cEve\u2019s Hollywood,\u201d and Babitz bristled at their criticism. Later, she boasted to a friend, \u201cI fired Joan.\u201d",
      "Anolik makes a convincing case for Babitz\u2019s literary genius and sets up an interesting contrast between the two women\u2014 one loose, libidinous and joyfully debauched; the other shy, cerebral and tightly controlled.",
      "But don\u2019t expect the calm, organized, even-handed approach of a literary critic or biographer. In the breathless, gossipy style of the tabloids, and with frequent, winking asides to the \u201cReader,\u201d Anolik dishes dirt on all the major and minor players in their haute bohemian circle, especially Didion and Dunne. In the end, everyone ends up looking bad, including, sadly, Babitz.",

That cozy perennial pastime where \u2014 let\u2019s just pick one scene from \u201cRed One\u201d \u2014 Dwayne Johnson, playing Santa\u2019s body guard, faces off with a witch-possessed mercenary (Nick Kroll) and ice-sword-wielding CGI snowmen on the sandy beaches of Aruba. Can\u2019t you just taste the eggnog?",
      "Such are the ugly-sweater clashes of \u201cRed One,\u201d a big-budget gambit to supersize the Christmas movie. Countless movies before have wrestled with who Santa is. Does he really exist? But \u201cRed One\u201d is the first one to answer doubters with a superhero-like St. Nick who runs his North Pole operation like the army, who bench presses and counts carbs and who, given that he\u2019s played by J.K. Simmons, looks like he could teach one heck of a jazz class.",
      "There is ample time during \u201cRed One,\u201d which opens in theaters Thursday, to ponder who, exactly, put a Marvel-ized Santa on their wish list. The movie, directed by the \u201cJumanji\u201d reboot filmmaker Jake Kasdan and scripted by the veteran \u201cFast & Furious\u201d screenwriter Chris Morgan, was conceived by producer Hiram Garcia as the start of a holiday franchise for Amazon MGM Studios \u2014 presumably to satisfy those who have pined for a Christmas movie but with, you, know, more military industrial complex.",
      "\u201cRed One,\u201d which is brightened by its other A-list star, Chris Evans, is a little self-aware about its own inherent silliness. But not nearly enough. There is a better, funnier movie underneath all the CGI gloss. But overwhelmed by effects and overelaborate world building (there are trolls, ogres and a headless horsemen here, all loosely connected as mythical creatures), \u201cRed One\u201d feels like an unwanted high-priced Christmas present.",
      "\u201cI love the kids. It\u2019s the grown-ups that are killing me.\u201d",
      "So announces Callum Drift (Johnson), a long-serving security operative for Santa. He\u2019s not an elf but a member of ELF, Enforcement Logistics and Fortification. (Don\u2019t you just feel the holiday cheer welling up inside?) But after years, even centuries on the job, Callum\u2019s faith in Christmas traditions is waning. For the first time, those on the naughty list outnumber the nice. On a mall visit two days before Christmas, he looks despondently at adults bickering over presents, if not outright stealing them.",
      "Callum and other operatives with earpieces shuttle Santa (\u201cRed One\u201d in their secret service-styled lingo) in a fleet of Suburbans to his sleigh, which, while pulled by reindeer, moves more like a spaceship. Back at the North Pole \u2014 picture a sort of wintery Abu Dhabi \u2014 Santa is kidnapped. The culprits leave only spilt milk behind. The ensuing hunt, overseen by the chief of a special ops group protecting mystical beings (Lucy Liu), leads immediately to a hacker who helped an anonymous client geolocate Santa.",
      "The for-hire hacker, Jack O\u2019Malley (Evans) is a deadbeat dad to his son (Wesley Kimmel), and, we\u2019re informed, a \u201clevel-four naughty-lister.\u201d Evans might be most famous for his Captain America, but smarmy smart-aleck (like in \u201cKnives Out\u201d) is really his wheelhouse. And he gives \u201cRed One\u201d some comic energy as it transitions into a sort of buddy comedy with him and Johnson.",
      "But \u201cRed One\u201d keeps overdoing it. As they race to rescue Santa before Christmas Eve, the hunt brings in the villainous Christmas Witch, Gryla (Kiernan Shipka) and Krampus (Kristofer Hivju), here defined as Santa's brother. The sensation, with these characters and others, is of stuffing too much into an already gaudy stocking, and yet somehow forgetting to add any charm.",
      "\u201cRed One\u201d comes off a little like the holiday version of \u201cCowboys and Aliens\" \u2014 enough so to make you nostalgic for leaner tales about folkloric figures starring Johnson, like \u201cThe Tooth Fairy.\u201d But if we're to have every possible brand of Christmas movie, it seems a shame that when the phrase \u201cThe North Pole has been taken!\u201d Gerard Butler is nowhere to be seen.",
      "\u201cRed One,\u201d an Amazon MGM Studios release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for action, some violence, and language. Running time: 133 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

He appeared in episodes of everything from \u201cLeave to Beaver\u201d and \u201cMy Three Sons\u201d to \u201cThis is Us\u201d and \u201cCSI.\u201d",
      "The 76-year-old has hundreds of acting, directing and producing credits to his name over a career that began when John F. Kennedy was president. (Yes, Matheson played him on screen, too.)",
      "Matheson transports readers to the sets of quite a few of his Hollywood gigs in the enjoyable and illuminating memoir, \u201cDamn Glad to Meet You: My Seven Decades in the Hollywood Trenches.\u201d",
      "The book's title is a nod to the recurring line Matheson delivers as Eric \u201cOtter\u201d Stratton, the Delta rush chairman in the all-time comedy, \u201cAnimal House.\"",
      "The section on the making of the classic 1978 film is almost worth the book's purchase price alone. Spoiler alert: Some of the actors who played Delta House members got up to their own hijinks while on location at the University of Oregon, the stand-in for the fictional Faber College. The description of the cast's visit to a real frat party in Eugene is a particular highlight.",
      "\u201cDamn Glad to Meet You\" isn't all fun and games, though. It features some helpful tips and tricks on acting/directing and navigating the Hollywood jungle as well as some poignant moments. Matheson recounts the time he spent with some actors/comedians who were taken too early, including John Candy, Chris Farley and Sam Kinison \u2014 plus, his \u201cAnimal House\u201d co-star John Belushi.",
      "\u201cYou came for some Belushi stories,\u201d Matheson writes. \u201cI know. He's who I'm asked about more than anyone else I've ever worked with, and I've worked with almost everyone.\u201d",
      "These days, Matheson is working north of the border, where his hit Netflix show, \u201cVirgin River,\u201d is shot.",
      "It's just the latest in a very long line of roles the native Californian has taken on in his productive and lengthy career.",
      "\u201cI've been lucky. I know that,\" Matheson writes. \u201cI've always found a place to tell a story.\u201d",
      "And now, he's telling us his stories. We should be damn glad he did.",

      "NEW YORK -- Toy giant Mattel says it \u201cdeeply\u201d regrets an error on the packaging of its \u201cWicked\u201d movie-themed dolls, which mistakenly links toy buyers to a pornographic website.",
      "The error gained attention on social media over the weekend, where numerous users shared photos of the URL printed on the back of the boxes for the special edition dolls, which feature characters from the movie adaptation of \u201cWicked\u201d set to hit theaters later this month. Instead of linking to Universal Pictures' official WickedMovie.com page, the website listed leads to an adult film site that requires consumers to be over 18 to enter.",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Mattel said it was \u201cmade aware of a misprint on the packaging of the Mattel Wicked collection dolls,\" which it said are primarily sold in the U.S. \u201cWe deeply regret this unfortunate error and are taking immediate action to remedy this,\u201d the company added.",
      "Mattel did not confirm whether this action included removing unsold products with the incorrect link from stores. But as of Monday morning, at least some of these \u201cWicked\u201d dolls appeared to be no longer available or not in stock on sites like Amazon, Target and Mattel's.",
      "In the meantime, the company is advising consumers who already have the dolls to discard their packaging or obscure the link \u2014 and contact Mattel's customer service for more information.",
      "Mattel unveiled its special \u201cWicked\u201d collection earlier this year. Back in July, a promotion shared on Instagram showed Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, who star as Elphaba and Glinda in Universal Pictures' upcoming film, seeing the line's singing dolls for the first time.",
      "The beloved Broadway musical has been split into two parts for its movie adaptation. The first chapter of \u201cWicked\u201d will hit theaters on Nov. 22, with part two set for a fall 2025 release."

    "story": [
      "\u201dThose Opulent Days\u201d is a historical novel set in the Vietnam of the 1920s, when it was part of colonial French Indochina",
      "It\u2019s not often that a historical novel is set in the Vietnam of the 1920s, a period when the land in Indochina was occupied and exploited by French colonizers. It\u2019s also unusual that such a novel would be a whodunit murder mystery.",
      "\u201cThose Opulent Days,\u201d the debut novel of Jacquie Pham, is both \u2014 and a grim coming-of-age story as well.",
      "Pham, who grew up in Vietnam before moving to Australia, ably describes the land of her youth, its history and culture, including the well-heeled Vietnamese who were complicit in the French plunder of resources a century ago.",
      "\u201cThe French ruled the colony,\u201d she writes in the novel, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t understand its people \u2014 they needed locals, rich enough, corrupt and ambitious enough, to supply them with insight and cash.\u201d",
      "She vividly describes the Vietnamese peasants working long hours in rice paddies, bare feet in muddy water, pale yellow conical hats to block the harsh sun. \u201cThe fields were a vast, luscious green carpet,\u201d Pham writes, \u201calways filled with the fresh, intoxicating scent of young shoots.\u201d But little of this bounty went to impoverished, starving peasant families. \u201cThey would pay ground rent on a monthly basis, with hardly anything to call their own,\u201d Pham writes.",
      "As a mystery novel, \u201cThose Opulent Days\u201d is well-plotted, with a tangled web of possible outcomes. But the allure of the book\u2019s guessing-game narrative and its historical context does not carry over into a fully satisfying reading experience.",
      "The story is beset in part by a cast of vile characters and an overdose of melodramatic scenes. The French rulers and their prosperous Vietnamese collaborators, while living in regal splendor, partake of casual cruelty and horrid murders to such an extent they resemble cardboard cutouts of villains.",
      "This extends partly to the four boys whose fate growing up is at the core of the coming-of-age story. The four are Duy, Minh and Phong, sons of well-to-do families in Annam, as the region then was known, and Edmond, a French youth who met them at a boarding school. They are a mix of friends, rivals and would-be lovers. They binge on opium and alcohol. When they reach their early 20s, they near a dreaded, deadly end predicted by a fortune teller years earlier.",
      "The author understandably wants to convey the reality of the raw power held by the occupying masters over helpless underlings in the French Indochina era. But she has done so at the expense of solid storytelling.",
      "Pham is a young writer with a lot to offer. She succeeds admirably in laying out an enticing mystery, which makes for easy reading even when overwrought. And by linking it to a faded period of history, presaging the United States\u2019 own tragedy in the Vietnam War, she establishes herself as a writer to watch.",

    "summary": "&ldquo;Gladiator II&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t quite the prestige film that the first one, a best-picture winner, was",
    "story": [
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d isn\u2019t quite the prestige film that the first one, a best-picture winner, was",
      "Rome teeters on the brink in Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Its fall is said to be imminent. The dream it once symbolized is dead. The once high-minded ideals of the Roman Empire have deteriorated across a venal land now ruled by a pale-faced emperor.",
      "On the throne is Geta (Joseph Quinn), who sits alongside his sniveling brother, Caracalla (Fred Hechinger). The heart of this Rome, of course, is the Coliseum, where throngs cheer for the gladiators who fight and die. There, the ageless Scott remains remarkably at home. The arena, with its eruptions of spectacle and violence, is a stand in for the director\u2019s own vision of the big screen: Go big or go home.",
      "This dichotomy \u2014 a fallen society and its insatiable need for entertainment \u2014 is the clever and not altogether flattering backdrop of the \u201cGladiator\u201d films. Part two, set 20 years after the events of the first movie, brings a new combatant to the Coliseum \u2014 a mysterious outsider named Lucius Verus, played by Paul Mescal. And to answer the inevitable question, yes. Yes, I was quite entertained.",
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d isn\u2019t quite the prestige film the first one, a best-picture winner, was in 2001. It\u2019s more a swaggering, sword-and-sandal epic that prizes the need to entertain above all else. No one in \u201cGladiator II\u201d understands that more than Denzel Washington. His performance as the Machiavellian power broker Macrinus is a delicious blur of robes and grins \u2013 so compellingly over-the-top that he nearly reaches 1990s Al Pacino standards.",
      "Inside this Rome are scattered interests in toppling it, including Marcus Acacius, a decorated general who has just returned from a successful campaign taking Numidia in northwest Africa. (That siege makes the movie\u2019s blistering opening, with an armada racing at almost NASCAR speed toward the walled city, with towers on the bows of the boats to scale the parapets.)",
      "Acacius is a loyal Roman but, when he learns that the emperors have only more bloodlust for further territory and more war, he and his wife, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) begin plotting to overthrow the brothers.",
      "In a movie where everyone nurtures some secret, few stay hidden long. Foremost among them is Lucius Verus, a warrior in Numidia who\u2019s taken prisoner and forced to fight as a gladiator. He\u2019s the son of Lucilla and Maximus (Crowe in \u201cGladiator\u201d). Following the events of that film, Lucilla sent him, an heir to the empire, to Numidia to grow up outside of the empire\u2019s power struggles.",
      "Mescal, the terrific Irish actor of \u201cAftersun\u201d and \u201cAll of Us Strangers,\u201d smoothly steps into a blockbuster arena for the first time. \u201cThis one is interesting,\u201d says Macrinus, eyeing him for the first time. Mescal\u2019s Lucius is vengeful \u2014 the Roman army kills his warrior wife in the Numidia battle. \u201cRage pours out of you like milk,\u201d Macrinus says, admiringly. The glint of mischief in Mescal\u2019s eyes gives Lucius a little more character than your average revenge-seeking gladiator.",
      "We watch as Lucius cunningly survives arena after arena. Meanwhile, Macrinus manipulates him to steer the public\u2019s routing interest away from the emperor. It\u2019s a rich if slightly cartoonish tapestry of palace intrigue, with Macrinus deftly pulling all the strings.",
      "But, really, none of the power machinations are as compelling as the increasingly carnivalesque scenes of the Coliseum. In the gladiators' first trip there, they\u2019re greeted by man-eating monkeys. Next, it\u2019s a rider atop a giant, charging rhinoceros. Then, the piece de resistance: a flooded Coliseum festering with sharks. There are even little mock islands with palm trees spread about.",

      "Latin music has taken the world by storm",
      "NEW YORK -- Latin music has taken the world by storm, sparking industry conversations for the past few years. Across platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, numbers have skyrocketed, making it the fastest growing streaming genre in the United States.",
      "The Latin Grammy Awards, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, has worked to recognize and promote Latin music worldwide. This year, the Latin Recording Academy brings its star-studded celebration to Miami, the heart of Latin culture in the U.S., where they are headquartered. Here is what to know:",
      "The 25th Annual Latin Grammy Awards will take place Nov. 14 at the Kaseya Center in Miami. It will air live on Univision, UniM\u00e1s, Galavisi\u00f3n and ViX beginning at 8 p.m. EST.",
      "For the second consecutive year, producer and songwriter \u00c9dgar Barrera leads the nominations. Known for his work with artists like Madonna, Karol G, Peso Pluma, Shakira and Grupo Frontera \u2014 Barrera is up for nine awards. Last year he received 13 nominations and won three.",
      "Close behind him are some of his collaborators, reggaet\u00f3n superstars Karol G and Bad Bunny, who are tied with eight nominations each.",
      "Performers at this year's bash include Barrera, Residente, Myke Towers, DJ Khaled, Jon Bon Jovi, Joe Jonas, Anitta, Becky G, Eladio Carri\u00f3n, Grupo Frontera, Kali Uchis, Pitbull, Luis Fonsi, Juan Luis Guerra, Car\u00edn Le\u00f3n and more.",
      "Colombian singer Carlos Vives, the recipient of the 2024 Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year, will also perform.",
      "There are also two new categories this year: best Latin electronic music performance, housed within the new electronic music field, and best contemporary Mexican music album.",
      "Latin Recording Academy CEO Manuel Abud likens the Recording Academy \u2014 the governing body behind the Grammys \u2014 and the Latin Recording Academy to sister organizations.",
      "\u201cOr maybe even mother and daughter,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThe basis is the same: We are membership-based organizations for music creators and music professionals. So, we\u2019re celebrating musical excellence. We have the exact DNA. Our entire process is a Grammy process.\"",
      "While the Grammys focus on the U.S. market, he says, the Latin Grammys have different global considerations. \"Our voting process is, I would say, identical, but it has some adjustments for the international component that we have that they don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "He adds that artists can be dual members of the Recording Academy and the Latin Recording Academy, if they are Latin artists based in the U.S.",
      "The trophies themselves are also very similar: Both are gramophone-shaped, but the base of a Latin Grammy is burgundy, while the Grammys' is black.",
      "\"We are a licensee of the Recording Academy,\u201d said Abud. \u201cThe Recording Academy has four members on my board, including their chair and their CEO.\u201d",
      "In the late \u201990s and early \u201900s, Latin artists had success when they \u201ccrossed over\u201d and performed in English: \u201cThe Ricky Martins and the Gloria Estefans,\u201d as Abud describes them. But today, he said, artists are singing in Spanish. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to do the crossover.\u201d",
      "And even more noteworthy: English-speaking artists now want to work with Spanish-speaking artists in their native language.",
      "Gabriel Abaroa Jr., the Latin Recording Academy's former president and CEO (2003-2021) and current president emeritus agrees.",
      "He traces the story of the Latin Grammys to 1997, when the Recording Academy started paying closer attention to Latin music. That same year, the Latin Recording Academy was established to celebrate the diverse musical landscape of Latin music in Latin America, Spain, Brazil, Portugal and beyond \u2014 not just the artists breaking through in the U.S.",
      "The inaugural Latin Grammy Awards were held in Los Angeles in 2000, followed by shows in Miami, New York City, Houston, Seville, Spain and Las Vegas.",
      "Initially, the awards ceremony was broadcast in English, a decision that proved to be a misstep. \u201cAsking our talent to communicate in English was pretty bad,\u201d recalls Abaroa Jr. \u201cThe artists didn\u2019t want to (participate) because they felt that we were disrespecting them by making them speak in a language other than theirs.\"",
      "The worst part, he said, was that even the Mexican audience, which \u201ccomprised 75% of the market at the time,\u201d didn't turn on the TV to watch the show because \"they hated to see it in English.\u201d",
      "In response, the Latin Grammys transitioned to Spanish-language broadcasts in 2005, a transformative decision for its audience \u2014 and one that directly reflects the ways in which Latin music would be enjoyed in the years to come.",
      "The Latin Grammys will continue its global expansion by holding future awards shows in various international locations.",
      "Last year, the 2023 Latin Grammys were held in Seville, Spain, marking the first time the show took place outside the U.S.",
      "The move, facilitated by a nearly 19 million-euro deal between the government of Andalusia and the Latin Recording Academy, sparked some controversy, with some criticizing the Latin Grammys decision to hold the show in the very European country that colonized much of Latin America.",
      "Both Abud and Abaroa Jr. consider the Seville event a great success.",
      "\u201cIn the next couple of years, you will see another international edition of the Latin Grammys,\u201d said Abud.",

      "The adult male was found on Nov. 1 on a popular tourist beach in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia \u2014 about 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, according to a statement from the Western Australia state\u2019s Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.",

      "A healthy male can weigh more than 45 kilograms (100 pounds).",
      "The department said its efforts were focused on rehabilitating the penguin. Asked if the penguin could potentially be returned to Antarctica, the department replied that \u201coptions are still being worked through.\u201d",

      "There are few images more indelible in the history of American dance: Judith Jamison, regal and passionate in white leotard and long ruffled skirt, punching the air in \u201cCry\u201d \u2014 Alvin Ailey\u2019s piercing solo about Black womanhood",
      "NEW YORK -- There are few images more indelible in the history of American dance: Judith Jamison, regal and passionate in white leotard and long ruffled skirt, punching the air in \u201cCry\" \u2014 Alvin Ailey\u2019s piercing solo about Black womanhood.",
      "That searing 1971 piece made her an international star. But it was truly only the beginning of Jamison\u2019s decades-long career atop modern dance, onstage and off. As Ailey\u2019s hand-picked successor beginning in 1989, she led his namesake company for more than 20 years, helping it become the most successful modern dance troupe in the nation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Jamison, who died Saturday at 81 after a brief illness, reflected in an interview with The Associated Press in 2018, marking the company\u2019s then-60th anniversary. \u201cI find it remarkable that we still exist today,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think Mr. Ailey would be absolutely beside-himself happy, that something he started 60 years ago could blossom into everything he imagined.\u201d",
      "And likely much more. Jamison brought the company not only continued global exposure and crossover cultural appeal but economic stability and growth, putting it in \u201ca stratosphere that Ailey couldn\u2019t even imagine,\u201d said Wendy Perron, author and former longtime editor of Dance Magazine.",
      "Perron attributes Jamison\u2019s success, in a world when many dance companies struggle to survive, to her unique personality and ability to forge relationships. \u201cThere was a warmth and magnetism about her \u2014 everyone wanted to be with her,\u201d said Perron. \u201cThere was a light shining around her.\u201d",
      "Taking the reins as artistic director upon Ailey\u2019s death at 58, Jamison introduced new works and choreography, but also made sure to keep front and center her predecessor's undisputed masterpiece: \u201cRevelations,\u201d a 1960 classic that has defined the company and powered its success like few others, if any, in the history of dance.",
      "It was in \u201cRevelations,\u201d a telling of Black history through spirituals and blues, that Jamison also made a mark as a dancer, holding a white parasol with one arm as she undulated the rest of her body in a baptismal scene \u2013 \u201cthe umbrella woman,\u201d as the part became known.",
      "To this day, \u201cRevelations\u201d appears on most of the company\u2019s programs, at home in New York and on tour, and is referred to as the most-seen work of modern dance. (It's hard to conceive of anything comparable.) \u201cRevelations\u201d was even performed at the White House, at a dance event hosted by Michelle Obama in 2010, in which the first lady paid tribute to Jamison, calling her \u201can amazing, phenomenal, \u2018fly\u2019 woman.\u201d",
      "Obama also told Jamison from the stage that a photo of her in \u201cCry\u201d had been \u201cthe only piece of art\u201d in the Obamas' home before the White House, and that her daughters, Malia and Sasha, had asked her: \u201cIs that the lady in the picture?\u201d",
      "A year later, retiring as artistic director, Jamison exclaimed to a cheering crowd at New York City Center gathered to honor her: \u201cI have come a long way from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania!\u201d That\u2019s where Jamison was born in 1943 and raised, her childhood spent training in various dance forms, including ballet, modern and tap.",
      "\u201cI knew I had so much energy back then \u2013 just too much for everybody,\u201d she quipped in a 2023 podcast interview. \u201cBut my parents went, \u2018OK, lets direct her this way.\u2019\u201d She credited her mother\u2019s dedication \u2014 she made her daughter\u2019s costumes, and \u201cwould massage my legs when I got home from class.\u201d",
      "In 1964, famed choreographer Agnes de Mille had seen Jamison in a class and brought her to New York to participate in a production of American Ballet Theatre. Soon after, the young dancer went to an audition for a TV special \u2014 and flubbed it, she said. But Ailey was there, and she soon was invited to join his fledgling company.",
      "She wasn\u2019t sure what he saw in her, she has said, other than a look: \u201cSmall head, broad shoulders, long arms and long legs.\u201d",
      "With the young company, Jamison traveled to Europe and Africa. Even then, it took her a few years to appreciate that this could be a career. Partly this was because, as she noted in the 2023 podcast, \u201cWe were getting paid doodly-squat\u201d \u2013 envelopes that sometimes contained a $20 bill, and sometimes just a thank-you note.",
      "But she soon realized that she loved dancing, traveling and being around other dancers. The Ailey troupe was also a rare outlet at the time for Black talent. \u201cThere were no outlets,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no place for us to say, \"Hey look, this is our artistry, this is our culture, and guess what else we can do?\u201d",
      "Ailey chose Jamison for \u201cCry\u201d in 1971, a work he dedicated to Black women everywhere, but especially mothers. On opening night, Jamison has said, she didn\u2019t know if she was going to make it though the demanding, 16-minute solo.",
      "She told the Hollywood Reporter that \u201cwhen the curtain went down, I was on the floor.\u201d She got up to take a bow, \u201cand I kept taking bows over and over until I don\u2019t know which number it was, but they were still screaming and yelling.\u201d",
      "Over the next two decades, Jamison often appeared as a guest artist with companies around the world, and left the Ailey troupe in 1980 to star on Broadway in \u201cSophisticated Ladies.\" She also formed her own company, The Jamison Project.",
      "Then an ailing Ailey told her he\u2019d like her to run the company after him.",
      "Jamison recalled, in the AP interview in 2018, being present as Ailey died, along with fellow dancer Sylvia Waters and Ailey\u2019s mother.",
      "\u201cWe were in his room as he passed, and usually you see in movies, that people have their last breath and they breathe out. But Mr. Ailey breathed IN. We expected him to breathe out, and he didn\u2019t. So I think what we\u2019re living on now, is his breath OUT ... that air, that vision, that dream.\u201d",
      "Among her many laurels, Jamison was awarded Kennedy Center Honors in 1999 and a National Medal of the Arts in 2001.",
      "Perron, the former Dance Magazine editor, said she felt Jamison had been overlooked somewhat as a choreographer. She pointed to \u201cA Case of You\u201d \u2014 a duet to Diana Krall\u2019s version of the Joni Mitchell classic and part of Jamison\u2019s 2005 \u201cReminiscin.'\" The duet, Perron said, was \u201chappy and sad and passionate and inventive .. you really believe these people are passionately in love.\u201d",
      "Jamison passed the artistic director baton to choreographer Robert Battle in 2011. Looking back, she has said one of her proudest moments at the company was the creation of the Joan Weill Center for Dance in 2005, a midtown Manhattan home for the company.",
      "\u201cMajestic\u201d and \u201cqueenly\u201d is how Waters, now Ailey II Artistic Director Emerita, described her late colleague.",
      "\u201cShe was a unique, spectacular dancer,\" Waters said. \u201cTo dance with her and to be in her sphere of energy was mesmerizing.\"",

Though \u201cHeretic\u201d has been critically acclaimed for the darkest turn yet by Grant, audiences were less impressed, giving it a \u201cC+\u201d CinemaScore.

      "The group criticized one of the fantasy novel's subplots, which tells the story of an Indigenous girl living in foster care, for contributing to the \u201cerasure, trivialisation, and stereotyping of First Nations peoples and experiences.\"",
      "In a statement, Oliver, 49, said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d to have caused offense and apologized \u201cwholeheartedly.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was never my intention to misinterpret this deeply painful issue,\" he said. \"Together with my publishers we have decided to withdraw the book from sale.\u201d",
      "Indigenous campaigners were particularly aghast that neither Oliver nor his publishers, Penguin Random House, had consulted with them before the novel was published.",
      "\u201cIt is clear that our publishing standards fell short on this occasion, and we must learn from that and take decisive action,\u201d the publisher said. \"With that in mind, we have agreed with our author, Jamie Oliver, that we will be withdrawing the book from sale.\u201d",

      "Remembrance Sunday is a totemic event in the U.K., with the monarch leading senior royals, political leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his eight living predecessors, and envoys from the Commonwealth countries in laying wreaths at the Cenotaph, the Portland stone memorial that serves as the focal point for honoring the nation\u2019s war dead.",
      "The service is held on the second Sunday of November to mark the signing of the armistice to end World War I \u201con the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\u201d in 1918. Across the U.K., services are conducted at the same time in memory of the dead.",

      "Dressed in somber black, his wife, Kate, watched on from a balcony of the nearby Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, as is tradition. Queen Camilla, who would normally be standing next to the princess, wasn't present as she recovered from a chest infection.",
      "It's the first time since the start of the year that Kate carried out two consecutive days of public official engagements. On Saturday, she attended the Royal British Legion Festival Of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "Following the wreath-laying, around 10,000 veterans, including those who have fought in wars this century, notably in Afghanistan and Iraq, marched past the Cenotaph. With the passage of time, there were only a handful of World War II veterans present.",

      "\u201cThey never came home, and I always feel it\u2019s my duty to put in an appearance and thank God for those that did survive, and to pray for the ones who didn\u2019t,\" said Ford, who was one of 38 survivors.",
      "Charles\u2019 ceremonial role as commander in chief of the armed forces is a holdover from the days when the monarch led his troops into battle. But the link between the monarchy and the military is still very strong, with service members taking an oath of allegiance to the king and members of the royal family supporting service personnel through a variety of charities. Charles and William served on active duty in the military before taking up full-time royal duties.",
      "Charles was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February, forcing him to step away from public appearances for two months as he focused on his treatment and recovery. Just a few weeks later, Kate announced her own cancer diagnosis, which sidelined her for much of the year as she underwent chemotherapy.",
      "The king has been in good form in recent months and recently completed a taxing trip to Australia and Samoa. Kate, who made her first post-diagnosis public appearance during the monarch's birthday parade in June, is slowly returning to public duties.",
      "Prince William reflected this week on the strain that the cancer scare has placed on the royal family.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so proud of my wife, I\u2019m proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done,\u201d William told reporters on Thursday as he wrapped up a four-day trip to South Africa. \u201cBut from a personal family point of view, it\u2019s been, yeah, it\u2019s been brutal.\u201d",
      "While the Cenotaph was the focus of the national remembrance service, communities throughout the U.K. held their own ceremonies on Sunday.",
      "Needham-Crofton, who served with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers before a truck accident ended his military career, planned to attend a local service in Eastbourne on the south coast of England.",
      "He has spent much of his time honoring veterans and trying to help them, including 20 years as a volunteer for the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans. Like some of his army tasks, raising cash was rather grueling as it involved standing in front of London subway stations collecting coins to help fund the group\u2019s efforts.",
      "\u201cI like to respect all the veterans and do what I can for them,\" he told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s a brotherhood really. Even if you don\u2019t know a veteran that you meet, you feel a kinship toward them. That is very important to me. I shall be like that for the rest of my life.\""

      "Tall, graceful and expressive, she became one of the company's most famous performers and a muse for Ailey. Jamison had star turns in two of Ailey's signature dances, \u201cRevelations\u201d and \u201cCry.\u201d She danced with the Ailey company for 15 years before leaving to perform on Broadway and as a guest artist with other ballet companies.",

      "A bouncy labradoodle and a Kansas City-area program helped her get back on her feet.",
      "Dogs 4 Valor, operated through the Olathe, Kansas-based organization called The Battle Within, helps retired veterans and first responders work with their service dogs to help manage depression, anxiety and other challenges.",
      "\u201cA lot of times the veteran with severe PTSD is homebound,\u201d said Sandra Sindeldecker, program manager for Dogs 4 Valor. \u201cThey\u2019re isolated. They\u2019re very nervous. They won\u2019t make eye contact. Some won\u2019t leave the house at all.\u201d",
      "The program involves both group and one-on-one training. The goal is to get the veteran and the dog comfortable with each other and understanding each other. The group takes outings to help the veterans regain their footing in public places like airports. Program leaders also provide mental health therapy at no cost.",
      "The veterans and dogs graduate in six to nine months, but group gatherings continue.",
      "There is growing evidence of the value of service dogs for veterans with PTSD. A small study published in JAMA Network Open in June looked at a program operated by K9s For Warriors. Service dogs in the program are taught to pick up a veteran\u2019s physical signs of distress and can interrupt panic attacks and nightmares with a loving nudge.",
      "Researchers compared 81 veterans who received service dogs with 75 veterans on the waiting list for a trained dog. After three months, PTSD symptoms improved in both groups, but the veterans with dogs saw a bigger improvement on average.",
      "O'Brien, 40, recalled that the camp where she worked in Iraq sometimes had over 20,000 detainees. Violence and rioting were common and it left her with severe anxiety.",
      "\u201cWhen I got out of the military, I just assumed that you\u2019re supposed to be on edge all the time as a veteran,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "O\u2019Brien\u2019s mother spotted the frisky lab-poodle mix on Facebook and convinced her daughter to adopt the dog she named Albus. Months later, O'Brien learned about Dogs 4 Valor, and the pair joined the program in October 2023.",
      "O\u2019Brien says she can now go out in public again \u2014 she even went on vacation to Branson, Missouri, \u201cthings that I never would have thought I would do really, probably ever again.\u201d",
      "Mark Atkinson, 38, served in Afghanistan as a corporal in the Marine Corps. He returned home with PTSD and major depressive disorder, causing sleeplessness and anxiety. He adopted Lexi, now 5, in 2020.",
      "Lexi, a muscular cane corso breed, needed Atkinson as much as he needed her. Her previous owner had kept Lexi in chains before surrendering her. Since joining Dogs 4 Valor, the two can get out together and enjoy life.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really like leaving the house because I\u2019m safe there, you know?\" Atkinson said. \u201cAnd having Lexi has just made me get out to be more social.\u201d",
      "Having a group of fellow veterans facing the same challenges has also helped, Atkinson said.",
      "\u201cWe come from the same backgrounds, different branches,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cSame issues. You know, PTSD or traumatic brain injuries. And they\u2019re all very welcoming, as well. There\u2019s no judgment.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Brien compared living with Albus to a relationship with a sometimes pushy best friend who often wants to go out.",
      "\u201cThe best friend constantly wants to make you do things that make you nervous,\u201d O\u2019Brien laughed, acknowledging that it is ultimately up to her.",
      "\u201cI have to decide to walk out and just deal with life,\" O'Brien said. \"And so that has been hard. And it still is hard from time to time, but it\u2019s it\u2019s getting manageable.\u201d",
      "Some veterans said their family relationships have improved since they started the program.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m able to talk, not fly off the handle and just get along with people and not be as stressed, not have as much anxiety,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cOr even if I do, she (Lexi) is right there with me.\u201d",
      "Timothy Siebenmorgen, 61, said his relationships also are better with help from his 1-year-old American bulldog, Rosie, and Dogs 4 Valor, which he joined in July. He served in both the Marines and the Army, deploying 18 times.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re in the military, kind of taught not to show weakness,\" Siebenmorgen said. \"So you figure you can tackle everything yourself and you honestly believe that. And then you realize you can\u2019t do it on your own.\u201d",
      "Veterans said the dogs, and the program, have given them new hope and a renewed ability to move forward.",

      "LONDON -- Cases of mpox in the region of Congo where a new and more infectious variant was first detected appear to be \u201cplateauing,\u201d the World Health Organization said on Monday, even as the virus continues to increase in other areas of the country, as well as in Burundi and Uganda.",
      "A report by the U.N. health agency said the number of mpox infections \u201cshows a general rising trend,\u201d but that they may have plateaued in South Kivu, where the more infectious form of mpox was first identified to be spreading earlier this year among sex workers and miners in the gold mining town of Kamituga.",
      "WHO acknowledged that testing is still not widespread, making it difficult to understand how exactly the virus is spreading.",
      "According to data from last week, Congo reported fewer than 100 laboratory-confirmed mpox cases, down from nearly 400 in July. In recent weeks, experts say that infections appear to be stabilizing, offering a chance for health authorities to definitively stamp out the outbreak.",
      "So far, about 50,000 people in Congo have been immunized against mpox. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 3 million vaccines are needed to stop the outbreak.",
      "Last week, Africa CDC's director Dr. Jean Kaseya said the continent was \u201cstill in the acute phase\u201d of the mpox epidemic, with 19 countries affected. He warned that without more resources, the virus could become a global threat.",
      "WHO said the Burundi outbreak is also being driven by the newer variant, which causes less severe symptoms \u2014 meaning people who are infectious may not realize they are spreading it. In the last two weeks, Burundi has reported more than 200 new mpox cases every week, mostly in children and young adults.",
      "In Uganda, which reported 100 new cases last week, WHO said the virus is spreading mostly through sex, with the vast majority of cases in adults.",
      "Mpox -- previously known as monkeypox because it was first seen in research monkeys \u2014 is spread primarily through close skin-to-skin contact with infected people or their soiled clothes or bedsheets. It often causes visible skin lesions that could make people less likely to be in close contact with others.",
      "In August, WHO declared the rapid spread of mpox in Congo and elsewhere in Africa to be a global health emergency. To date, Africa has reported more than 46,000 suspected cases, including 1,081 deaths.",
      "WHO said it would convene an expert meeting on Nov. 22 to determine if mpox still constitutes an international emergency.",
      "Last week, Britain announced the first instance of the more infectious kind of mpox spreading beyond Africa. It identified mpox in a person who had recently traveled to Africa and in three of their household contacts. All the individuals are currently being treated in two London hospitals.",

      "Four-year-old Hussein Mikdad survived an Israeli airstrike on his home in a Beirut suburb last month",
      "BEIRUT -- Curled up in his father \u2019s lap, clinging to his chest, Hussein Mikdad cried his heart out. The 4-year-old kicked his doctor with his intact foot and pushed him away with the arm that was not in a cast. \u201cMy Dad! My Dad!\" Hussein said. \"Make him leave me alone!\u201d With eyes tearing up in relief and pain, the father reassured his son and pulled him closer.",
      "Hussein and his father, Hassan, are the only survivors of their family after an Israeli airstrike last month on their Beirut neighborhood. The strike killed 18 people, including his mother, three siblings and six relatives.",
      "\u201cCan he now shower?\u201d the father asked the doctor.",
      "Ten days after surgery, doctors examining Hussein's wounds said the boy is healing properly. He has rods in his fractured right thigh and stitches that assembled his torn tendons back in place on the right arm. The pain has subsided, and Hussein should be able to walk again in two months \u2014 albeit with a lingering limp.",
      "A prognosis for Hussein's invisible wounds is much harder to give. He is back in diapers and has begun wetting his bed. He hardly speaks and has not said a word about his mother, two sisters and brother.",
      "\u201cThe trauma is not just on the muscular skeletal aspect. But he is also mentally hurt,\u201d Imad Nahle, one of Hussein\u2019s orthopedic surgeons, said.",
      "Israel said, without elaborating, that the strike on the Mikdad neighborhood struck a Hezbollah target. In the war that has escalated since September, Israeli airstrikes have increasingly hit residential areas around Lebanon. Israel accuses the Lebanese militant group of hiding its capabilities and fighters among civilians. It vows to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "But children have been caught in the midst.",
      "With more strikes on homes and in residential areas, doctors are seeing more children affected by the violence. More than 100 children have been killed in Lebanon in the past six weeks and hundreds injured. And of the 14,000 wounded since last year, around 10% are children. Many have been left with severed limbs, burned bodies, and broken families \u2014 scars that could last for a lifetime.",
      "Ghassan Abu Sittah, a renowned British-Palestinian surgeon who is also treating Hussein, sees that long road ahead. This is his worry: \u201cIt leaves us with a generation of physically wounded children, children who are psychologically and emotionally wounded.\"",
      "At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which is receiving limited cases of war casualties, Nahle said he operated on five children in the past five weeks \u2014 up from no cases before. Most were referred from south and eastern Lebanon.",
      "A few miles away, at the Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui, one of the country\u2019s largest burns centers increased its capacity by nearly 180% since September so it could accommodate more war wounded, its medical director Naji Abirached said. About a fifth of the newly admitted patients are children.",
      "In one of the burn center\u2019s ICU units lies Ivana Skakye. She turned 2 in the hospital ward last week. Ivana has been healing from burns she sustained following an Israeli airstrike outside their home in southern Lebanon on Sept. 23. Israel said it struck ammunition depots and launchers in southern Lebanon that day when its warplanes launched hundreds of airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, making it the deadliest day of the war so far. More than 500 people were killed.",
      "Six weeks later, the tiny Ivana remains wrapped in white gauze from head to toe except her torso. She sustained third-degree burns over 40 percent of her body. Her hair and head, her left side all the way to her legs, both her arms and her chest were burned. Her family home was damaged, its ceiling set afire. The family\u2019s valuables, packed in their car as they prepared to leave, were also torched. Ivana\u2019s older sister, Rahaf, 7, has recovered faster from burns to her face and hands.",
      "Fatima Zayoun, their mother, was in the kitchen when the explosion hit. Zayoun jumped up to grab the girls, who were playing on the terrace.",
      "It was, Zayoun said, \"as if something lifted me up so that I can grab my kids. I have no idea how I managed to pull them in and throw them out of the window. She spoke from the ICU burns unit. \u201cThey were not on fire, but they were burned. Black ash covered them. ... (Ivana) was without any hair. I told myself, `That is not her.'\u201d",
      "Now, Ivana's wound dressings are changed every two days. Her doctor, Ziad Sleiman, said she could be discharged in a few days. She\u2019s back again to saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cBye \u2014 shorthand for wanting to go out.",
      "Like Hussein, though, Ivana has no home to return to. Her parents fear collective shelters could cause an infection to return.",
      "After seeing her kids \u201csizzling on the floor,\u201d Zayoun, 35, said that even if their home is repaired, she wouldn\u2019t want to return. \u201cI saw death with my own eyes,\u201d she said.",
      "Zayoun was 17 last time Israel and Hezbollah were at war, in 2006. Displaced with her family then, she said she almost enjoyed the experience, riding out of their village in a truck full of their belongings, mixing with new people, learning new things. They returned home when the war was over.",
      "\u201cBut this war is hard. They are hitting everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do they want from us? Do they want to hurt our children? We are not what they are looking for.\"",
      "Abu Sittah, the reconstructive surgeon, said most of the children's injuries are from blasts or collapsing rubble. That attack on a space they expect to be inviolable can have lingering effects.",
      "\u201cChildren feel safe at home,\" he said. \"The injury makes them for the first time lose that sense of security \u2014 that their parents are keeping them safe, that their homes are invincible, and suddenly their homes become not so.\u201d",
      "One recent morning, children were playing in the courtyard of a vocational school-turned-shelter in Dekwaneh, north of Beirut, where nearly 3,000 people displaced from the south are now living. The parents were busy with an overflowing bathroom that serves one floor in a building that houses nearly 700 people.",
      "Only playtime brings the children, from different villages in the south, together. They were divided in two teams, ages ranging between 6 and 12, competing to get the handkerchief first. A tiny girl hugged and held hands with strangers visiting the shelter. \u201cI am from Lebanon. Don't tell anyone,\u201d she whispered in their ears.",
      "The game turned rowdy when two girls in their early teens got into a fist fight. Pushing and shoving began. Tears and tantrums followed. The tiny girl walked away in a daze.",
      "Maria Elizabeth Haddad, manager of the psychosocial support programs in Beirut and neighboring areas for the U.S.-based International Medical Corps, said parents in shelters reported signs of increased anxiety, hostility and aggression among kids. They talk back to parents and ignore rules. Some have developed speech impediments and clinginess. One is showing early signs of psychosis.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be residual symptoms when they grow up, especially related to attachment ties, to feeling of security,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cIt is a generational trauma. We have experienced it before with our parents. ... They don\u2019t have stability or search for (extra) stability. This is not going to be easy to overcome.\u201d",
      "Children represent more than a third of over 1 million people displaced by the war in Lebanon and following Israeli evacuation notices, according to U.N. and government estimates (more than 60,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel). That leaves hundreds of thousands in Lebanon without schooling, either because their schools were inaccessible or have been turned into shelters.",
      "Hussein's father says he and his son must start together from scratch. With help from relatives, the two have found a temporary shelter in a home \u2014 and, for the father, a brief sense of relief. \u201cI thank God he is not asking for or about his mother and his siblings,\u201d said Hassan Mikdad, the 40-year-old father.",
      "He has no explanation for his son, who watched their family die in their home. His two sisters \u2014 Celine, 10, and Cila, 14 \u2014 were pulled out of the rubble the following day. His mother, Mona, was pulled out three days later. She was locked in an embrace with her 6-year-old son, Ali.",
      "The strike on Oct. 21 also caused damage across the street, to one of Beirut\u2019s main public hospitals, breaking solar panels and windows in the pharmacy and the dialysis unit. The father survived because he had stepped out for coffee. He watched his building crumble in the late-night airstrike. He also lost his shop, his motorcycles and car \u2014 all the evidence of his 16 years of family life.",
      "His friend, Hussein Hammoud, arrived on the scene to help sift through rubble. Hammoud spotted young Hussein Mikdad\u2019s fingers in the darkness in an alley behind their home. At first, he thought they were severed limbs \u2014 until he heard the boy\u2019s screams. He dug out Hussein with glass lodged in his leg and a metal bar in his shoulder. Hammoud said he didn\u2019t recognize the boy. He held the child's almost-severed wrist in place.",
      "In the hospital now, Hussein Mikdad sipped a juice as he listened to his father and his friend. His father turned to him, asking if he wanted a Spider-Man toy \u2014 an effort to forestall a new outburst of tears. He said he buys Hussein a toy each day.",
      "\u201cWhat I am living through seems like a big lie. ...The mind can\u2019t comprehend,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank God for the blessing that is Hussein.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 20:10:31 -0500",

      "An attorney representing a conservate prosecutor is struggling to convince Wisconsin's liberal-leaning Supreme Court to reactivate the state's 175-year-old abortion ban",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A conservative prosecutor's attorney struggled Monday to persuade the Wisconsin Supreme Court to reactivate the state's 175-year-old abortion ban, drawing a tongue-lashing from two of the court's liberal justices during oral arguments.",
      "Sheboygan County\u2019s Republican district attorney, Joel Urmanski, has asked the high court to overturn a Dane County judge\u2019s ruling last year that invalidated the ban. A ruling isn't expected for weeks but abortion advocates almost certainly will win the case given that liberal justices control the court. One of them, Janet Protasiewicz, remarked on the campaign trail that she supports abortion rights.",
      "Monday's two-hour session amounted to little more than political theater. Liberal Justice Rebecca Dallet told Urmanski's attorney, Matthew Thome, that the ban was passed in 1849 by white men who held all the power and that he was ignoring everything that has happened since. Jill Karofsky, another liberal justice, pointed out that the ban provides no exceptions for rape or incest and that reactivation could result in doctors withholding medical care. She told Thome that he was essentially asking the court to sign a \u201cdeath warrant\u201d for women and children in Wisconsin.",
      "\u201cThis is the world gone mad,\u201d Karofsky said.",
      "The ban stood until 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide nullified it. Legislators never repealed the ban, however, and conservatives have argued the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe two years ago reactivated it.",
      "Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit challenging the law in 2022. He argued that a 1985 Wisconsin law that prohibits abortion after a fetus reaches the point where it can survive outside the womb supersedes the ban. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation.",
      "Urmanski contends that the ban was never repealed and that it can co-exist with the 1985 law because that law didn\u2019t legalize abortion at any point. Other modern-day abortion restrictions also don\u2019t legalize the practice, he argues.",
      "Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled last year that the ban outlaws feticide \u2014 which she defined as the killing of a fetus without the mother\u2019s consent \u2014 but not consensual abortions. The ruling emboldened Planned Parenthood to resume offering abortions in Wisconsin after halting procedures after Roe was overturned.",
      "Urmanski asked the state Supreme Court in February to overturn Schlipper\u2019s ruling without waiting for a lower appellate decision.",
      "Thome told the justices on Monday that he wasn't arguing about the implications of reactivating the ban. He maintained that the legal theory that new laws implicitly repeal old ones is shaky. He also contended that the ban and the newer abortion restrictions can overlap just like laws establishing different penalties for the same crime. A ruling that the 1985 law effectively repealed the ban would be \u201canti-democratic,\u201d Thome added.",
      "\u201cIt's a statute this Legislature has not repealed and you're saying, no, you actually repealed it,\u201d he said.",
      "Dallet shot back that disregarding laws passed over the last 40 years to go back to 1849 would be undemocratic.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed a separate lawsuit in February asking the state Supreme Court to rule directly on whether a constitutional right to abortion exists in the state. The justices have agreed to take the case but haven't scheduled oral arguments yet.",

    "story": [
      "Anti-abortion advocates say they will quickly dismantle some of President Joe Biden's abortion policies once President-elect Donald Trump makes his return to the White House next year",
      "WASHINGTON -- Anti-abortion advocates say there is still work to be done to further restrict access to abortion when Republican Donald Trump returns to the White House next year.",
      "They point to the federal guidance that the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden released around emergency abortions, requiring that hospitals provide them for women whose health or life is at risk, and its easing of prescribing restrictions for abortion pills that have allowed women to order the medication online with the click of a button.",
      "\u201cNow the work begins to dismantle the pro-abortion policies of the Biden-Harris administration,\" the Susan B. Anthony List, the powerful anti-abortion lobby, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s first-term pro-life accomplishments are the baseline for his second term.\u201d",
      "The group declined to release details about what, specifically, they will seek to undo. But abortion rights advocates are bracing for further abortion restrictions once Trump takes office. And some women are, too, with online abortion pill orders spiking in the days after Election Day.",
      "Trump has said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government. Yet, during the campaign, he pointedly noted that he appointed justices to the Supreme Court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion. And there are things his administration can do, from picking judges to issuing regulations, to further an anti-abortion agenda.",
      "The Trump administration is expected to pull back Biden's controversial directive that requires emergency rooms to provide abortions when necessary to stabilize a woman's health or life. The Biden administration had argued that the decades-old federal law, which requires hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment for patients in exchange for Medicare funding, also applies in cases where an abortion might be needed.",
      "Reports of women being sent home or left untreated by hospitals in dangerous scenarios have proliferated across the United States since the Supreme Court overturned the national right to an abortion in 2022. In some cases, hospitals said state abortion bans had stopped them from terminating a pregnancy.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing the lives of pregnant people be put in jeopardy,\" Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said Wednesday. \"We're seeing women who have become infertile, who have been subject to sepsis and we're now hearing reports with death.\"",
      "Even if a Trump administration abandons the guidance of the law, Goss Graves said advocacy groups like hers will continue a legal fight for the Biden administration's interpretation of the law.",
      "Some doctors and hospitals also have said the federal guidance offered a protection for them to perform emergency abortions in states like Idaho and Texas, where threat of prosecution for performing an abortion hangs over their decision-making.",
      "Trump has said he supports exceptions for rape and incest cases, as well as when a woman's life is at risk. But he has not gone as far as saying he supports exemptions when a woman's health is on the line.",
      "Abortions might be necessary to prevent organ loss, significant hemorrhage or dangerous infections for pregnant women in rare but serious scenarios. In cases like ectopic pregnancy, premature rupture of membranes and placental abruptions, a fetus might still be alive but continuing the pregnancy can be detrimental. Doctors have argued that the legal gray area has put them in a bind.",
      "In Idaho, for example, one hospital resorted to airlifting women out of the state after a strict abortion ban, which only allowed for abortions to prevent a woman's death, was enacted.",
      "The Biden administration sued Idaho, arguing its state law conflicted with federal law requiring hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment, which might include abortions, for patients. The state amended its law to allow abortions for ectopic pregnancies, but other dangerous scenarios still remain unaccounted for. The Supreme Court declined to address the issue earlier this year, issuing a limited order that cleared the way for hospitals to provide emergency abortions while the case worked its way through lower courts.",
      "Enforcement of the federal law, however, is on hold in Texas, which challenged the Biden administration's guidance on emergency abortions.",
      "A patchwork of state laws governing abortion will remain in place under the Trump administration. Voters in Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota on Tuesday defeated constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "In Missouri, however, voters approved a ballot measure on Tuesday to undo one of the nation's strictest bans. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect.",
      "The ease with which women have been able to get abortion pills could also be up for reconsideration under Trump.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration made it easier to obtain abortion pills, including mifepristone, allowing women to access the medication over telehealth. The agency has approved the drug's safety through 10 weeks of pregnancy, saying that adverse effects happen for .32% of patients.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates have challenged that, arguing the medications are not safe and at the very least not fit for eased access without in-person supervision by a doctor.",
      "Although the Supreme Court preserved access to the drug earlier this year, anti-abortion advocates and conservative states have renewed their challenge in lower courts.",
      "Some women are worried. Telehealth company Wisp saw an immediate spike in abortion pill orders between Election Day and the following day, with a 600% increase. In states like Florida and Texas, where the medication cannot be legally shipped, the company saw a nearly 1000% percent increase in orders of so-called \u201cmorning after\u201d pills, also known as emergency contraception.",
      "The company fills about tens of thousands of orders monthly for reproductive products including birth control pills and abortion pills, CEO Monica Cepak told the Associated Press.",
      "Right now women typically take a two-step regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol to complete a medication abortion. Cepak said the company will keep a \u201cclose eye\u201d on mifepristone under a Trump administration and is prepared to shift to a misoprostol-only regimen should restriction to mifepristone be implemented.",
      "But Trump could be a wild card on the issue, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis who is an expert on reproductive health issues. In the final months of the campaign, he backed away from a more rigid stance on abortion \u2014 even saying he would not sign a national abortion ban if it came across his desk.",
      "Although he has enjoyed firm backing from anti-abortion groups, he is willing to break with allies when he wants.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a clear sense from him about what he would do,\u201d Ziegler said.",

      "The majority of strokes could be prevented, according to new guidelines aimed at helping people and their doctors do just that.",
      "Stroke was the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than half a million Americans have a stroke every year. But up to 80% of strokes may be preventable with better nutrition, exercise and identification of risk factors.",
      "The first new guidelines on stroke prevention in 10 years from the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association, include recommendations for people and doctors that reflect a better understanding of who gets strokes and why, along with new drugs that can help reduce risk.",
      "The good news is that the best way to reduce your risk for stroke is also the best way to reduce your risk for a whole host of health problems \u2014 eat a healthy diet, move your body and don't smoke. The bad news is that it's not always so easy to sustain.",
      "Dr. Sean Duke, a stroke doctor at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, blames the forces in society that keep people sedentary and eating poorly, like cell phones and cheap, unhealthy food. \u201cOur world is stacked against us,\u201d he said.",
      "Here's what to know about stroke and the new guidelines:",
      "A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked or if a blood vessel in the brain bursts. That deprives the brain of oxygen which can cause brain damage that can lead to difficulty thinking, talking and walking, or even death.",
      "Eating healthy can help control several factors that increase your risk for stroke, including high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and obesity, according to the heart association.",
      "The group recommends foods in the so-called Mediterranean diet such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and olive oil, which can help keep cholesterol levels down. It suggests limiting red meat and other sources of saturated fat. Instead, get your protein from beans, nuts, poultry, fish and seafood.",
      "Limit highly processed foods and foods and drinks with a lot of added sugar. This can also reduce your calorie intake, which helps keep weight in check.",
      "Getting up and walking around for at least 10 minutes a day can \u201cdrastically\u201d reduce your risk, said Dr. Cheryl Bushnell, a neurologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine who was part of the group that came up with the new guidelines. Among the many benefits: Regular exercise can help reduce blood pressure, a major risk factor for stroke.",
      "Of course, more is better: The heart association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic or 75 minutes of vigorous activity \u2014 or some combination \u2014 per week. How you do it doesn't matter so much, experts said: Go to the gym, take a walk or run in your neighborhood or use treadmills or stepper machines at home.",
      "Diet and exercise can help control weight, another important risk factor for strokes. But a new class of drugs that can drastically reduce weight have been approved by regulators, providing new tools to reduce stroke risk since guidelines were last updated.",
      "The guidelines now recommend that doctors consider prescribing these drugs, including those sold under the brand names Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, to people with obesity or diabetes.",
      "But while those drugs can help, people still need to eat well and get exercise, cautions Dr. Fadi Nahab, a stroke expert at Emory University Hospital.",
      "The new guidelines for the first time recommend doctors screen patients for other factors that could increase stroke risk, including sex and gender and non-medical factors such as economic stability, access to health care, discrimination and racism. For example, the risk for having a first stroke is nearly twice as high for Black adults in the U.S. as it is for white adults, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cIf somebody doesn\u2019t have insurance or they can\u2019t get to a doctor\u2019s office because of transportation issues or they can\u2019t get off work to get health care ... these are all things that can impact the ability to prevent stroke,\" Bushnell said.",
      "Doctors may be able to point to resources for low-cost health care or food, and can give ideas about how to be active without breaking the bank for a gym membership.",
      "The guidelines also now recommend doctors should screen for conditions that could increase a woman's risk for stroke, such as high blood pressure during pregnancy or early menopause.",
      "Three of the most common stroke symptoms include face weakness, arm weakness and difficulty speaking. And time is important, because brain damage can happen quickly and damage can be limited if a stroke is treated quickly. Stroke experts have coined an acronym to help you remember: FAST. F for face, A for arm, S for speech, and T for time. If you think you or a loved one could be having a stroke, call 911 right away.",

      "LONDON -- British health officials say they have identified four cases of the new, more infectious version of mpox that first emerged in Congo, marking the first time the variant has caused a cluster of illness outside of Africa. Scientists said the risk to the public remains low.",
      "Authorities announced the first case of the new form of mpox in the U.K. last week, saying the case was being treated at a London hospital after recently traveling to countries in Africa with ongoing outbreaks.",
      "This week, the U.K. Health Security Agency said it had now identified three further cases who lived in the same household as the first patient. They too are now being treated at a hospital in London.",
      "\u201cMpox is very infectious in households with close contact and so it is not unexpected to see further cases within the same household,\u201d said Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor of the U.K. Health Security Agency.",
      "The new variant of mpox was first detected earlier this year in eastern Congo. Scientists believe it causes milder symptoms that are harder to notice, which makes it easier to spread because people may not know they are infected. Its spread in Congo and elsewhere in Africa prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency in August.",

    "story": [
      "Health officials say it's important to get flu and COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the holidays when respiratory bugs tend to spread",
      "WASHINGTON -- If you missed the early fall push for flu and COVID-19 vaccines, it's not too late.",
      "Health officials say it's important to get vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when respiratory bugs tend to spread with travel and indoor celebrations.",
      "Those viruses haven't caused much trouble so far this fall. But COVID-19 tends to jump in the winter months, a rise that usually starts around Thanksgiving and peaks in January.",
      "And that coincides with flu season, which tends to start in November or December and peak in January or February.",
      "It takes the body about two weeks to build up immunity after either shot \u2014 meaning vaccination is needed before these viruses start spreading. A lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.",
      "Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters \u2014 they're not just another dose of last year\u2019s protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body\u2019s immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains.",
      "While they\u2019re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 \u2014 or dying from it.",
      "\u201cIt may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cI would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.\u201d",
      "Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot.",
      "\u201cOur best defense to protect ourselves, our loved ones and all those around us is a simple shot,\u201d Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a recent statement.",
      "While it may have faded from the headlines, the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year.",
      "\u201cMaybe we believe that it\u2019s not going to be me but let\u2019s not take a chance,\u201d said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. \u201cWhy not get a vaccine that\u2019s going to help you reduce that risk?\u201d",
      "The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge.",
      "Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year.",
      "Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu \u2013 and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too.",
      "In addition, the CDC is recommending that people 65 and older get a second COVID-19 shot six months after their fall dose to boost their year-round protection, since the coronavirus isn't just a winter threat. People with weakened immune systems are eligible for extra doses, too.",
      "Last fall\u2019s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that\u2019s no longer spreading while this year\u2019s are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older.",
      "High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot.",
      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics \u2014 although next year it's set to be available for use at home.",
      "All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems.",
      "The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination \u2013 but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter.",
      "And while \u201cyour arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,\u201d it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said.",
      "The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.",
      "About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access. Call your local health department to ask about options.",
      "Check the government website, vaccines.gov, for availability at local pharmacies.",

      "Albania had prevented the Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A from docking early last week at the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital, Tirana, after a watchdog alerted authorities that it was carrying hazardous waste.",
      "Instead, the ship was kept at an anchorage place away from the port.",
      "The prosecutors then ordered the containers to be seized and stored \u201cat an environmentally\" safe place. Once unloaded, the containers are expected to be sent to an agency in Porto Romano, 6 kilometers (4 miles) away, for inspection.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s office has asked different institutions to conduct lab tests of the cargo.",
      "The Seattle-based non-government organization Basel Action Network, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, flagged the ship to authorities in August after receiving information from a whistleblower that the containers on board are suspected to be carrying an estimated 2,100 tons of toxic dust from pollution control filters from the steel industry.",
      "The dust is suspected to have originated at an Albanian company and that it was also illegally smuggled to Albania from neighboring Kosovo and Germany.",
      "BAN said the containers left Durres on July 4 on two Maersk-chartered ships with the intended destination of Thailand. The group said it alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment.",
      "Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the containers were loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said.",

      "Federal health officials are calling for more testing and treatment of workers on farms with bird flu",

      "Farmworkers in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered treatment even if they show no symptoms, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The new guidance comes after blood tests for 115 farmworkers in Michigan and Colorado showed that eight workers \u2014 or 7% \u2014 had antibodies that indicated previous infection with the virus known as Type A H5N1 influenza.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of these actions is to keep workers safe, to limit the transmission of H5 to humans and to reduce the possibility of the virus changing,\u201d Shah told reporters.",
      "The CDC study provides the largest window to date into how the bird virus first detected in March in dairy cows may be spreading to people. It suggests that the virus has infected more humans than the 46 farmworkers identified in the U.S. as of Thursday. Nearly all were in contact with infected dairy cows or infected poultry.",
      "Outside experts said it\u2019s notable that the study prompted the CDC to take new action. Previous recommendations called for testing and treating workers only when they had symptoms.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant move towards the assessment that these H5N1 viruses are a greater risk than the CDC estimated before,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "Every additional infection in animals or humans gives the virus the chance to change in potentially dangerous ways, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt shows yet again that we are not responding effectively to the H5N1 cattle outbreak in humans or animals and if we continue to let this virus spread and jump from species to species, our luck will eventually run out,\u201d Rasmussen said in an email.",
      "The CDC study included 45 workers in Michigan and 70 in Colorado tested between June and August. Of the eight workers with positive blood tests, four reported no symptoms. All eight cleaned milking parlors and none used respiratory protection such as face masks. Three said they used eye protection.",
      "High levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows, increasing the risk of exposure and infection, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said that efforts to monitor dairy workers for illness have been hindered by several barriers including the reluctance of farm owners and farmworkers to allow testing.",
      "Rasmussen and others have criticized the federal response to the outbreak as too slow and \u201clackluster.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese studies should have been performed months ago and should have been prioritized,\u201d she said.",
      "The virus has been confirmed in at least 446 cattle herds in 15 states. Last week, the Agriculture Department said a pig at an Oregon farm was confirmed to have bird flu, the first time the virus was detected in U.S. swine.",

      "Trent Russell, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, who worked at the time as a transplant coordinator for the Washington Regional Transplant Community and had access to hospital records all over the region, was convicted earlier this year of illegally accessing health care records and destroying or altering records at a jury trial.",
      "He was also charged with publishing that information on the internet in 2019, at a time when public speculation about Ginsburg's health and her ability to serve as a justice was a matter of public debate. Prosecutors said he posted the information along with a false claim that Ginsburg had already died. But the jury acquitted Russell on that count.",
      "Ginsburg served on the court until her death in 2020.",
      "Prosecutors said Russell disclosed the health records on forums that trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories, including conspiracy theories that Ginsburg was dead, but Russell's motivations for his actions were unclear. Indeed, Russell himself never admitted that he accessed the records, at one point suggesting that perhaps his cat walked across the keyboard in a way that mistakenly called up Ginsburg's data.",
      "Russell's excuses and refusal to accept responsibility prompted blistering critiques from prosecutors, who sought a 30-month sentence.",
      "\u201cHe offered completely implausible excuses with a straight face,\u201d prosecutor Zoe Bedell said.",
      "Russell's lawyer, Charles Burnham, sought a sentence of probation or home detention. He cited Russell's work saving lives as a transplant coordinator and his military record which included a deployment to Afghanistan as mitigating factors.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell has lived a quietly heroic life,\u201d Burnham wrote in court papers. He chalked up the criminal conduct to \u201cbeing stupid.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou chose to blame your cat,\u201d Nachmanoff said.",
      "The court records in the case are carefully redacted to remove any reference to Ginsburg, but during the trial and at Thursday's sentencing hearing, all sides openly acknowledged that Ginsburg was the victim of the privacy breach.",
      "Her status as a public figure, in fact, prompted a debate about the severity of Russell's crime. Prosecutors said her high public profile, in addition to her age and illness, made her a particularly vulnerable victim.",
      "\u201cHe went with the Supreme Court justice who was old, who was sick, and whose sickness was a public concern,\u201d Bedell argued.",
      "Russell's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that Ginsburg's high office and the power that comes with it is the opposite of vulnerability.",
      "Nachmanoff, in issuing his sentence, said he took into account the fact that Russell has a sick step parent who might need care. The judge noted \u201cwith some irony\u201d that the details of the stepparent's health problems are under seal.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because it is sensitive health information \u2014 a benefit you did not provide to Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he said.",

      "A British doctor who was disgruntled about his inheritance and tried to kill his mother\u2019s boyfriend by injecting him with a fake COVID-19 vaccine that was poison has been sentenced to 31 years in prison",
      "LONDON -- A British doctor who was disgruntled about his inheritance and tried to kill his mother\u2019s boyfriend by injecting him with a fake COVID-19 vaccine that was poison was sentenced Wednesday to 31 years in prison.",
      "Dr. Thomas Kwan disguised himself as a nurse making home virus booster visits to infect Patrick O\u2019Hara with a flesh-eating poison because he believed the older man stood in the way of him inheriting his mother's home some day.",
      "\u201cIt was an audacious plan to murder a man in plain sight and you very nearly succeeded,\u201d Justice Christina Lambert said. \u201cYou were certainly obsessed by money and more particularly, the money to which you considered yourself entitled.\"",
      "Kwan, 53, pleaded guilty last month in Newcastle Crown Court to attempted murder.",
      "O\u2019Hara, 72, survived after being in intensive care for several weeks and having part of his arm cut away to prevent the necrotizing fasciitis from spreading.",
      "The ordeal left him \u201ca shell of an individual,\u201d he said. O'Hara and Kwan's mother, Jenny Leung, have since split up.",
      "Police used surveillance camera footage to track down Kwan.",
      "They found he had hatched an elaborate plot by sending fake letters with National Health Service logos, hyperlinks and even a QR code to offer a home visit for a COVID booster to O'Hara. Kwan disguised himself in head-to-toe protective gear, tinted glasses and a surgical mask and drove a vehicle to the appointment in January using fake license plates.",
      "Kwan, who was described as having a morbid obsession with poisons, used iodomethane, a substance found in pesticides that he thought would be difficult for medics to detect, the judge said.",
      "Police found arsenic, liquid mercury and castor beans, which can be used to make the chemical weapon ricin, during a search of his home. He had instructions on how to make ricin on his computer.",
      "The judge said Kwan was upset about getting a smaller share of his inheritance when his father died. He had a strained relationship with his mother, and learned that she had a provision in her will that would allow O'Hara to stay in her home if she died before him.",
      "\"Your resentment and bitterness towards your mother and Mr. O\u2019Hara was all to do with money and your belief you were not being given money which you thought you were entitled to,\u201d Lambert said.",
      "O'Hara said justice had been served by the sentence."

      "The story of \u201cKing,\u201d who doesn't disclose his real name, is similar to that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cKing\u201d doesn\u2019t disclose his real name. Even clients of his Sao Paulo newsstand have to call him by his moniker. The Brazilian online sports gambling addict lowered his profile after a loan shark threatened to put bullets in his head if he didn\u2019t pay up.",
      "Broke and embarrassed, King sought treatment and support earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI was once addicted to slot machines, but then sports betting was so easy that I changed. I got carried away all the time,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "King\u2019s story is that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years. The country has become the third-biggest market in the world for sports betting, following the U.S. and the U.K., a report by data analysis company Comscore said last year. But unlike those countries, rampant advertising and sponsorship have been coupled with an unregulated market. The government is now \u2014 belatedly, some say \u2014 striving to get a handle on the epidemic.",
      "On a recent evening, King's Gamblers Anonymous meeting took place in an improvised classroom inside a church, with coffee and cookies to keep everyone awake, and supportive messages scrawled onto the blackboard. One that's become ubiquitous in Brazil and beyond: \u201cOnly for today I will avoid the first bet.\u201d",
      "King and other attendees, all Christian, started a prayer and the meeting began.",
      "King said his financial problems arose from his addiction to online sports betting, chiefly on soccer.",
      "\u201cI miss the adrenaline rush when I don\u2019t bet,\" he said before the gathering. \"I have managed to stop for a couple of months, but I know that if I do it once again, even a small bet, it will all come back.\u201d",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver for Brazilians embracing sports betting. King said he transformed almost every sale during that time into a bet. His hook was the non-stop advertising on TV, radio, social media as well as sponsorship of local soccer teams' jerseys. He asked for bank loans to pay his gambling debts and then, to cover those, went to the moneylender. His total debt now amounts to 85,000 reais ($15,000) \u2014 impossible to pay off with his monthly income of 8,000 reais.",
      "Digging oneself out of debt in Brazil is especially daunting with its sky-high interest rates. Loans from Brazilian banks could add interest of almost 8% per month to the borrowed sum, and from loan sharks could be even more.",
      "Four Gamblers Anonymous meetings attended by the AP in October featured discussions about difficulties paying down debts, forcing working-class members to postpone housing payments and cancel family vacations.",
      "Some members of impoverished Brazilian families have used welfare money for betting instead of paying for groceries and housing, official data suggests. In August, beneficiaries of Brazil\u2019s flagship program Bolsa Familia spent 3 billion reais ($530 million) on sports betting, according to a report from the central bank. That was more than 20% of the program\u2019s total outlay in the month.",
      "Sports betting was made legal in 2018 in a bill signed by former President Michel Temer. The subsequent turmoil has recently been setting off alarm bells, with addicts venting on social media and media reports of people losing huge sums.",
      "On Oct. 1, the economy ministry prevented more than 2,000 betting companies from operating in Brazil for having failed to provide all the required documents. Soccer-loving President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said in an interview on Oct. 17 that he will shut down the entire market in Brazil if his administration\u2019s new regulations \u2014 presented at the end of July\u2014 fail to work. And Brazil\u2019s Senate on Oct. 25 opened an investigation into betting companies, focusing on crime and addiction.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tax evasion, money laundering of organized crime, the use of influencers to trick people into betting. These companies need to be audited,\u201d Sen. Soraya Thronicke, who proposed the inquiry, told journalists in Brasilia.",
      "S\u00e9rgio Peixoto, a ride-sharing app driver in Rio, is one of many lower-middle-income Brazilians who have reduced their spending due to sports betting debt. Peixoto\u2019s debt currently amounts to 25,000 reais ($4,400). His monthly income is four times less than that.",
      "\u201cIt stopped being a game, it wasn\u2019t fun. I just wanted to get the money back, so I lost even more,\u201d said Peixoto, 26. \u201cI could have invested that money. It would surely have given me more benefits.",
      "Pressure on people to gamble is everywhere. Current and former soccer players, including Vinicius J\u00fanior, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio and Roberto Rivellino, are among the poster boys for local and foreign brands. All but one of the top-tier soccer clubs have betting companies among their main sponsors, with their name and logo emblazoned on their kits. There have been cases of kids and teenagers setting up accounts using their parents' personal information and money, multiple local media outlets have reported.",
      "Brazil's economy ministry estimates that Brazil's sports betting market had $21 billion in transactions last year, a 71% increase compared with the first year of the pandemic, 2020.",
      "The ministry's newly presented regulations include facial recognition systems for gamblers to bet, the identification of a single bank account for transactions involving sports betting, new protections against hackers and the government-authorized domain, bet.br, which will host all betting sites that are legal in Brazil. Once they are in place, come January, between 100 and 150 betting companies will continue to operate in the South American nation.",
      "The changes in Brazil have prompted some companies to take preemptive action. A report by Yield Sec, a technical intelligence platform for online marketplaces, said several betting companies voluntarily restricted their operations in different places after the latest editions of the European Championships and Copa America in the hopes of presenting \u201cthe best possible license application face to the Brazilian authorities.\u201d",
      "Magnho Jos\u00e9 Santos de Sousa, the president of the Legal Gambling Institute, a betting think tank, said Brazil has been flooded by some legal platforms that have licenses in Malta, Cura\u00e7ao, Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, and also illegal sites based in China.",
      "De Sousa expressed hope that the new regulations for advertising, responsible gambling and qualification of sports betting companies will transform the country's deregulated arena into a more serious one that doesn't exploit the vulnerable.",
      "\"The whole operation could turn from water into wine,\u201d he said.",
      "Meantime, the demand for Gamblers Anonymous meetings in Sao Paulo has grown so much in recent years that the weekly gathering, in place since the 1990s, was no longer enough. Many groups have added a second day in the week to help new people recover, mostly sports bettors.",
      "Earlier in October, a group on Sao Paulo's northern edge admitted a man who was struggling with sports betting and card games. The 13 other people in the room stressed that he wasn't alone.",
      "\u201cWelcome,\u201d one long-time attendee said, in a greeting that has become a regular for the group. \u201cToday, you are the most important person here.\u201d",
      "___",
      "Dumphreys reported from Rio de Janeiro.",
      "___",
      "This story was first published on Nov 7, 2024. It was corrected on Nov. 8, 2024 to reflect that the betting platforms from Malta, Cura\u00e7ao, Gibraltar the United Kingdom are legal, not illegal."

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.",
      "The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.",
      "Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.",
      "A look at what Trump has proposed:",
      "\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d from his 2016 campaign has become creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He\u2019s pitched \u201cideological screening\u201d for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he\u2019d reinstitute first-term policies such as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.",
      "Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk \u2014 a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden\u2019s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That\u2019s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.",
      "Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It\u2019s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income \u2014 a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy \u201cessential\u201d medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of \u201cany vital infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.",
      "Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.",
      "On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end \u201cboys in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.",
      "The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households\u2019 utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration \u2014 even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations \u2014 though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end \u201cfrivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.\u201d",
      "The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.",
      "He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government\u2019s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.",
      "Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers\u2019 budget actions \u201cset a ceiling\u201d on spending but not a floor \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.",
      "As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.",
      "The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the \u201cMarxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.",
      "As in other policy areas, Trump isn\u2019t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed\u2014none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of \u201cmaking America healthy again.\"",
      "Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy \u2013 and transportation infrastructure spending \u2013 anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America\u2019s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden\u2019s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump \u201cthe union bosses and CEOs\u201d together as complicit in \u201cthis disastrous electric car scheme.\u201d In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield \u2014 an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them leaders,\u201d Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans \u201csee on television.\u201d He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",

      "An expensive campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state Supreme Court seats has yielded mixed results",
      "A costly campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state Supreme Court seats yielded mixed results in Tuesday's election, with Republicans expanding their majority on Ohio's court while candidates backed by progressive groups won in Montana and Michigan.",
      "One of the most expensive and closely watched Supreme Court races in North Carolina, where a Democratic justice campaigned heavily on abortion rights and Republicans hope to expand their majority, remained too early to call Thursday.",
      "Groups on both the right and left spent millions in the leadup to the election hoping to reshape courts that'll be battlegrounds for voting rights, redistricting, abortion and other issues.",
      "Abortion-rights supporters touted victories in states that Donald Trump won, saying it's a sign that reproductive rights will be key in judicial campaigns after the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. In states like Montana and Arizona, state courts may soon be tasked with interpreting how abortion-rights amendments voters passed this week would impact existing laws.",
      "\u201cState Supreme Court judges don't really have anything to say about the economy, but they certainly do have something to say about reproductive rights and voting rights and democracy and what your life is going to be like from a right to liberty perspective in your state,\" said Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cSo I think we have a real opportunity to define these judges and this level of the ballot by reproductive rights.\u201d",
      "The ACLU spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in those states, as well as in Arizona and Texas.",
      "Conservative groups also spent heavily in those states, but with ads focusing on issues other than abortion such as immigration and crime.",
      "In Ohio, all three Democrats running for the state Supreme Court lost their race. The victory gives Republicans a 6-1 majority on the court. A county judge in October struck down the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban and the state Supreme Court is expected to hear more cases aiming to undo regulations that, for example, require 24-hour waiting periods or in-person appointments for patients.",
      "\u201cOhioans made a strong statement tonight that will keep the court under Republican control for years to come,\u201d said Dee Duncan, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee's Judicial Fairness Initiative, which spent nearly $1 million on the race.",
      "Michigan Democrats won two seats on the state\u2019s Supreme Court, expanding their majority to 5-2. While the elections are nonpartisan, parties nominate the candidates.",
      "\u201cWith the liberal majority protected, Michigan Dems\u2019 hard work past and future will not be threatened by the MAGA fanatics that threaten our values here in Michigan,\u201d Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Lavora Barnes said in a statement.",
      "In North Carolina, Justice Allison Riggs trailed narrowly Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin in their race for an eight-year term on the state\u2019s highest court. The Associated Press has not called the race, for which nearly 5.5 million ballots have been counted. Tens of thousands of additional provisional and absentee ballots still had to be reviewed by county election officials, and the trailing candidate could seek a recount if the final margin is narrow enough.",
      "Riggs' campaign focused on reproductive rights, running ads that said Griffin could be a deciding vote on the 5-2 majority Republican court for further abortion restrictions. Griffin had said it was inappropriate for Riggs to talk about an issue that could come before the court.",
      "Heated bids for a pair of seats on Montana's court were a split decision, with county attorney Cory Swanson defeating former U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerry Lynch for chief justice. State judge Katherine Bidegaray defeated state judge Dan Wilson for another open seat on the court.",
      "Progressive groups backed Lynch and Bidegaray, casting the races as key to protecting abortion rights in a state where Republicans control the Legislature and the governor's office. Republicans who complained about the court's rulings against laws that would have restricted abortion access or made it more difficult to vote supported Swanson and Wilson.",
      "A longshot effort by abortion-rights advocates to unseat three justices on Texas' all-Republican Supreme Court fell short, with Jimmy Blacklock, John Devine and Jane Bland winning reelection. The three were part of unanimous rulings rejecting challenges to the state\u2019s abortion ban.",
      "In Arizona, two justices won retention elections despite efforts to oust them over the court decision that cleared way for a long-dormant 1864 law banning nearly all abortions to be enforced. The state Legislature swiftly repealed it, and voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion access up to fetal viability, typically after 21 weeks.",
      "Conservatives also won in Oklahoma, where voters removed one of three Supreme Court justices appointed by a former Democratic governor who were up for retention. A 5-4 ruling by the court last year overturned a portion of the state\u2019s near total ban on abortion. It was the first time any Oklahoma appellate judge had been removed through a retention election.",
      "An Arkansas justice who wrote a blistering dissent when the court's Republican-backed majority blocked an abortion rights measure from the ballot was elected chief justice. That race, however, won't change the court's majority.",
      "The next big battleground comes next year in Wisconsin, where a race will determine whether liberals maintain their 4-3 majority on the court. The open race for retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley's seat comes after the court flipped from conservative control in a 2023 election marked by record-breaking spending.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like state Supreme Court elections are going to go back to the way they were 10 years ago anytime soon,\u201d said Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the judiciary program at the Brennan Center, which has tracked spending on state court races.",

      "The losses are the first on statewide reproductive rights ballot measures anywhere in the U.S. since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a ruling that struck down the nearly 50-year nationwide right to abortion, proving that abortion opponents can win on ballot measures.",
      "There were firsts on the other sides, too: Three amendments call for rolling back abortion bans, including one in Missouri that bars it at all stages of pregnancy with exceptions only under limited circumstances to save the life of the woman.",
      "Here's a look at takeaways from the results.",
      "Missouri is the most populous state where a ballot measure could roll back a current ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy.",
      "But the work isn\u2019t done there.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri filed in a state court Wednesday seeking to invalidate the state's abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care.",
      "The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead, the measure left it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Planned Parenthood leaders said Wednesday on a Zoom call with reporters that they want to start offering abortions at clinics in Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis if they get the judicial ruling they're requesting \u2014 starting with blocking enforcement of laws on the book.",
      "\"This is only the first step to realizing and fully implementing the protections of Amendment 3. It\u2019s certainly not the last step,\u201d said Richard Muniz, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers.",
      "Clinics had stopped providing abortions in Missouri even before the state\u2019s ban took effect in 2022. They said a list of regulations made it impossible for them to operate. In its legal filing, the Planned Parenthood affiliate that covers much of the state says the onerous requirements include clinicians who provide abortion have surgical licenses and that they conduct pelvic exams on all patients \u2014 even if they offer only medication abortions.",
      "\u201cSome of these patients choose medication abortion precisely because they do not want instruments inserted into their vagina,\u201d Dr. Selina Sandoval, an associate medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a legal filing. \u201cI cannot and will not subject my patients to unnecessary exams.\u201d",
      "Planned Parenthood also objects to laws requiring clinicians to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, mandating a 72-hour waiting period for abortions and banning telemedicine for abortion. Besides the ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, the group is calling for having other bans that kick in after eight, 14, 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to be struck down.",
      "Abortion rights advocates heralded victories at the ballot box as a signal of widespread support for abortion rights, even in conservative states.",
      "The three states where abortion measures were defeated had special circumstances that weren't present in the others.",
      "In Florida, the threshold for passing a constitutional amendment is 60% while most states require a simple majority. Most voters supported adding abortion rights \u2014 but it fell short of the requirement.",
      "There, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, also presented a challenge to proponents by steering state GOP funds to counter the measure and defending a state agency for publishing a webpage attacking it, among other government efforts.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure is different from the others because it would have allowed the state to regulate abortion in the second trimester \u2014 but only in ways that protect the health of the woman. Because of that provision, most national abortion rights groups did not put money into promoting it, which could have been a factor in its failure in a conservative state.",
      "In Nebraska, both sides had questions on the ballot. Voters passed the one that bars abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 which is in line with current state law \u2014 and also allows the possibility of more stringent bans. They also rejected the measure that aimed to enshrine into the state constitution the right to abortion until viability, which is considered to be sometime after 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there's not a fixed time.",
      "Abortion rights advocates condemned the novel strategy by anti-abortion groups of putting a competing measure on the ballot as an attempt to confuse voters. The approach was considered by anti-abortion groups elsewhere.",
      "Republican Donald Trump reclaimed the presidency, despite his consistently shifting stances on reproductive rights.",
      "If Republicans win the House, in addition to their victories in the Senate and White House, it could open the door to the passage of a national ban.",
      "Trump has said he would veto a national ban, despite previously declining to answer questions about it.",
      "But Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as \u201cminimum national standards\u201d in order to distort their own stances on the issue, given the political unpopularity of the GOP\u2019s position on abortion.",
      "Judicial appointments have already shaped the national abortion landscape. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned Roe v. Wade. It's not just the Supreme Court. Trump-nominated U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has issued rulings with nationwide consequences, including one impacting access to the abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "Through executive power, a president could also restrict abortion pills sent through the mail and declare that a law that requires doctors to stabilize emergency room patients does not require them to provide abortion. A new administration could also pull back on a federal lawsuit that challenges aspects of Idaho's ban.",
      "One interpretation of the presence of some of the ballot measures was that they were put up in part to drive turnout of Democratic voters in candidate elections.",
      "If that was the plan \u2014 and some abortion rights advocates say it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t seem to sway other statewide races.",
      "The mostly Republican states of Montana and Missouri passed abortion rights protections and also elected GOP candidates for president, U.S. Senate and governor.",
      "In Montana, Republican Tim Sheehy defeated three-term incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, who attempted to pair his campaign with the abortion rights push.",
      "Three other Republican states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 rejected abortion ballot measures and supported Trump for president and GOP senators where they were on the ballot.",
      "The Democratic states of Colorado and Maryland expanded abortion rights and voted for Democrats in statewide elections. The same is true in New York, where the ballot measure bars discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d and does not mention abortion specifically \u2014 but was championed by abortion rights advocates, who say it will preserve access.",
      "The measures also passed in Arizona and Nevada, where the presidential and U.S. Senate races had not been called by midday Wednesday.",
      "Democrats in the most competitive Senate races centered their closing argument and ads around abortion, an issue they hoped to capitalize on after it has previously motivated voters up and down the ballot. But abortion rights failed to put them over the top \u2014 including in Montana.",
      "Texas Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat, failed in his bid to defeat Sen. Ted Cruz after investing $5 million in an ad campaign focused on abortion and invoking the issue in campaign trail speeches and during an October debate. Allred leaned on the personal stories of Texas women impacted by the state's abortion ban that have sparked national outrage.",
      "In Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno defeated incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown after Brown and his allies pounced on cellphone video that emerged late in the campaign showing Moreno criticizing suburban women who base their votes on abortion rights.",
      "A hotly contested race between Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Republican Eric Hovde has also focused heavily on abortion and appeared to be close enough early Wednesday for a recount to be requested.",
      "In the Texas city of Amarillo, located in the state\u2019s conservative Panhandle region, voters overwhelming rejected an anti-abortion proposal that would have essentially banned travel for those seeking abortions out of state by allowing civil lawsuits against anyone who helps a local resident obtain an abortion.",
      "The \u201cSanctuary Cities for the Unborn\u201d ordinance was rejected by nearly 60% of voters.",
      "\u201cWe hope to set the tone for not only the state, but the nation, that we will not penalize anyone for seeking health care when they\u2019re facing an extreme travel ban in their own state,\" said Lindsay London, a nurse who helped found a group to oppose the effort.",

      "North Korea says it has ratified a major defense treaty with Russia stipulating mutual military aid",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea ratified a major defense treaty with Russia stipulating mutual military aid, the North\u2019s state media reported Tuesday, as the U.S., South Korea and Ukraine say North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine.",
      "Russia had completed the ratification of the treaty last week after it was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. It is considered both countries\u2019 biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War.",
      "The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership treaty will take effect when both sides exchange documents on the ratification, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said.",
      "North Korea ratified the treaty through a decree signed Monday by the country's president of state affairs, KCNA said, using one of Kim's titles.",
      "North Korea\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly, has the right to ratify treaties but Kim can unilaterally ratify major ones, according to South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry.",
      "The treaty requires both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. It also calls for the two countries to actively cooperate in efforts to establish a \u201cjust and multipolar new world order\u201d and strengthen cooperation on various sectors including peaceful atomic energy, space, food supply, trade and economy.",
      "Some observers speculate the treaty\u2019s ratification in both countries could signal North Korea could formally enter the Russia-Ukraine war soon.",
      "According to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments, up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia likely as part of the June treaty. Last week, Ukrainian officials said Ukraine and North Korean troops engaged in small-scale fighting while Ukraine\u2019s army fired artillery at North Korean soldiers in Russia\u2019s Kursk border region.",
      "North Korea\u2019s troop dispatch threatens to escalate the almost three-year war. South Korea, the U.S. and their partners also worry about what Russia could give North Korea in return. Possible Russian transfer of sensitive technology to enhance North Korea\u2019s already-advancing nuclear and missile programs would be an alarming development for the U.S. and its allies.",
      "North Korea and Russia have been significantly strengthening their military and other cooperation. South Korea\u2019s spy agency said last month that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles.",

      "An opponent of vaccines who wrote social media posts urging violence against scientists, politicians and public health officials during the COVID-19 pandemic has been sentenced to five years in prison",
      "LONDON -- An opponent of vaccines who wrote social media posts urging violence against scientists, politicians and public health officials during the COVID-19 pandemic was sentenced Monday to five years in prison after being convicted of encouraging terrorism.",
      "A British judge said 55-year-old Patrick Ruane had a \u201ccompulsive and obsessive\u201d opposition to vaccines and spewed vitriol on the Telegram messaging app. One message described \u201cwhacking\u201d England\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, over the head.",
      "In a series of messages in 2021, Ruane posted that he was \u201call for hunting them down and \u2026 executing\u201d those who made and delivered COVID-19 vaccines. He encouraged others to \u201cfind where they live, put a kill squad together and shoot\u201d them in their beds.",
      "In a discussion about Whitty, the vaccine opponent wrote that hitting someone on the back of the skull with a rounders bat \u2013 similar to a baseball bat \u2013 or a metal mace \u201cwould turn said target into a vegetable for the rest of its life.\u201d",
      "He also called for an \u201cIRA playbook,\u201d a reference to the Irish Republican Army\u2019s bombing and shooting campaign, and advocated blowing up vaccine laboratories and 5G phone towers.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t idle chit-chat online \u2013 he was encouraging people to seriously injure or kill others, suggesting who to target,\" said Acting Commander Gareth Rees of the Metropolitan Police Counterterrorism Command, which began investigating Ruane's posts in 2021.",
      "Prosecutor Julia Faure Walker said the posts reached a \u201cvery large audience\u201d through two Telegram chat groups, one of which had 18,000 users and the other 8,000 users.",
      "Ruane, an audio producer for films, was initially arrested in November 2021 and charged almost two years later. He was convicted at London\u2019s Central Criminal Court in September on two counts of encouraging terrorism.",
      "Passing sentence on Monday, Judge Richard Marks said Ruane\u2019s messages were \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d during a volatile time.",
      "\u201cYou were, of course, fully entitled to publicly vent your views and to do so in an extremely cogent and forceful way, if you chose,\u201d the judge said. \u201cYou, however, went very much further and in so doing committed the offences of which you were convicted.\u201d",

      "Four-year-old Hussein Mikdad survived an Israeli airstrike on his home in a Beirut suburb last month",
      "BEIRUT -- Curled up in his father \u2019s lap, clinging to his chest, Hussein Mikdad cried his heart out. The 4-year-old kicked his doctor with his intact foot and pushed him away with the arm that was not in a cast. \u201cMy Dad! My Dad!\" Hussein said. \"Make him leave me alone!\u201d With eyes tearing up in relief and pain, the father reassured his son and pulled him closer.",
      "Hussein and his father, Hassan, are the only survivors of their family after an Israeli airstrike last month on their Beirut neighborhood. The strike killed 18 people, including his mother, three siblings and six relatives.",
      "\u201cCan he now shower?\u201d the father asked the doctor.",
      "Ten days after surgery, doctors examining Hussein's wounds said the boy is healing properly. He has rods in his fractured right thigh and stitches that assembled his torn tendons back in place on the right arm. The pain has subsided, and Hussein should be able to walk again in two months \u2014 albeit with a lingering limp.",
      "A prognosis for Hussein's invisible wounds is much harder to give. He is back in diapers and has begun wetting his bed. He hardly speaks and has not said a word about his mother, two sisters and brother.",
      "\u201cThe trauma is not just on the muscular skeletal aspect. But he is also mentally hurt,\u201d Imad Nahle, one of Hussein\u2019s orthopedic surgeons, said.",
      "Israel said, without elaborating, that the strike on the Mikdad neighborhood struck a Hezbollah target. In the war that has escalated since September, Israeli airstrikes have increasingly hit residential areas around Lebanon. Israel accuses the Lebanese militant group of hiding its capabilities and fighters among civilians. It vows to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "But children have been caught in the midst.",
      "With more strikes on homes and in residential areas, doctors are seeing more children affected by the violence. More than 100 children have been killed in Lebanon in the past six weeks and hundreds injured. And of the 14,000 wounded since last year, around 10% are children. Many have been left with severed limbs, burned bodies, and broken families \u2014 scars that could last for a lifetime.",
      "Ghassan Abu Sittah, a renowned British-Palestinian surgeon who is also treating Hussein, sees that long road ahead. This is his worry: \u201cIt leaves us with a generation of physically wounded children, children who are psychologically and emotionally wounded.\"",
      "At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which is receiving limited cases of war casualties, Nahle said he operated on five children in the past five weeks \u2014 up from no cases before. Most were referred from south and eastern Lebanon.",
      "A few miles away, at the Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui, one of the country\u2019s largest burns centers increased its capacity by nearly 180% since September so it could accommodate more war wounded, its medical director Naji Abirached said. About a fifth of the newly admitted patients are children.",
      "In one of the burn center\u2019s ICU units lies Ivana Skakye. She turned 2 in the hospital ward last week. Ivana has been healing from burns she sustained following an Israeli airstrike outside their home in southern Lebanon on Sept. 23. Israel said it struck ammunition depots and launchers in southern Lebanon that day when its warplanes launched hundreds of airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, making it the deadliest day of the war so far. More than 500 people were killed.",
      "Six weeks later, the tiny Ivana remains wrapped in white gauze from head to toe except her torso. She sustained third-degree burns over 40 percent of her body. Her hair and head, her left side all the way to her legs, both her arms and her chest were burned. Her family home was damaged, its ceiling set afire. The family\u2019s valuables, packed in their car as they prepared to leave, were also torched. Ivana\u2019s older sister, Rahaf, 7, has recovered faster from burns to her face and hands.",
      "Fatima Zayoun, their mother, was in the kitchen when the explosion hit. Zayoun jumped up to grab the girls, who were playing on the terrace.",
      "It was, Zayoun said, \"as if something lifted me up so that I can grab my kids. I have no idea how I managed to pull them in and throw them out of the window. She spoke from the ICU burns unit. \u201cThey were not on fire, but they were burned. Black ash covered them. ... (Ivana) was without any hair. I told myself, `That is not her.'\u201d",
      "Now, Ivana's wound dressings are changed every two days. Her doctor, Ziad Sleiman, said she could be discharged in a few days. She\u2019s back again to saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cBye \u2014 shorthand for wanting to go out.",
      "Like Hussein, though, Ivana has no home to return to. Her parents fear collective shelters could cause an infection to return.",
      "After seeing her kids \u201csizzling on the floor,\u201d Zayoun, 35, said that even if their home is repaired, she wouldn\u2019t want to return. \u201cI saw death with my own eyes,\u201d she said.",
      "Zayoun was 17 last time Israel and Hezbollah were at war, in 2006. Displaced with her family then, she said she almost enjoyed the experience, riding out of their village in a truck full of their belongings, mixing with new people, learning new things. They returned home when the war was over.",
      "\u201cBut this war is hard. They are hitting everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do they want from us? Do they want to hurt our children? We are not what they are looking for.\"",
      "Abu Sittah, the reconstructive surgeon, said most of the children's injuries are from blasts or collapsing rubble. That attack on a space they expect to be inviolable can have lingering effects.",
      "\u201cChildren feel safe at home,\" he said. \"The injury makes them for the first time lose that sense of security \u2014 that their parents are keeping them safe, that their homes are invincible, and suddenly their homes become not so.\u201d",
      "One recent morning, children were playing in the courtyard of a vocational school-turned-shelter in Dekwaneh, north of Beirut, where nearly 3,000 people displaced from the south are now living. The parents were busy with an overflowing bathroom that serves one floor in a building that houses nearly 700 people.",
      "Only playtime brings the children, from different villages in the south, together. They were divided in two teams, ages ranging between 6 and 12, competing to get the handkerchief first. A tiny girl hugged and held hands with strangers visiting the shelter. \u201cI am from Lebanon. Don't tell anyone,\u201d she whispered in their ears.",
      "The game turned rowdy when two girls in their early teens got into a fist fight. Pushing and shoving began. Tears and tantrums followed. The tiny girl walked away in a daze.",
      "Maria Elizabeth Haddad, manager of the psychosocial support programs in Beirut and neighboring areas for the U.S.-based International Medical Corps, said parents in shelters reported signs of increased anxiety, hostility and aggression among kids. They talk back to parents and ignore rules. Some have developed speech impediments and clinginess. One is showing early signs of psychosis.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be residual symptoms when they grow up, especially related to attachment ties, to feeling of security,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cIt is a generational trauma. We have experienced it before with our parents. ... They don\u2019t have stability or search for (extra) stability. This is not going to be easy to overcome.\u201d",
      "Children represent more than a third of over 1 million people displaced by the war in Lebanon and following Israeli evacuation notices, according to U.N. and government estimates (more than 60,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel). That leaves hundreds of thousands in Lebanon without schooling, either because their schools were inaccessible or have been turned into shelters.",
      "Hussein's father says he and his son must start together from scratch. With help from relatives, the two have found a temporary shelter in a home \u2014 and, for the father, a brief sense of relief. \u201cI thank God he is not asking for or about his mother and his siblings,\u201d said Hassan Mikdad, the 40-year-old father.",
      "He has no explanation for his son, who watched their family die in their home. His two sisters \u2014 Celine, 10, and Cila, 14 \u2014 were pulled out of the rubble the following day. His mother, Mona, was pulled out three days later. She was locked in an embrace with her 6-year-old son, Ali.",
      "The strike on Oct. 21 also caused damage across the street, to one of Beirut\u2019s main public hospitals, breaking solar panels and windows in the pharmacy and the dialysis unit. The father survived because he had stepped out for coffee. He watched his building crumble in the late-night airstrike. He also lost his shop, his motorcycles and car \u2014 all the evidence of his 16 years of family life.",
      "His friend, Hussein Hammoud, arrived on the scene to help sift through rubble. Hammoud spotted young Hussein Mikdad\u2019s fingers in the darkness in an alley behind their home. At first, he thought they were severed limbs \u2014 until he heard the boy\u2019s screams. He dug out Hussein with glass lodged in his leg and a metal bar in his shoulder. Hammoud said he didn\u2019t recognize the boy. He held the child's almost-severed wrist in place.",
      "In the hospital now, Hussein Mikdad sipped a juice as he listened to his father and his friend. His father turned to him, asking if he wanted a Spider-Man toy \u2014 an effort to forestall a new outburst of tears. He said he buys Hussein a toy each day.",
      "\u201cWhat I am living through seems like a big lie. ...The mind can\u2019t comprehend,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank God for the blessing that is Hussein.\u201d"

      "A new typhoon has made landfall in the northeastern Philippines, which has been battered by earlier storms",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- A new typhoon barreled across an agricultural region in the northeastern Philippines on Monday after thousands were evacuated to safety while still struggling to recover from the devastation caused by three successive storms in the last three weeks.",
      "Typhoon Toraji slammed into northeastern Aurora province and was forecast to blow over the mountainous Luzon region, where President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. \u2014 just the day before \u2014 inspected the damage from the last storm and led the distribution of food packs to residents in Cagayan and Ilocos provinces. Marcos skipped this week\u2019s Asia-Pacific Cooperation forum in Peru to oversee recovery efforts from back-to-back storms.",
      "After making landfall in Aurora on Monday morning with sustained winds of up to 130 kilometers (81 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 180 kph (112 mph), the typhoon was expected to barrel northwestward across Luzon, weaken as it crosses a mountain range and then blow into the South China Sea.",
      "Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla on Sunday ordered the forcible evacuation of people in 2,500 villages expected to be lashed by Toraji, locally named Nika, warning that the rain-soaked Luzon mountains, valleys and plains were more susceptible to flash floods and landslides. With the typhoon approaching fast, there was little time to move large numbers of people to safety, he said.",
      "\"We understand if some would want to stay, but we have to get them out,\u201d Remulla told reporters.",
      "The military said its disaster-response forces have been deployed near high-risk areas and were standing by for new contingencies. It added that it suspended combat drills in the north due to the weather.",
      "\u201cOur commitment remains steadfast in safeguarding and assisting our countrymen specially in times of disaster,\u201d Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesperson Col. Francel Margareth Padilla said.",
      "Schools were shut down, inter-island ferry services and domestic flights were suspended in provinces in or near the path of the typhoon, the 14th weather disturbance to batter the Philippine archipelago this year. Forecasters said they were monitoring another brewing storm in the Pacific that could affect the country if it strengthens.",
      "The last two typhoons and a tropical storm caused more than 160 deaths, damaged thousands of houses and farmlands and affected more than 9 million people, including hundreds of thousands who fled to emergency shelters, after dumping from one to two months\u2019 worth of rain in just 24 hours in some cities and towns.",
      "Overwhelmed, the Philippines received help from Southeast Asian countries led by Singapore, along with longtime treaty ally the United States, to transport food, water and other aid to hard-hit northern provinces.",
      "The Philippine archipelago is often battered by typhoons and earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the most natural disaster-prone countries in the world.",
      "In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines."

      "Police said the fire was quickly extinguished and riot officers cleared the square. Images online showed people damaging property and setting firecrackers.",
      "Police said it was not clear who started the unrest and whether it was related to what happened last week. But they noted the tense atmosphere since five people were treated in the hospital and dozens detained Thursday following a Maccabi Tel Aviv-Ajax match. Youths on scooters and on foot went in search of Israeli fans, punching and kicking them and then fleeing to evade police, according to Amsterdam\u2019s mayor.",

    "story": [
      "New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has made a \u201cformal and unreserved\u201d apology in Parliament for the abuse, torture and neglect of an estimated 200,000 children and vulnerable adults in care",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon made a \u201cformal and unreserved\u201d apology in Parliament on Tuesday for the widespread abuse, torture and neglect of hundreds of thousands of children and vulnerable adults in care.",
      "\u201cIt was horrific. It was heartbreaking. It was wrong. And it should never have happened,\u201d Luxon said, as he spoke to lawmakers and a public gallery packed with survivors of the abuse.",
      "An estimated 200,000 people in state, foster and faith-based care suffered \u201cunimaginable\u201d abuse over a period of seven decades, a blistering report released in July said at the end of the largest inquiry ever undertaken in New Zealand. They were disproportionately M\u0101ori, New Zealand\u2019s Indigenous people.",
      "\u201cFor many of you it changed the course of your life, and for that, the government must take responsibility,\u201d Luxon said. He said he was apologizing for previous governments too.",
      "In foster and church care \u2014 as well as in state-run institutions, including hospitals and residential schools \u2014 vulnerable people \u201cshould have been safe and treated with respect, dignity and compassion,\" he added. \u201cBut instead, you were subjected to horrific abuse and neglect and in some cases torture.\u201d",
      "The findings of the six-year investigation believed to be the widest-ranging of comparable probes worldwide were a \u201cnational disgrace,\u201d the inquiry's report said. New Zealand's investigation followed two decades of such inquiries around the globe as nations struggle to reckon with authorities\u2019 transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in care.",
      "Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in New Zealand's state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 \u2014 in a country that today has a population of 5 million \u2014 nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected.",
      "\u201cWe will never know that true number,\u201d Chris Hipkins, the leader of the opposition, told Parliament. \u201cMany people entering into state and faith-based institutions were undocumented. Records were incomplete, they've gone missing, and in some cases, yes, they were deliberately destroyed.\u201d",
      "In response to the findings, New Zealand\u2019s government agreed for the first time that historical treatment of some children in a notorious state-run hospital amounted to torture \u2014 a claim successive administrations had rejected.",
      "\u201cI am deeply sorry that New Zealand did not do better by you. I am sorry you were not believed when you came forward to report your abuse,\u201d Luxon said. \u201cI am sorry that many abusers were not made to face justice which meant that other people experienced abuse that could have been prevented.\u201d",
      "His government was working on 28 of the inquiry's 138 recommendations, Luxon said, although he did not yet have concrete details on financial redress, which the inquiry had exhorted since 2021 and said could run to billions of dollars.",
      "Luxon was decried by some survivors and advocates earlier Tuesday for not divulging compensation plans alongside the apology. He told Parliament a single redress system would be established in 2025.",
      "He did not, however, suggest a figure for the amount the government expected to pay.",
      "\u201cThere will be a big bill, but it's nothing compared to the debt we owe those survivors and it must not be the reason for any further delay,\u201d said Hipkins, the opposition leader.",
      "Survivors began to arrive at Parliament hours before the apology, having won spots in the public gallery \u2014 which only seats about 200 people \u2014 by ballot. Some were reluctant to accept the state's words, because they said the scale of the horror was not yet fully understood by lawmakers and public servants.",
      "Jeering was so loud during an apology from the country's solicitor-general that her speech was inaudible. Others called out or left the room in tears while senior public servants from relevant health and welfare agencies spoke before Luxon's remarks.",
      "Survivors invited to give speeches were required to do so before Luxon's apology \u2014 rather than in response to it, said Tu Chapman, one of those asked to speak.",
      "\u201cRight now I feel alone and in utter despair at the way in which this government has undertaken the task of acknowledging all survivors,\u201d she told a crowd at Parliament.",
      "The abuse \"ripped families and communities apart, trapping many into a life of prison, incarceration, leaving many uneducated,\u201d said Keith Wiffin \u2014 a survivor of abuse in a notorious state-run boys' home. \u201cIt has tarred our international reputation as an upholder of human rights, something this nation likes to dine out on.\u201d",
      "The inquiry's recommendations included seeking apologies from state and church leaders, among them Pope Francis. It also endorsed creating offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming streets and monuments dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.",
      "Its writers were scathing about how widely the abuse \u2014 and the identities of many abusers \u2014 were known about for years, with nothing done to stop it.",
      "\u201cThis has meant you have had to re-live your trauma over and over again,\u201d said Luxon. \u201cAgencies should have done better and must commit to doing so in the future.\u201d",
      "He did not concede that public servants or ministers in his government who had denied state abuse was widespread when they served in previous administrations should lose their jobs. Luxon has also rejected suggestions by survivors that policies he has enacted which disproportionately target M\u0101ori \u2014 such as crackdowns on gangs and the establishment of military-style boot camps for young offenders \u2014 undermine his government's regret about the abuse.",
      "M\u0101ori are over-represented in prisons and gangs. In 2023, 68% of children in state care were M\u0101ori, although they are less than 20% of New Zealand's population.",
      "\u201cIt's not enough to say sorry,\u201d said Fa\u2019afete Taito, a survivor of violent abuse at another state-run home, and a former gang member. \u201cIt's what you do to heal the wounds of your actions and make sure it never happens again that really counts.\u201d"

      "JERUSALEM -- Israel has failed to meet United States demands to allow greater humanitarian access to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, where conditions are worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war, international aid organizations said Tuesday.",
      "The Biden administration last month called on Israel to \u201csurge\u201d more food and other emergency aid into Gaza, giving it a 30-day deadline that was expiring Tuesday. It warned that failure to comply could trigger U.S. laws requiring it to scale back military support as Israel wages war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.",
      "Israel has announced a series of steps toward improving the situation. But U.S. officials recently signaled Israel still isn\u2019t doing enough, though they have not said if they will take any action against it.",
      "Israel\u2019s new foreign minister, Gideon Saar, appeared to downplay the deadline, telling reporters on Monday he was confident \u201cthe issue would be solved.\u201d The Biden administration may have less leverage after the reelection of Donald Trump, who was a staunch supporter of Israel in his first term.",
      "Tuesday's report, authored by eight international aid organizations, listed 19 measures of compliance with the U.S. demands. It said Israel had failed to comply with 15 and only partially complied with four.",
      "An Oct. 13 letter signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called on Israel to, among other things: allow a minimum of 350 truckloads of goods to enter Gaza each day; open a fifth crossing into the besieged territory; allow people in Israeli-imposed coastal tent camps to move inland ahead of the winter; and ensure access for aid groups to hard-hit northern Gaza. It also called on Israel to halt legislation that would hinder the operations of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA.",
      "Despite Israeli steps to increase the flow of aid, levels remain far below the U.S. benchmarks. The promised fifth crossing was set to open Tuesday, but residents remain crammed in the tent camps and access for aid workers to northern Gaza remains restricted. Israel also has pressed ahead with its laws against UNRWA.",
      "\"Israel not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in Northern Gaza,\" the report said. \u201cThat situation is in an even more dire state today than a month ago.\u201d",
      "The report was co-signed by Anera, Care, MedGlobal, Mercy Corps, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam, Refugees International and Save the Children.",
      "U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller last week said Israel had made some progress, but needs to do more to meet the U.S. conditions. \u201cWhat's important when you see all of these steps taken is what that means for the results,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel launched a major offensive last month in northern Gaza, where it says Hamas militants had regrouped. The operation has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands. Israel has allowed almost no aid to enter the area, where tens of thousands of civilians have stayed despite evacuation orders.",
      "Aid to Gaza plummeted in October, when just 34,000 tons of food entered, or less than half the previous month, according to Israeli data.",
      "U.N. agencies say even less actually gets through due to Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting, and lawlessness that makes it difficult to collect and distribute aid on the Gaza side.",
      "In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, according to Israeli figures, and 81 a day in the first week of November. The U.N. puts the number lower, at 37 trucks daily since the beginning of October.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, said the drop in the number of aid trucks in October was due to closures of the crossings for the Jewish high holidays and memorials marking the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that triggered the war.",
      "\u201cOctober was a very weak month,\u201d said an Israeli official, who spoke under condition of anonymity in line with military briefing rules. \u201cBut if you look at the November numbers, we are holding steady at around 50 trucks per day to northern Gaza and 150 per day to the rest of Gaza.\u201d",
      "Aid distribution is also being hampered by the U.N. and other agencies' failure to collect aid that entered Gaza, leading to bottlenecks, and looting from Hamas and organized crime families in Gaza, he said. He estimated as much as 40% of aid is stolen on some days.",
      "Israel on Monday announced a small expansion of its coastal \u201chumanitarian zone,\u201d where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have sought shelter in sprawling tent camps. It also has announced additional steps, including connecting electricity for a desalination plant in the central Gaza town of Deir al Balah, and efforts to bring in supplies for the winter. On Tuesday, COGAT announced a \u201ctactical\u201d delivery of food and water to Beit Hanoun, one of the hardest-hit towns in northern Gaza.",
      "The war began last year when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel's bombardment and ground invasion have killed over 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many of those killed were militants. Around 90% of the population has been displaced, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps, with little food, water or hygiene facilities.",
      "The United States has rushed billions of dollars in military aid to Israel during the war and has shielded it from international calls for a cease-fire while pressing it to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. The amount of aid entering Gaza increased under U.S. pressure last spring after Israeli strikes killed seven aid workers before dwindling again.",
      "Trump has promised to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how. He was a staunch defender of Israel during his previous term, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says they have spoken three times since his reelection last week.",
      "Israeli President Isaac Herzog, whose role is mostly ceremonial, is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday.",
      "Former State Department official Charles Blaha, who ran the office in charge of ensuring that U.S. military support complies with U.S. and international law, predicted the Biden would administration would find that Israel violated U.S. law by blocking humanitarian aid from reaching Palestinians in Gaza.",

      "The 251-page report concluded that Welby failed to report Smyth to authorities when he was informed of the abuse in August 2013, soon after he became Archbishop of Canterbury.",
      "Welby last week took responsibility for not ensuring that the allegations were pursued as \u201cenergetically\u201d as they should have been after he learned of the abuse, but said he had decided not to resign.",
      "On Monday, his office issued a statement reiterating Welby\u2019s \u201chorror at the scale of John Smyth\u2019s egregious abuse.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs he has said, he had no awareness or suspicion of the allegations before he was told in 2013 \u2014 and therefore, having reflected, he does not intend to resign,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe hopes the Makin Review supports the ongoing work of building a safer church here and around the world.\u201d",
      "Church officials were first made aware of the abuse in 1982, when they received the results of an internal investigation into Smyth. The recipients of that report \u201cparticipated in an active cover-up\u201d to prevent its findings from coming to light, the Makin Review found.",
      "Between 1984 and 2001, Smyth moved to Zimbabwe and subsequently relocated to South Africa. He continued to abuse boys and young men in Zimbabwe and there is evidence that the abuse continued in South Africa until he died in August 2018.",
      "Smyth\u2019s abuse wasn\u2019t made public until a 2017 investigation by Britain\u2019s Channel 4 television, which led Hampshire Police to start an investigation. Police were planning to question Smyth at the time of his death and had been preparing to extradite him.",
      "The Makin Review found that if Smyth had been reported to police in 2013, it could have helped to uncover the truth, prevented further abuse and led to a possible criminal conviction.",
      "\u201cIn effect, three and a half years was lost, a time within which John Smyth could have been brought to justice and any abuse he was committing in South Africa discovered and stopped,\u201d the review found.",
      "The Archbishop of Canterbury is the head of the Church of England and is seen as the spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion, which has more than 85 million members in 165 countries. He is considered first among equals with respect to the communion\u2019s other primates.",

      "U.S. researchers have concluded that China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor to power future aircraft carriers",
      "BANGKOK -- China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing the country\u2019s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California is the first to confirm it is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \u201cblue-water\u201d force capable of operating around the globe in a growing challenge to the United States.",
      "Nuclear carriers take longer to build than conventional carriers, but once in operation they are able to stay at sea for much longer because they do not need to refuel, and there is more room on board for fuel and weapons for aircraft, thus extending their capabilities. They are also able to produce more power to run advanced systems.",
      "Right now, only the United States and France have nuclear-powered carriers. The U.S. has 11 in total, which allows it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "China currently has three carriers, including the new Type 003 Fujian, which was the first both designed and built by China. It has said work is already underway on a fourth, but it has not announced whether that will be nuclear or conventionally powered.",
      "The modernization aligns with China\u2019s \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\u201d for its navy \u201cto operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China\u2019s military.",
      "Middlebury researchers were initially investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan over suspicions that China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons. Instead they said they determined that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship.",
      "The conclusion was based upon a wide variety of sources, including satellite images, project tenders, personnel files, and environmental impact studies.",
      "The reactor is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship.\u201d as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizeable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \u201cfirst-class\u201d navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s great rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \u201cspeeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\u201d",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the new Fujian aircraft carrier in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \u201csoon be announced,\u201d but so far it has not been.",
      "Neither China's Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "Even if the carrier that has been started will likely be another conventionally-powered Type 003 ship, experts say Chinese shipyards have the capability to work on more than one carrier at a time, and that they could produce a new nuclear-powered vessel concurrently.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico is facing a second Donald Trump presidency, and few countries can match its experience as a target of Trump's rhetoric: There have been threats to close the border, impose tariffs and even send U.S. forces to fight Mexican drug cartels if the country doesn\u2019t do more to stem the flow of migrants and drugs.",
      "That\u2019s not to mention what mass deportations of migrants who are in the U.S. illegally could do to remittances \u2014 the money sent home by migrants \u2014 that have become one of Mexico\u2019s main sources of income.",
      "But as much as this second round looks like the first round \u2014 when Mexico pacified Trump by quietly ceding to his immigration demands \u2014 circumstances have changed, and not necessarily for the better. Today, Mexico has in Claudia Sheinbaum a somewhat stern leftist ideologue as president, and Trump is not known for handling such relations well.",
      "Back in 2019, Mexico\u2019s then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was a charismatic, plain-spoken, folksy leader who seemed to understand Trump, because both had a transactional view of politics: You give me what I want, I\u2019ll give you what you want. The two went on to form a chummy relationship.",
      "But while L\u00f3pez Obrador was forged in the give-and-take politics of the often-corrupt former ruling party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, Sheinbaum grew up in a family of leftist activists and got her political experience in radical university student movements.",
      "\u201cClaudia is more ideological than L\u00f3pez Obrador, and so the problem is that I see her potentially responding to Trumpian policies, whether it\u2019s, you know, organized crime or immigration or tariffs with a much more nationalistic, jingoistic view of the relationship,\u201d said Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S. from 2007 to 2013.",
      "Sheinbaum made a point of being one of the first world leaders to call Trump on Thursday to congratulate him after the election, but during the call Trump did two things that may say a lot about how things will go.",
      "First, Sheinbaum said, Trump quickly brought up the border to remind her there were issues there. Then he asked Sheinbaum to send his greetings to L\u00f3pez Obrador, with whom Trump said he had \u201ca very good relationship.\u201d That might suggest that Trump believes that L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2014 the new president's political mentor \u2014 is still in charge, a view shared by some analysts.",
      "Sarukhan said he believes the fact that Sheinbaum is a woman and is from Mexico will be \"a very important challenge, an issue out there as both of them get going in their relationship.\u201d",
      "There's little likelihood that Trump will get caught up in other issues and just forget about Mexico. Karoline Leavitt, the Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman, said Trump had been given \"a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver.\u201d",
      "Not everything has changed for the worse: Cross-border trade has topped $800 billion per year and U.S. companies are more dependent than ever on Mexican plants.",
      "But the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, or USMCA, is coming up for review, and Mexico has made legal changes that Trump could seize on to demand a re-negotiation of parts of the deal.",
      "Sheinbaum has suggested Mexico won't give in even if backed into a corner, saying \u201cwe obviously are going to address any problems that come up with dialogue, as a collaborative process, and if not, we are going to stand up, we are prepared to do that with great unity.\u201d",
      "Standing up hasn\u2019t worked particularly well before. In 2018, Marcelo Ebrard was Mexico\u2019s top diplomat; former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Ebrard basically bent to U.S. demands to keep asylum seekers in Mexico and accept migrants back even if they weren\u2019t Mexicans.",
      "Ebrard just asked that the deal not be made public to avoid embarrassing L\u00f3pez Obrador, Pompeo wrote. (Ebrard later claimed he had avoided signing a much worse \"safe third country\u2019\" agreement.)",
      "Today, Ebrard is Mexico\u2019s economy secretary, and would lead Mexico\u2019s delegation in the scheduled 2026 review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, something that Trump has greeted with mirth (\"I've never seen anybody fold like that,\" Trump once said of Ebrard.)",
      "Ebrard on Thursday downplayed any risks this time around, saying e conomic ties between the two countries would keep Trump from closing borders or imposing tariffs.",
      "\u201cI am optimistic. Unlike other countries, we are the largest trading partner (of the U.S.), so, if you put up a tariff, that will have repercussions in the United States,\u201d Ebrard said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it is going to be easy, because it is not at all easy, but the relationship with President Trump will be good because, what unites us? These numbers, this gigantic economy.\u201d",
      "But some former diplomats say any argument that Mexico can avoid friction with the Trump administration is overconfident, and that 2025 is not necessarily going to be like 2019.",
      "Martha B\u00e1rcena, Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. from 2018 to 2021, said she doesn't think Trump would back away from campaign promises to deport migrants who are in the country illegally. She said Mexican officials who believe Trump might temper his \u201ccampaign promises because Mexican migrants are necessary for the U.S. economy\u201d are being overly optimistic.",
      "\u201cMexico is looking at it through the lens of economic logic. The logic that the Trump campaign applies on immigration is a logic of national security and cultural identity issues,\" B\u00e1rcena said.",
      "Some of Trump's biggest policy concerns \u2013 restoring U.S. jobs and the increasing rivalry with China \u2014 also run through Mexico.",
      "U.S. and foreign automakers have set up dozens of plants in Mexico, and some in the U.S. worry that Chinese companies could do the same to take advantage of existing trade rules to export Chinese cars or auto parts to the United States.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help that Sheinbaum has pushed through L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policies aimed at eliminating independent regulatory and oversight bodies, and laws the U.S. government says could reduce the independence of the judiciary, both of which are required under the USMCA trade agreement.",
      "\u201cIf they go ahead with the elimination of independent regulators and autonomous bodies, that\u2019s going to be a further violation of the USMCA,\u201d Sarukhan said. \u201cAnd then that\u2019s going to make things even worse. Obviously, the big piece is going to be China and the Chinese footprint in Mexico.\u201d",
      "That could lead Trump to demand the re-negotiation of all auto industry agreements under the trade pact.",
      "As far as efforts to jointly combat the illegal drug trade \u2014 such cooperation fell to historic lows in 2019 and 2020 \u2014 there have been some modestly encouraging signs. Last week, Mexico announced the seizure in Tijuana of over 300,000 fentanyl pills after months when t he country\u2019s entire seizures had amounted to as little as 50 grams \u2014 a couple of ounces \u2014 per week.",
      "Sheinbaum, who took office on Oct. 1, also appears to be tacitly abandoning L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s strategy of not confronting drug cartels. But neither she nor her predecessor and political mentor could ever accept any Trump plan to send U.S. forces to operate independently on Mexican soil.",
      "It remains to see how far Trump might go; he often makes only token gestures to carry through on threats. But Sarukhan noted, \u201cI do think that he will talk loudly and carry a big stick.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press.",
      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \"blue-water\u201d force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States.",
      "\u201cNuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\u201d said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \u201cFor China\u2019s leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country\u2019s global image as a leading power.\u201d",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",
      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",
      "Neither China\u2019s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\u201cThe reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\u201d",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen\u2019s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles (112 kilometers) southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship\u201d under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \u201cnational defense-related construction project\u201d that is classified \u201csecret.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\u201d researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \u201cconvincing argument.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\u201d she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \u201ccarefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\u201d",
      "\u201cGiven the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\u201d said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \u201cski-jump\u201d type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \u201csoon be announced,\u201d but so far it has not been.",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \u201cincremental improvements.\u201d",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \u201chave taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\u201d",
      "Eventually, however, \u201clarger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\u201d Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\u201cAs well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\u201d Childs said.",
      "\u201cMuch will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\u201d",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \u201cwith greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\u201d said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\u201cThese carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\u201d Zhao said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \u201cfirst-class\u201d navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \u201cspeeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\u201d",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",
      "And China's \u201cgrowing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China\u2019s shore,\u201d the report said.",

      "Human Rights Watch said the U.N. is failing to protect civilians in Sudan's war and called for the urgent deployment of a protection force",
      "CAIRO -- A leading rights group on Monday called for an international force to protect civilians in war-torn Sudan amid reports that a notorious paramilitary group has killed dozens of civilians and committed widespread rapes during a rampage in a province neighboring Khartoum.",
      "Sudan has been plunged into war for narly 19 months in a struggle for power between the military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which has been accused of atrocities in multiple areas where it has seized control.",
      "The Rapid Support Forces rampaged through the province of Gezira last month , attacking towns and villages.",
      "Human Rights Watch said the RSF has \u201ckilled, injured, and unlawfully detained scores of civilians and raped women and girls\u201d in Gezira. It urged Britain to use its turn as president of the United Nations Security Council this month to push for U.N. action to deploy a mission to protect civilians in Sudan.",
      "\u201cThis recent massive uptick in the Rapid Support Forces\u2019 heinous attacks against civilians should end any lingering hopes that these crimes will stop without a strong global response,\u201d said Mohamed Osman, HRW\u2019s Sudan researcher. \u201cThe U.N. Security Council\u2019s minimal action is clearly failing to protect civilians.\"",
      "The war began in April 2023 when growing tensions between the military and RSF exploded into fighting in the capital Khartoum and around Sudan. More than 24,000 people have been killed and more than 14 million people \u2014 about 30% of the population \u2014 have been driven from their homes, creating the world\u2019s largest displacement crisis this year, according to the International Organization for Migration, or IOM. Famine has struck some areas, and a cholera outbreak has killed more than 800 people and sickened 28,000 others.",
      "Gezira province, southeast of Khartoum, has been largely controlled by the RSF since December. In October, one of its commanders running the province, Abu Aqlah Keikel, defected and surrendered to the military.",
      "RSF fighters responded with a rampage through towns and villages across the province.",
      "The fighters shot civilians and sexually attacked and raped women and girls in multiple places, according to the U.N. and local groups. About 135,000 people have been forced to flee their homes since Oct. 20, according to the IOM.",
      "Three Sudanese - two women and a young man - told The Associated Press that RSF fighters stormed their town, Tamboul, on Oct. 22, firing on civilians in their houses. They said they saw fighters shoot 12 men in the streets as they tried to escape. Many people, including women and girls, were detained, they said.",
      "\u201cThey went from house to house telling people to leave\u201d and searching for people connected to Keikel, said one woman, Inaam Abu Gassim, speaking by phone from her shelter in nearby Qadarif province.",
      "At least 47 women and girls were raped around Tamboul, the Sudanese Doctors\u2019 Union said. A 7-year-old girl bled to dead after she was raped, Dr. Yassar al-Besheri, a spokesman for the union, told the AP.",
      "In another town, Sariha, at least 123 people were killed and 200 others wounded in late October, the union said.",
      "Human Rights Watch quoted a man from Sariha as saying that RSF fighters stopped him, his wife and three daughters as they fled their homes on Oct. 22.",
      "\u201cOne of the RSF soldiers looked at my youngest daughter, who is 15, and said: \u2018Leave her so we can enjoy her, and you can leave.\u2019,\u201d the 51-year-old man was quoted as saying. He and his family, including his daughter, managed to escape, HRW reported.",
      "In the city of al-Hilaliya, the union said at least 200 people died this month. At least two dozen were killed by RSF fighters. The rest reportedly died from torture, starvation and disease, it said.",
      "Sudan's conflict has raged as global attention has been shifted over the past year to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, and recently to Lebanon where Israel launched a ground offensive against Hezbollah last month.",
      "Rights groups have repeatedly urged international powers to pressure Sudan\u2019s warring sides to stop fighting and negotiate a peaceful settlement to the conflict. The United States and Saudi Arabia have led multiple rounds of talks between the military and the RSF, most recently in August, but all failed to establish a cease-fire.",
      "A senior U.S. government official said the warring sides have been focusing their efforts on achieving military gains following the end of the rainy season.",
      "The Biden administration has been working with its allies in the region to get them back to the negotiating table, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "\u201cSo we are certainly trying actively with both African and Gulf partners, as well as European allies, and I think that we may or may not see something develop on that soon,\u201d he said."

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian glide bombs, drones and a ballistic missile smashed into cities in southern and eastern Ukraine on Monday, officials said, killing at least six civilians and injuring about 30 others.",
      "Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russia has recently intensified strikes that have long tormented civilian areas, in an apparent effort to unnerve Ukrainians and wear down their willingness to keep up a war that is approaching its 1,000-day milestone.",
      "\u201cEvery day, every night, Russia commits the same terror,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. \u201cExcept that an increasing number of civilian objects are becoming targets.\u201d",
      "Both Russia and Ukraine are waiting to see how Washington will change its policy on the war after Donald Trump takes office as the U.S. president in January. The U.S. is the biggest provider of military help to Ukraine, but Trump has chided the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars of aid.",
      "The Ukrainian army intends to expand its mobile units, which are primarily tasked with shooting down drones, in the regions most frequently targeted by Russian strikes, Zelenskyy said on Telegram.",
      "He also said that Ukraine is working on producing its own glide bombs as part of a domestic missile program. Russian glide bombs have significantly impacted the battlefield, as their destructive power reduces settlements to rubble and makes it increasingly difficult for Ukrainian forces to hold their defensive fortifications.",
      "Ukrainian forces are being slowly pushed backward in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russia is bringing its greater military might to bear. Zelenskyy said Ukraine would conduct a \u201csubstantial reinforcement\u201d in areas near the Donetsk settlements of Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, where Ukraine\u2019s army is in danger of being overrun.",
      "Zelenskyy added that Ukraine is holding its positions in Russia\u2019s Kursk border region, where Western and Ukrainian officials say Russia is being helped by thousands of newly arrived North Korean troops. He said Russia has deployed some 50,000 troops to Kursk.",
      "Also in Donetsk, near the recently captured settlement of Hirnyk, the Russians have damaged a dam at the Kurakhove reservoir, regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said.",
      "The local water level in the Vovcha River has risen by 1.2 meters, though no homes have been affected, and possible flooding threatens both the Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions, he said.",
      "\u201cWe continue to monitor the water level in the river and are prepared for any developments,\u201d Filashkin said.",
      "The development revived memories of the collapse of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine in June 2023, killing hundreds of people. An Associated Press investigation found the collapse was likely caused by Russian forces.",
      "The major cities struck Monday by Russia are close to the approximately 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line.",
      "Russian drones hammered the southern city of Mykolaiv, killing five people and injuring a 45-year-old woman, local authorities said. Around two dozen people sought psychological help following the attack that damaged houses and stores, officials said.",
      "Mykolaiv, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the front line in the Kherson region, frequently comes under Russian attack.",
      "An overnight attack on Zaporizhzhia, also in the south, with three powerful glide bombs killed one person and injured 21, including a 4-year-old boy, Ukraine\u2019s National Police said. The strikes partially destroyed a two-story apartment building and damaged a dormitory.",
      "A five-story apartment building in Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy\u2019s hometown in central Ukraine, was hit by a Russian ballistic missile, injuring at least eight people. The missile destroyed all five stories in one part of the building, said Oleksandr Vikul, head of Kryviy Rih Military Administration.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s intelligence agency claimed in a statement it destroyed a Russian Mi-24 assault helicopter parked at the Klin-5 airfield in the Moscow region. The claim could not be independently verified.",

    "story": [
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has survived a runoff vote against the opposition but will face turmoil ahead amid anger over the ruling party\u2019s financial scandals",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, battered in parliamentary elections last month, has survived a rare runoff vote against the opposition to remain the country's leader but he still faces turmoil ahead.",
      "One of his top priorities is dealing with the aftermath of a major corruption scandal in the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in which dozens of lawmakers from the party are alleged to have pocketed profits from event ticket sales as kickbacks.",
      "Ishiba also now has a much-emboldened, opposition eager to push through policies long stymied by the LDP. Support ratings for his Cabinet have fallen to about 30%.",
      "Here is a look at what's happening in Japan's tumultuous politics, and what it might mean for Ishiba and his government as they prepare to navigate a second term of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "A parliamentary vote for a new leader is mandatory within 30 days of a general election. In the past that was mostly ignored as the head of the LDP usually enjoyed a majority in the Lower House, the more powerful of Japan\u2019s two-chamber parliament.",
      "This time, though, because Ishiba's LDP and its junior coalition partner lost its majority in the recent election, the runoff on Monday couldn't be avoided \u2014 the first in 30 years.",
      "Opposition's top leader, Yoshihiko Noda, has noted that nearly half of all lower house steering committees are now headed by the opposition. That\u2019s a huge change from the pre-election domination of the LDP, which controlled all but three of the 27 committees.",
      "\u201cWe are going to have a new landscape in Japanese politics,\u201d Noda said.",
      "Twelve of the committees in key areas, including budget, political reforms, national security and legal affairs, will be headed by Noda\u2019s Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and two other main opposition groups.",
      "What's certain is that the era of LDP\u2019s one-sided rule is over, for now, and the opposition has a chance to achieve policies long opposed by the ruling conservatives, including on issues like gender equality and diversity.",
      "Noda last Friday said a legal committee that is now headed by his party\u2019s gender equality chief, Chinami Nishimura, is aiming to achieve a civil code revision to allow married couples the option of keeping separate surnames. That change has been stalled by LDP conservatives for 30 years despite widespread support by the public and a United Nations panel on discrimination against women.",
      "Yuichiro Tamaki is head of the conservative Democratic Party for the People, which quadrupled its seats to 28 in the election. The vote elevated his party from a fringe group to a major player.",
      "He is now being cast as a potential key to Ishiba\u2019s survival.",
      "A Harvard-educated former Finance Ministry bureaucrat, the 55-year-old Tamaki has seen success by pushing for the raising of a basic tax-free income allowance and an increase of take-home wages. His messages on social media have appealed to younger voters, who have long been ignored by LDP policies catering to conservative elderly.",
      "Ishiba apparently seems to find Tamaki\u2019s 28-member DPP an attractive partner to secure a majority. The two parties, which have common ground in some areas \u2014 including support for greater nuclear energy use and a stronger military \u2014 have started policy talks.",
      "Ishiba met with both Tamaki and Noda on Monday but Tamaki may be cautious about moving too close to a scandal-plagued LDP ahead of another election next year. Noda is struggling to form a unified opposition to force a change of government, which he says is his next goal.",
      "For Ishiba, the \u201chung parliament\u201d requires him to win over opposition forces so he can push his policies. While considered unstable, it might also provide a chance for a more consensus-based policy making process, experts say.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m taking the current situation positively as a chance to get our opposition voice heard more carefully,\u201d Tamaki said.",
      "Ishiba also faces challenges of restoring unity in his own party. A number of senior LDP lawmakers are waiting to overthrow Ishiba, though their priority is to resolidify their footholds, not infighting \u2014 and nobody is eager to do damage control at this difficult time anyway.",
      "\u201cThe (Ishiba) administration is quite unstable. ... He will have to get opposition parties' cooperation every time he wants to get a bill approved, which could stall policies,\u201d said University of Tokyo political science professor Yu Uchiyama.",
      "And even if Ishiba survives politically in the coming months, there could be a call for his replacement ahead of next elections.",
      "\u201cJapan is likely to return to a period of short-lived government,\u201d Uchiyama said.",
      "Ishiba congratulated Trump hours after his victory and in a brief telephone conversation, they agreed to closely work together to further elevate their alliance.",
      "While experts say Trump understands the importance of U.S.-Japan relations, he may \u2014 as he did in his first administration \u2014 pressure Japan to pay more for the cost of 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan or to buy more expensive American weapons.",
      "Trump's possible tariff proposals could also hurt Japanese exporters.",
      "Ishiba on Saturday renewed his pledge to pursue an ongoing military buildup plan under a strategy that calls for a counter-strike capability with long-range cruise-missiles. He has long advocated a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance but could face difficulty pursuing those plans.",
      "\u201dIt will be a fantastic experiment to see if a national unity government can get Japan through until the next election,\u201d said Michael Cucek, an expert in Japanese politics at Temple University in Japan.",

    "story": [
      "The Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival looks less attractive this year amid a sluggish economy, forcing e-commerce firms to look abroad for growth",
      "HONG KONG -- Businesses and consumers in China found the annual Singles' Day shopping festival less attractive this year amid a sluggish economy, forcing e-commerce firms to look abroad for growth.",
      "Online service provider and e-commerce platform Alibaba started the now-famous event on Nov. 11, 2009, offering attractive discounts to entice shoppers to spend more. The extravaganza, also known as \u201cDouble 11,\u201d has since expanded to other platforms in China \u2014 like JD.com and Pinduoduo \u2014 and abroad.",
      "It has long been regarded as a barometer of consumer sentiment.",
      "While Singles\u2019 Day was previously a one-day event, shopping platforms in China now kickstart the festival weeks ahead to drum up sales volume. Even some brick-and-mortar stores join the festival by launching sales campaigns and hanging promotional banners and posters in the hopes of luring shoppers.",
      "But amid China\u2019s lagging domestic economy, dragged down by a real estate crisis and deflationary pressures, consumers no longer go all out during the shopping extravaganza.",
      "Meanwhile, e-commerce platforms grappling with a slowing domestic market have turned to overseas markets to seek new growth, offering promotions like global free shipping and allowing merchants to sell worldwide with ease.",
      "Alibaba, for example, said in a blog post on its Alizila site that some 70,000 merchants saw sales double with global free shipping. In markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, new customers also doubled, the e-commerce company said.",
      "Since the festival began in late October, \u201cI have only spent a few hundred yuan on daily necessities,\u201d said Wang Haihua, who owns a fitness center in the capital, Beijing.",
      "Wang said that the prices offered on e-commerce platforms during Singles\u2019 Day are not necessarily cheaper than usual. \u201cThey\u2019re all tricks and we\u2019ve seen through it over the years,\u201d she said.",
      "Zhang Jiewei, a 34-year-old who runs a barber shop in the city of Xi\u2019an, echoed Wang\u2019s sentiments, saying that he no longer trusts Singles\u2019 Day promotions as some merchants tend to raise the usual prices before offering a discount, giving consumers the illusion they are getting a deal.",
      "\u201cI used to buy a lot two or three years ago and I even purchased a mobile phone (during Singles\u2019 Day),\u201d he said. However, following the coronavirus pandemic, he stopped \u201cbecause of lower income.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am not going to buy anything this year,\u201d Zhang said.",
      "Some experts say that Beijing\u2019s recent stimulus measures have had little impact on boosting consumer confidence.",
      "\u201cPeople are not interested in spending and are cutting back on big-ticket items,\u201d said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. \u201cSince October 2022, the weak economy means that everything has been on discount year-round, 11.11 is not going to bring in more discounts than the month before.\u201d",
      "Rein said he expects low growth for the Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival as consumers tighten their spending in anticipation of difficult economic times ahead.",
      "Categories such as sportswear and fitness, however, have been doing well as customers \u201ctrade down a Gucci bag for Lululemon sportswear,\u201d he said.",
      "Jacob Cooke, CEO of e-commerce consultancy WPIC Marketing + Technologies, said that despite the luxury downturn, the shopping festival still showed strong sales for goods in premium price brands across categories like mother-baby, personal care and toys, as well as outdoor and sport.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear shift in consumer priorities towards experiences, hobbies, and health,\u201d Cooke said. \u201cWith record-level platform subsidies and generous membership programs like Alibaba\u2019s 88VIP, consumers actually showed a preference for premium branded goods during this year\u2019s festival.\u201d",
      "Platforms like JD.com and Alibaba previously used to publish the total value of the festival's transactions, but have stopped since 2022. While yearly growth used to be in the double digits, estimates of recent figures have dwindled to low single-digit growth.",
      "Syntun, a data provider, estimated that last year\u2019s gross merchandising volume sales across major e-commerce platforms grew just 2% to 1.14 trillion yuan ($156.40 billion), a far cry from double-digit growth before COVID-19.",
      "Alibaba also owns popular e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall,",
      "Even some merchants who typically participated in the festival say the high cost of advertising no longer pays off as sales dwindle.",
      "Zhao Gao, who owns a garment factory in eastern Zhejiang province, said that after paying to advertise on e-commerce platforms, he would only break even after sales.",
      "\u201cThe platforms have so many rules for promotions and customers have become more skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a merchant, I no longer participate in the Singles\u2019 Day promotions.\u201d",
      "Another merchant, Du Baonian who runs a food company processing mutton in Inner Mongolia, said consumers spend less and his overall sales were down by 15% compared to the past year.",
      "He still takes part in the Singles\u2019 Day promotions but said the higher expenses do not typically generate returns because of slow sales.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing shrinking revenue, but advertisement on the platform can help us maintain our leading sales position,\u201d he said, adding that he was considering advertising on more e-commerce platforms to target more consumers.",

      "Toy giant Mattel says it \u201cdeeply\u201d regrets an error on the packaging of its \u201cWicked\u201d movie-themed dolls, which mistakenly links toy buyers to a pornographic website",
      "NEW YORK -- Toy giant Mattel says it \u201cdeeply\u201d regrets an error on the packaging of its \u201cWicked\u201d movie-themed dolls, which mistakenly links toy buyers to a pornographic website.",
      "The error gained attention on social media over the weekend, where numerous users shared photos of the URL printed on the back of the boxes for the special edition dolls, which feature characters from the movie adaptation of \u201cWicked\u201d set to hit theaters later this month. Instead of linking to Universal Pictures' official WickedMovie.com page, the website listed leads to an adult film site that requires consumers to be over 18 to enter.",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Mattel said it was \u201cmade aware of a misprint on the packaging of the Mattel Wicked collection dolls,\" which it said are primarily sold in the U.S. \u201cWe deeply regret this unfortunate error and are taking immediate action to remedy this,\u201d the company added.",
      "Mattel did not confirm whether this action included removing unsold products with the incorrect link from stores. But as of Monday morning, at least some of these \u201cWicked\u201d dolls appeared to be no longer available or not in stock on sites like Amazon, Target and Mattel's.",
      "In the meantime, the company is advising consumers who already have the dolls to discard their packaging or obscure the link \u2014 and contact Mattel's customer service for more information.",
      "Mattel unveiled its special \u201cWicked\u201d collection earlier this year. Back in July, a promotion shared on Instagram showed Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, who star as Elphaba and Glinda in Universal Pictures' upcoming film, seeing the line's singing dolls for the first time.",
      "The beloved Broadway musical has been split into two parts for its movie adaptation. The first chapter of \u201cWicked\u201d will hit theaters on Nov. 22, with part two set for a fall 2025 release."

      "The Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival looks less attractive this year amid a sluggish economy, forcing e-commerce firms to look abroad for growth",
      "HONG KONG -- Businesses and consumers in China found the annual Singles' Day shopping festival less attractive this year amid a sluggish economy, forcing e-commerce firms to look abroad for growth.",
      "Online service provider and e-commerce platform Alibaba started the now-famous event on Nov. 11, 2009, offering attractive discounts to entice shoppers to spend more. The extravaganza, also known as \u201cDouble 11,\u201d has since expanded to other platforms in China \u2014 like JD.com and Pinduoduo \u2014 and abroad.",
      "It has long been regarded as a barometer of consumer sentiment.",
      "While Singles\u2019 Day was previously a one-day event, shopping platforms in China now kickstart the festival weeks ahead to drum up sales volume. Even some brick-and-mortar stores join the festival by launching sales campaigns and hanging promotional banners and posters in the hopes of luring shoppers.",
      "But amid China\u2019s lagging domestic economy, dragged down by a real estate crisis and deflationary pressures, consumers no longer go all out during the shopping extravaganza.",
      "Meanwhile, e-commerce platforms grappling with a slowing domestic market have turned to overseas markets to seek new growth, offering promotions like global free shipping and allowing merchants to sell worldwide with ease.",
      "Alibaba, for example, said in a blog post on its Alizila site that some 70,000 merchants saw sales double with global free shipping. In markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, new customers also doubled, the e-commerce company said.",
      "Since the festival began in late October, \u201cI have only spent a few hundred yuan on daily necessities,\u201d said Wang Haihua, who owns a fitness center in the capital, Beijing.",
      "Wang said that the prices offered on e-commerce platforms during Singles\u2019 Day are not necessarily cheaper than usual. \u201cThey\u2019re all tricks and we\u2019ve seen through it over the years,\u201d she said.",
      "Zhang Jiewei, a 34-year-old who runs a barber shop in the city of Xi\u2019an, echoed Wang\u2019s sentiments, saying that he no longer trusts Singles\u2019 Day promotions as some merchants tend to raise the usual prices before offering a discount, giving consumers the illusion they are getting a deal.",
      "\u201cI used to buy a lot two or three years ago and I even purchased a mobile phone (during Singles\u2019 Day),\u201d he said. However, following the coronavirus pandemic, he stopped \u201cbecause of lower income.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am not going to buy anything this year,\u201d Zhang said.",
      "Some experts say that Beijing\u2019s recent stimulus measures have had little impact on boosting consumer confidence.",
      "\u201cPeople are not interested in spending and are cutting back on big-ticket items,\u201d said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. \u201cSince October 2022, the weak economy means that everything has been on discount year-round, 11.11 is not going to bring in more discounts than the month before.\u201d",
      "Rein said he expects low growth for the Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival as consumers tighten their spending in anticipation of difficult economic times ahead.",
      "Categories such as sportswear and fitness, however, have been doing well as customers \u201ctrade down a Gucci bag for Lululemon sportswear,\u201d he said.",
      "Jacob Cooke, CEO of e-commerce consultancy WPIC Marketing + Technologies, said that despite the luxury downturn, the shopping festival still showed strong sales for goods in premium price brands across categories like mother-baby, personal care and toys, as well as outdoor and sport.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear shift in consumer priorities towards experiences, hobbies, and health,\u201d Cooke said. \u201cWith record-level platform subsidies and generous membership programs like Alibaba\u2019s 88VIP, consumers actually showed a preference for premium branded goods during this year\u2019s festival.\u201d",
      "Platforms like JD.com and Alibaba previously used to publish the total value of the festival's transactions, but have stopped since 2022. While yearly growth used to be in the double digits, estimates of recent figures have dwindled to low single-digit growth.",
      "Syntun, a data provider, estimated that last year\u2019s gross merchandising volume sales across major e-commerce platforms grew just 2% to 1.14 trillion yuan ($156.40 billion), a far cry from double-digit growth before COVID-19.",
      "Alibaba also owns popular e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall,",
      "Even some merchants who typically participated in the festival say the high cost of advertising no longer pays off as sales dwindle.",
      "Zhao Gao, who owns a garment factory in eastern Zhejiang province, said that after paying to advertise on e-commerce platforms, he would only break even after sales.",
      "\u201cThe platforms have so many rules for promotions and customers have become more skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a merchant, I no longer participate in the Singles\u2019 Day promotions.\u201d",
      "Another merchant, Du Baonian who runs a food company processing mutton in Inner Mongolia, said consumers spend less and his overall sales were down by 15% compared to the past year.",
      "He still takes part in the Singles\u2019 Day promotions but said the higher expenses do not typically generate returns because of slow sales.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing shrinking revenue, but advertisement on the platform can help us maintain our leading sales position,\u201d he said, adding that he was considering advertising on more e-commerce platforms to target more consumers.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico is facing a second Donald Trump presidency, and few countries can match its experience as a target of Trump's rhetoric: There have been threats to close the border, impose tariffs and even send U.S. forces to fight Mexican drug cartels if the country doesn\u2019t do more to stem the flow of migrants and drugs.",
      "That\u2019s not to mention what mass deportations of migrants who are in the U.S. illegally could do to remittances \u2014 the money sent home by migrants \u2014 that have become one of Mexico\u2019s main sources of income.",
      "But as much as this second round looks like the first round \u2014 when Mexico pacified Trump by quietly ceding to his immigration demands \u2014 circumstances have changed, and not necessarily for the better. Today, Mexico has in Claudia Sheinbaum a somewhat stern leftist ideologue as president, and Trump is not known for handling such relations well.",
      "Back in 2019, Mexico\u2019s then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was a charismatic, plain-spoken, folksy leader who seemed to understand Trump, because both had a transactional view of politics: You give me what I want, I\u2019ll give you what you want. The two went on to form a chummy relationship.",
      "But while L\u00f3pez Obrador was forged in the give-and-take politics of the often-corrupt former ruling party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, Sheinbaum grew up in a family of leftist activists and got her political experience in radical university student movements.",
      "\u201cClaudia is more ideological than L\u00f3pez Obrador, and so the problem is that I see her potentially responding to Trumpian policies, whether it\u2019s, you know, organized crime or immigration or tariffs with a much more nationalistic, jingoistic view of the relationship,\u201d said Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S. from 2007 to 2013.",
      "Sheinbaum made a point of being one of the first world leaders to call Trump on Thursday to congratulate him after the election, but during the call Trump did two things that may say a lot about how things will go.",
      "First, Sheinbaum said, Trump quickly brought up the border to remind her there were issues there. Then he asked Sheinbaum to send his greetings to L\u00f3pez Obrador, with whom Trump said he had \u201ca very good relationship.\u201d That might suggest that Trump believes that L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2014 the new president's political mentor \u2014 is still in charge, a view shared by some analysts.",
      "Sarukhan said he believes the fact that Sheinbaum is a woman and is from Mexico will be \"a very important challenge, an issue out there as both of them get going in their relationship.\u201d",
      "There's little likelihood that Trump will get caught up in other issues and just forget about Mexico. Karoline Leavitt, the Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman, said Trump had been given \"a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver.\u201d",
      "Not everything has changed for the worse: Cross-border trade has topped $800 billion per year and U.S. companies are more dependent than ever on Mexican plants.",
      "But the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, or USMCA, is coming up for review, and Mexico has made legal changes that Trump could seize on to demand a re-negotiation of parts of the deal.",
      "Sheinbaum has suggested Mexico won't give in even if backed into a corner, saying \u201cwe obviously are going to address any problems that come up with dialogue, as a collaborative process, and if not, we are going to stand up, we are prepared to do that with great unity.\u201d",
      "Standing up hasn\u2019t worked particularly well before. In 2018, Marcelo Ebrard was Mexico\u2019s top diplomat; former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Ebrard basically bent to U.S. demands to keep asylum seekers in Mexico and accept migrants back even if they weren\u2019t Mexicans.",
      "Ebrard just asked that the deal not be made public to avoid embarrassing L\u00f3pez Obrador, Pompeo wrote. (Ebrard later claimed he had avoided signing a much worse \"safe third country\u2019\" agreement.)",
      "Today, Ebrard is Mexico\u2019s economy secretary, and would lead Mexico\u2019s delegation in the scheduled 2026 review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, something that Trump has greeted with mirth (\"I've never seen anybody fold like that,\" Trump once said of Ebrard.)",
      "Ebrard on Thursday downplayed any risks this time around, saying e conomic ties between the two countries would keep Trump from closing borders or imposing tariffs.",
      "\u201cI am optimistic. Unlike other countries, we are the largest trading partner (of the U.S.), so, if you put up a tariff, that will have repercussions in the United States,\u201d Ebrard said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it is going to be easy, because it is not at all easy, but the relationship with President Trump will be good because, what unites us? These numbers, this gigantic economy.\u201d",
      "But some former diplomats say any argument that Mexico can avoid friction with the Trump administration is overconfident, and that 2025 is not necessarily going to be like 2019.",
      "Martha B\u00e1rcena, Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. from 2018 to 2021, said she doesn't think Trump would back away from campaign promises to deport migrants who are in the country illegally. She said Mexican officials who believe Trump might temper his \u201ccampaign promises because Mexican migrants are necessary for the U.S. economy\u201d are being overly optimistic.",
      "\u201cMexico is looking at it through the lens of economic logic. The logic that the Trump campaign applies on immigration is a logic of national security and cultural identity issues,\" B\u00e1rcena said.",
      "Some of Trump's biggest policy concerns \u2013 restoring U.S. jobs and the increasing rivalry with China \u2014 also run through Mexico.",
      "U.S. and foreign automakers have set up dozens of plants in Mexico, and some in the U.S. worry that Chinese companies could do the same to take advantage of existing trade rules to export Chinese cars or auto parts to the United States.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help that Sheinbaum has pushed through L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policies aimed at eliminating independent regulatory and oversight bodies, and laws the U.S. government says could reduce the independence of the judiciary, both of which are required under the USMCA trade agreement.",
      "\u201cIf they go ahead with the elimination of independent regulators and autonomous bodies, that\u2019s going to be a further violation of the USMCA,\u201d Sarukhan said. \u201cAnd then that\u2019s going to make things even worse. Obviously, the big piece is going to be China and the Chinese footprint in Mexico.\u201d",
      "That could lead Trump to demand the re-negotiation of all auto industry agreements under the trade pact.",
      "As far as efforts to jointly combat the illegal drug trade \u2014 such cooperation fell to historic lows in 2019 and 2020 \u2014 there have been some modestly encouraging signs. Last week, Mexico announced the seizure in Tijuana of over 300,000 fentanyl pills after months when t he country\u2019s entire seizures had amounted to as little as 50 grams \u2014 a couple of ounces \u2014 per week.",
      "Sheinbaum, who took office on Oct. 1, also appears to be tacitly abandoning L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s strategy of not confronting drug cartels. But neither she nor her predecessor and political mentor could ever accept any Trump plan to send U.S. forces to operate independently on Mexican soil.",
      "It remains to see how far Trump might go; he often makes only token gestures to carry through on threats. But Sarukhan noted, \u201cI do think that he will talk loudly and carry a big stick.\u201d",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A Dutch appeals court on Tuesday overturned a landmark ruling that ordered energy company Shell to cut its carbon emissions by net 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels.",
      "The decision was a defeat for the Dutch arm of environmental group Friends of the Earth, which hailed the original 2021 ruling as a victory for the climate. Tuesday's civil ruling can be appealed to the Dutch Supreme Court.",
      "The ruling upholding Shell's appeal came as a 12-day U.N. climate conference was entering its second day in Azerbaijan.",
      "Presiding Judge Carla Joustra said that Shell already has targets for climate-warming carbon emissions that are in line with demands of Friends of the Earth \u2014 both for what it directly produces and for emissions produced by energy the company purchase from others. And she added that an order for Shell to cut emissions by people and businesses who buy its products would be unlikely to have an effect as the products could be sold by another company.",
      "\u201cThe court\u2019s final judgment is that Friends of the Earth's claims cannot be granted. The court therefore annuls the district court\u2019s judgment,\u201d Joustra said.",
      "\u201cThis hurts,\" Friends of the Earth director in the Netherlands Donald Pols said. \"At the same time, we see that this case has ensured that major polluters are not immune and has further stimulated the debate about their responsibility in combating dangerous climate change. That is why we continue to tackle major polluters, such as Shell.\u201d"

      "\u201cAre we facing new headwinds? Absolutely. But we won\u2019t revert back to the energy system of the 1950s. No way,\u201d Podesta said.",
      "\u201cSetbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,\u201d Podesta said paraphrasing a Biden speech last week. \u201cThis is not the end of our fight for a cleaner, safer planet. Facts are still facts. Science is still science. The fight is bigger than one election, one political cycle in one country. This fight is bigger, still, because we are all living through a year defined by the climate crisis in every country of the world.\u201d",
      "During the campaign, Trump said would pull America from the Paris Agreement, rollback parts of the IRA and increase drilling and oil production. He has called emissions regulations part of a \u201cgreen new scam\u201d and claimed, without evidence, that offshore wind turbines harm whales.",
      "During Trump's first administration, between 2017 and 2021, many environmental regulations were rolled back, later to be reversed by the Biden administration. The incoming Trump administration has signaled it plans to now undo Biden's changes.",
      "During his press conference, Podesta ran through a shopping list of climate disasters, starting with the hottest day recorded, July 22, continuing with floods, hurricanes and droughts.",
      "\u201cNone of this is a hoax. It is real. It\u2019s a matter of life and death,\u201d Podesta said. \u201cFortunately, many in our country and around the world are working to prepare the world for this new reality and to mitigate the most catastrophic effects of climate change.\u201d",
      "Podesta said the Biden administration is still negotiating even as it prepares to leave.",
      "\u201cWe are here to work, and we are committed to a successful outcome at COP29,\" Podesta said. \u201cWe can and will make real progress on the backs of our climate committed states and cities, our innovators, our companies and our citizens, especially young people who understand more than most that climate change poses an existential threat that we cannot afford to ignore.\u201d",
      "Another senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said other countries are still working with American diplomats because they care what the U.S. thinks and any agreement struck here must be by consensus. Outside analysts had speculated the U.S. would be ignored.",
      "\u201cIn January, we\u2019re going to inaugurate a president whose relationship to climate change is captured by the words \u2018hoax\u2019 and \u2018fossil fuels\u2019,\u201d Podesta said. \u201cHe\u2019s vowed to dismantle our environmental safeguards and once again withdraw United States from the Paris Agreement. That is what he said. And we should believe him.\u201d",

    "summary": "Experts calculate that curbing and coping with global warming is going to cost trillions of dollars and poor nations just don&rsquo;t have it",
    "story": [
      "Experts calculate that curbing and coping with global warming is going to cost trillions of dollars and poor nations just don\u2019t have it",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- A complex international two-week-long game of climate change poker is convening. The stakes? Just the fate of an ever-warming world.",
      "Curbing and coping with climate change's worsening heat, floods, droughts and storms will cost trillions of dollars and poor nations just don't have it, numerous reports and experts calculate. As United Nations climate negotiations started Monday in Baku, Azerbaijan, the chief issue is who must ante up to help poor nations and especially how much.",
      "The numbers are enormous. The floor in negotiations is the $100 billion a year that poor nations \u2014 based on a categorization made in the 1990s \u2014 now get as part of a 2009 agreement that was barely met. Several experts and poorer nations say the need is $1 trillion a year or more.",
      "\u201cIt's a game with high stakes,\u201d said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, a physicist. \u201cRight now the fate of the planet depends very much on what we're able to pull off in the next five or 10 years.\u201d",
      "But this year's talks, known as COP29, won't be as high-profile as last year's, with 48 fewer heads of state scheduled to speak. The leaders of the top two carbon polluting countries \u2014 China and the United States \u2014 will be absent. But if money negotiations fail in Baku, it will handicap 2025\u2019s make-or-break climate negotiations, experts say.",
      "Not only is dealing with money always a touchy subject, but two of the rich countries that are expected to donate money to poor nations \u2014 the United States and Germany \u2014 are in the midst of dramatic government changes. Even though the United States delegation will be from Biden Administration, the reelection of Donald Trump, who downplays climate change and dislikes foreign aid, makes U.S. pledges unlikely to be fulfilled.",
      "The overarching issue is climate finance. Without it, experts say the world can't get a handle on fighting warming, nor can most of the nations achieve their current carbon pollution-cutting goals or the new ones they will submit next year.",
      "\u201cIf we don't solve the finance problem, then definitely we will not solve the climate problem,\u201d said former Colombian deputy climate minister Pablo Vieira, who heads the support unit at NDC Partnership, which helps nations with emissions-cutting goals.",
      "Nations can't cut carbon pollution if they can't afford to eliminate coal, oil and gas, Vieira and several other experts said. Poor nations are frustrated that they are being told to do more to fight climate change when they cannot afford it, he said. And the 47 poorest nations only created 4% of the heat-trapping gases in the air, according to the U.N.",
      "About 77% of the heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere now comes from the G20 rich nations, many of whom are now cutting back on their pollution, something that is not happening in most poor nations or China.",
      "\u201cThe countries that are rich today have become rich by polluting the Earth,\u201d said Ani Dasgupta, president of World Resources Institute.",
      "The money being discussed is for three things: Helping poor nations switch from dirty fossil fuels to clean energy; helping them adapt to the impacts of a warming world such as sea level rise and worsening storms; and compensating vulnerable poor nations for climate change damage.",
      "\u201cShould the global community fail to reach a (finance) goal, this is really just signing the death warrant of many developing countries,\" said Chukwumerije Okereke, director of the Center for Climate Change and Development in Nigeria.",
      "Michael Wilkins, a business professor who heads Imperial College's Centre for Climate Finance and Investment in the U.K., said since 2022 total climate finance has been nearly $1.5 trillion. But only 3% of that is actually geared toward the least developed countries, he said.",
      "\u201cThe Global South has been repeatedly let down by unmet pledges and commitments,\u201d said Sunita Narain, director general of New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment.",
      "\u201cFinance is really the key component that compels all types of climate action,\u201d said Bahamian climate scientist Adelle Thomas, adaptation director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cWithout that finance, there's simply not much that developing countries in particular can do.\u201d",
      "It's an issue of both self-interest and justice, Thomas and others said. It's not charity to help poor nations decarbonize because rich nations benefit when all countries cut emissions. After all, a warming world hurts everyone.",
      "Compensating for climate damage and helping nations prepare for future harm is a matter of justice, Thomas said. Even though they didn't create the problem, poor nations \u2014 especially small island nations \u2014 are particularly vulnerable to climate change's rising seas and extreme weather. Thomas mentioned how 2019's Hurricane Dorian smacked her grandparents home and \u201cthe only thing left standing was one toilet.\u201d",
      "The trillion-dollar figure on the table is about half of what the world spends annually on the military. Others say global fossil fuel subsidies could be redirected to climate finance; estimates of those subsidies range from the International Energy Agency\u2019s $616 billion a year to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s $7 trillion a year.",
      "\u201cWhen we need more for other things, including conflict, we seem to find it,\u201d United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said. \u201cWell, this is probably the largest conflict of all.\u201d",
      "A U.N. climate finance committee report looked at the need from 98 countries and estimated it as ranging from $455 billion to $584 billion per year.",
      "The money isn't just direct government aid from one nation to another. Some of it comes from multinational development finance banks, like the World Bank. There's also private investment that will be considered a large chunk. Developing nations are seeking relief from their $29 trillion global debt.",
      "Andersen said at least a sixfold increase in investment would be required to get on the path to limit future warming to just another two-tenths of a degree Celsius (0.4 degrees Fahrenheit) from now, which is the overarching goal the world adopted in 2015.",
      "Andersen's agency calculated that with nations' current emissions-curbing targets, the difference between well-financed and current efforts translates to half a degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) less future warming. Experts say stepped-up efforts that could reduce future warming even more also costs more.",
      "Who will pay is another sticking point. Climate talks for decades have used 1992 standards to categorize two groups of nations, essentially rich and poor, deciding that rich nations like the U.S. are the ones to financially help poor ones. Financial circumstances have changed. China, the world\u2019s top carbon polluter, has increased its per capita GDP by more than 30 times since then. But neither China nor some rich oil nations are obligated to help in climate finance.",
      "Developed nations want those countries that couldn't afford to give before, but now can, included in the next round of donors. But those nations don't want those obligations, said E3G analyst Alden Meyer, a climate negotiations veteran.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very fraught landscape to think about huge scale-up of existing climate finance,\u201d Meyer said.",

      "Elon Musk\u2019s super PAC spent around $200 million to help elect Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Elon Musk's super PAC spent around $200 million to help elect Donald Trump, according to a person familiar with the group's spending, funding an effort that set a new standard for how billionaires can influence elections.",
      "The billionaire Tesla and SpaceX CEO provided the vast majority of the money to America PAC, which focused on low-propensity and first-time voters, according to the person, who was not authorized to disclose the figure publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "America PAC\u2019s work was aided by a March ruling from the Federal Election Commission that paved the way for super PACs to coordinate their canvassing efforts with campaigns, allowing the Trump campaign to rely on the near-unlimited money of the nation\u2019s most high-profile billionaire to boost turnout in deep-red parts of the country. That allowed the campaign to spend the money they saved on everything from national ad campaigns to targeted outreach toward demographics Democrats once dominated.",
      "The plan worked for both sides. Trump saw key turnout surges in battleground states, and at the end of the campaign the president-elect credited Musk\u2019s role in the race. \u201cWe have a new star,\u201d Trump said at his election night party in Florida. \u201cA star is born \u2014 Elon!\u201d",
      "\u201cThe FEC ruling cleared the way for us to gain more benefit from soft money enterprises that were going out and doing this work anyway,\u201d said James Blair, the Trump campaign\u2019s political director.",
      "Blair worked as the main bridge between the Trump operation and groups like America PAC \u2014 a far cry from the early days of super PACs having to decide their strategy without communicating officially with the campaigns they were backing.",
      "\u201cBy conserving hard dollars, we were able to go wider and deeper on paid voter contact and advertising programs,\u201d Blair said. That, he added, included broad ad campaigns aimed at a national audience, as well as \u2014 critically \u2014 more targeted campaigns looking to boost turnout among Black and Latino men, two areas where Trump saw sweeping gains in 2024.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just Musk\u2019s money that helped Trump. The billionaire businessman became one of Trump\u2019s highest-profile surrogates in the final months of the campaign, often joining the former president onstage. His support gave Trump a clear opening into the universe of younger men who look up to Musk.",
      "Trump also benefited from Musk\u2019s ownership of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, and the company\u2019s work to end many of the rules that hampered Trump before he was kicked off in 2021. Like many conservatives, Musk is a fierce critic of social media efforts to counter disinformation, arguing that those efforts amount to pro-government censorship.",
      "Musk is now expected to play a key role in a second Trump administration. The president-elect has said he will place Musk, whose rocket company works with the Defense Department and intelligence agencies, in charge of a new government efficiency commission.",
      "The work between the Trump campaign and America PAC has potentially longer-lasting implications.",
      "It could yield a wholesale shift in the way presidential races are run, overturning longstanding conventional wisdom about campaigns lacking total control of their field program, the impact billionaires can have in politics and the effectiveness of paid canvassing operations.",
      "One reason for skepticism is that this model had failed spectacularly for past campaigns, most notably during Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 run in the 2024 Republican presidential primary against Trump.",
      "DeSantis, more than any other candidate in the primary, relied on an outside group to buttress his campaign. The group, Never Back Down, was beset by internal issues, and despite spending $130 million to tout the Florida governor, it was swamped by Trump and his campaign operation in Iowa.",
      "One of the most persistent issues, however, was the blurring of lines around what is legally permissible between the campaign and the outside group, an issue that worried some within the governor\u2019s official campaign.",
      "That, however, was before the FEC ruling, meaning Trump and Musk\u2019s group were operating in an entirely different universe than a few months earlier during the primary.",
      "The ruling \u201callowed a much more direct line of communication regarding canvassing,\u201d Blair said. \u201cThat is a real difference and a critical difference.\u201d",
      "Musk's outside group was founded in May, but it wasn\u2019t until Musk endorsed Trump in July, after the former president survived an assassination attempt, that the group more clearly began its turnout work. A week later, in an interview with a conservative podcaster, Musk acknowledged the new committee and a host of top Republican operatives with ties to DeSantis joined the effort.",
      "The group ran ads that warned if people sat out the election, \u201cKamala and the crazies will win.\u201d The highest-profile part of America PAC\u2019s work was a $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes that landed the group in court before a judge said it was allowed to continue. The sweepstakes and subsequent court case drew considerable attention, but much of America PAC\u2019s work happened under the radar.",
      "Door knocking was arguably America PAC\u2019s most impactful work, with Trump experiencing boosts in turnout in key rural areas in battleground states. The work, however, was not without controversy.",
      "A report from The Guardian found America PAC\u2019s efforts were rife with paid canvassers faking their work and saying they had knocked on doors that they had not visited. Multiple reports from Wired alleged that some of those paid canvassers worked in poor conditions, including riding in the back of a rented U-Haul van and facing threats to meet unfeasible quotas. Canvassers were fired after the Wired report, leading to a lawsuit against America PAC.",
      "A spokesperson for America PAC declined to comment on the record for this story.",
      "Musk, meanwhile, indicated in an election night conversation on X that his PAC will stay involved in politics, \u201cpreparing for the midterms and any intermediate elections, as well as looking at elections at the District Attorney and sort of judicial levels.\u201d"

      "U.S. auto safety regulators are investigating complaints that engines can fail on as many as 1.4 million Honda and Acura vehicles",
      "DETROIT -- The U.S. government's highway safety agency is investigating complaints that engines can fail on as many as 1.4 million Honda and Acura vehicles.",
      "The probe by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration covers the 2016 through 2020 Honda Pilot and Acura MDX, as well as the 2018 through 2020 Honda Odyssey and Acura TLX. Also included is the 2017 through 2019 Honda Ridgeline.",
      "The agency says in documents posted on its website Monday that connecting rod bearings on vehicles with 3.5-liter V6 engines can fail, leading to complete engine failure. Connecting rods link the pistons to the crankshaft and convert vertical motion to move the wheels.",
      "Honda recalled about 250,000 vehicles in November of 2023 to fix the same problem. But the agency says it has 173 complaints from owners who reported connecting rod bearing failures, yet their vehicles weren't included in the recall. One owner reported a crash with no injuries.",
      "The agency said it's opening a recall query to determine the severity of the problem in vehicles not included in the 2023 recall.",
      "Honda said it will cooperate with NHTSA on the investigation.",
      "In documents explaining the 2023 recall, the automaker said had 1,450 warranty claims due to the bearing problem but no reports of injuries. Dealers were to inspect and repair or replace the engines if needed.",

    "story": [
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is considering ways to revive a program that would charge drivers a toll to enter parts of Manhattan",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- A $15 toll on vehicles entering the busiest parts of New York City could be revived, as the state's Democratic governor considers enacting the program before President-elect Donald Trump takes office and can block it.",
      "In the days since Trump's victory, Gov. Kathy Hochul and her staff have been reaching out to state lawmakers to gauge support for resuscitating the plan \u2014 known as \u201ccongestion pricing\u201d \u2014 with a lower price tag, according to two people familiar with the outreach. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were revealing private conversations.",
      "Hochul halted the plan to ease gridlock and pump billions into mass transit just weeks before it was set to launch this summer. All the costly infrastructure such as license plate readers was already in place.",
      "At the time, she said she worried it would cost motorists too much money, but it was also widely seen as a political move to help Democrats in closely watched congressional races in the city\u2019s suburbs. The fee would come on top of the already hefty tolls to enter the city via some river crossings, and Republicans were expected to use it as a cudgel in an election heavily focused on cost-of-living issues.",
      "Some of those Democrats ended up winning. But so did Trump, who has vowed to terminate congestion pricing once he returns to the Oval Office in less than two months.",
      "Hochul long insisted the program would eventually reemerge, but previously offered no clear plan for that \u2014 or to replace the billions of dollars in was supposed to generate to help New York City's ailing public transit system.",
      "Now the governor has floated idea of lowering the toll from $15 down to $9 for most people driving passenger vehicles into Manhattan below 60th Street, according to the two people. Her office suggested that a new internet sales tax or payroll tax could help to make up the money lost by lowering the fee, one of the people said.",
      "A spokesman for Hochul declined to comment and pointed to public remarks the governor made last week when she said: \u201cConversations with the federal government are not new. We\u2019ve had conversations \u2014 ongoing conversations \u2014 with the White House, the DOT, the Federal Highway Administration, since June.\u201d",
      "A key question hanging over the process is whether lowering the toll amount would require the federal government to conduct a lengthy environmental review of the program, potentially delaying the process into the incoming administration's term. The program, which state lawmakers approved in 2019, stalled for years awaiting such a review during the first Trump administration.",
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation did not immediately return an emailed request for comment.",
      "Laura Gillen, a Democrat who last week won a close election for a House seat on Long Island just outside the city, responded to the congestion pricing news with dismay.",
      "\u201cWe need a permanent end to congestion pricing efforts, full stop. Long Island commuters cannot afford another tax,\u201d Gillen wrote on the social media site X after Politico New York first reported on the governor's efforts to restart the toll program.",
      "Andrew Albert, a member of the MTA board, said he supported the return of the fee but worried that $9 would not be enough to achieve the policy\u2019s goals.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't raise enough money, it doesn\u2019t clear enough cars off the streets or make the air clean enough,\u201d he said.",

      "As money continues to pour into crypto following Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, bitcoin has climbed to yet another record high",
      "NEW YORK -- As money continues to pour into crypto following Donald Trump's victory last week, bitcoin has climbed to yet another record high.",
      "The world's largest cryptocurrency topped $87,000 for the first time on Monday. As of around 3:45 p.m. ET, bitcoin's price stood at $87,083, per CoinDesk, up over 28% in the last week alone.",
      "That's part of a rally across cryptocurrencies and crypto-related investments since Trump won the U.S. presidential election last week. Analysts credit much of the recent gains to an anticipated \u201ccrypto-friendly\u201d nature of the incoming administration, which could translate into more regulatory clarity but also leeway.",
      "Still, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is hard to predict. And while some are bullish, others continue to warn of investment risks.",
      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now, but has come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, and reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "A lot of it has to do with the outcome of last week's election.",
      "Trump was previously a crypto skeptic, but changed his mind and embraced cryptocurrencies during this year's presidential race. He has pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for. And Trump had previously promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "\u201cCrypto rallied as Election Day progressed into the night and as it became increasingly clear that Trump would emerge victorious,\u201d Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a Friday research note, pointing to larger industry sentiment around Trump being \u201ccrypto-friendly\" and a potential shift in regulatory backing.",
      "Even before the post-election rally, assets like bitcoin posted notable gains over the past year or so. Much of the credit goes to early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\u201d Glass and Saunders noted. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Crypto assets like bitcoin have a history of drastic swings in value \u2014 which can come suddenly and happen over the weekend or overnight in trading that continues at all hours, every day.",
      "In short, history shows you can lose money as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. Then came the 2022 collapse of FTX, which significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall.",
      "At the start of last year, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000. Investors, however, began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. While some crypto supporters see the potential for more record-breaking days, experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "\u201cInvestors should only dabble in crypto with money that they can be prepared to lose,\u201d Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said last week. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve seen these wild swings in the past.\u201d",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \u201cmining,\" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth\u2019s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin\u2019s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",
      "In the U.S., the Energy Information Administration notes that crypto mining across the country has \u201cgrown very rapidly over the last several years,\" adding that grid planners have begun to express concern over increases in related electricity demand. Preliminary estimates released by the EIA in February suggest that annual electricity use from crypto mining probably represents between 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.",
      "Environmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections from regulators around the world.",

      "Southwest Airlines is offering buyouts and extended leaves of absence to airport workers to avoid what it calls \u201coverstaffing in certain locations,\" which it blames on a shortage of new planes from Boeing.",
      "The move on Monday comes as a hedge fund presses Southwest to increase profits and boost the stock price, which has fallen sharply since early 2021.",
      "A Southwest spokesperson said the offers of \u201cvoluntary separation\u201d are limited to 18 airports. The company declined to identify the airports or say how many jobs it hopes to eliminate.",
      "All the targeted jobs are in ground operations, including customer service agents, baggage handlers and cargo workers. Pilots and flight attendants are not included in the buyout offer, the spokesperson said.",
      "Southwest officials have said that the Dallas-based airline plans to end this year with 2,000 fewer workers than it started. That is after Southwest grew from 66,600 to nearly 75,000 employees last year. The figures count part-timers as one-half.",
      "\u201cSouthwest has reduced overall capacity to meet demand with a constrained fleet due to aircraft delivery delays,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cOffering voluntary separation and extended time off to contract and noncontract employees, along with continued slowed hiring, will help us avert overstaffing in certain locations.\u201d",
      "Southwest had originally expected about 85 new Boeing 737 jets this year but has cut that number to 20 because of production problems at Boeing that began after a panel blew out of the side of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max during a flight in January.",
      "The Southwest fleet consists solely of Boeing 737s, including the Max and older versions of the plane.",
      "Starting in June, hedge fund Elliott Investment Management built an 11% stake in Southwest and pressed the airline to improve its financial performance. The two sides reached a truce last month to avoid a proxy fight, but Elliott won several seats on the Southwest board, which it can use to keep pressure on CEO Robert Jordan and other executives.",
      "Even before Elliott, Southwest limited hiring and stopped flying to several airports to save money. It also announced plans to target premium travelers.",
      "Southwest shares rose 3% Monday and are up 13% this year. That is far behind the 117% jump at Delta Air Lines and the 58% gain at United Airlines."

      "There are now more deer in England than at any other time in the last 1,000 years",
      "WINCHESTER, England -- In the half-light of dusk, Martin Edwards surveys the shadows of the ancient woodland from a high seat and waits. He sits still, watching with his thermal camera.",
      "Even the hares don\u2019t seem to notice the deer stalker until he takes aim. The bang of his rifle pierces the stillness. He\u2019s killed a buck, one of many wild deer roaming this patch of forest in Hampshire, southern England.",
      "Edwards advocates humane deer management: the culling of deer to control their numbers and ensure they don\u2019t overrun forests and farmland in a country where they no longer have natural predators. For these advocates, shooting deer is much more than a sport. It\u2019s a necessity because England's deer population has gotten out of control.",
      "There are now more deer in England than at any other time in the last 1,000 years, according to the Forestry Commission, the government department looking after England\u2019s public woodland.",
      "That has had a devastating impact on the environment, officials say. Excessive deer foraging damages large areas of woodland including young trees, as well as the habitats of certain birds like robins. Some landowners have lost huge amounts of crops to deer, and overpopulation means that the mammals are more likely to suffer from starvation and disease.",
      "\u201cThey will produce more young every year. We\u2019ve got to a point where farmers and foresters are definitely seeing that impact,\u201d said Edwards, pointing to some young hazel shrubs with half-eaten buds. \u201cIf there\u2019s too many deer, you will see that they\u2019ve literally eaten all the vegetation up to a certain height.\u201d",
      "Forestry experts and businesses argue that culling the deer \u2014 and supplying the meat to consumers \u2014 is a double win: It helps rebalance the ecosystem and provides a low-fat, sustainable protein.",
      "While venison \u2014 a red meat similar to lean beef but with an earthier flavor \u2014 is often perceived as a high-end food in the U.K., one charity sees it as an ideal protein for those who can\u2019t afford to buy other meats.",
      "\u201cWhy not utilize that fantastic meat to feed people in need?\u201d said SJ Hunt, chief executive of The Country Food Trust, which distributes meals made with wild venison to food banks.",
      "An estimated 2 million deer now roam England\u2019s forests.",
      "The government says native wild deer play a role in healthy forest ecosystems, but acknowledges that their population needs managing. It provides some funding for solutions such as building deer fences.",
      "But experts like Edwards, a spokesman for the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, believe lethal control is the only effective option, especially after deer populations surged during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The pandemic was a boon to deer because hunters, like everyone else, stayed home and the restaurant market \u2014 the main outlet for venison in the U.K. \u2014 vanished overnight.",
      "\u201cThere were no sales of venison and the price was absolutely on the floor,\u201d said Ben Rigby, a leading venison and game meats wholesaler. \u201cThe deer had a chance to breed massively.\u201d",
      "Rigby\u2019s company now processes hundreds of deer a week, turning them into diced venison or steaks for restaurants and supermarkets. One challenge, he said, is growing the domestic appetite for venison so it appears on more dinner plates, especially after Brexit put new barriers up for exporting the meat.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not really a game-eating nation, not like in France or Germany or Scandinavia,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the U.K. is becoming more and more aware of it and our trade is growing.\u201d",
      "Shooting deer is legal but strictly regulated in England. Stalkers must have a license, use certain kinds of firearms and observe open seasons. They also need a valid reason, such as when a landowner authorizes them to kill the deer when their land is damaged. Hunting deer with packs of dogs is illegal.",
      "Making wild venison more widely available in supermarkets and beyond will motivate more stalkers to cull the deer and ensure the meat doesn\u2019t go to waste, Edwards said.",
      "Forestry England, which manages public forests, is part of that drive. In recent years it supplied some hospitals with 1,000 kg (1.1 tons) of wild venison, which became the basis of pies and casseroles popular with patients and staff, it said.",
      "The approach appears to have been well received, though it has attracted some criticism from animal welfare group PETA, which advocates veganism.",
      "Hunt, the food charity chief, said there\u2019s potential to do much more with the meat, which she described as nutritious and \u201cfree-range to the purest form of that definition.\u201d",
      "Her charity distributed hundreds of thousands of pouches of venison Bolognese meals to food banks last year \u2014 and people are hungry for more, she said.",
      "She recalled attending one food bank session where the only protein available was tinned sardines, tinned baked beans and the venison meals.",
      "\u201cThere were no eggs. There was no cheese. That\u2019s all that they could do, and people were just saying, \u2019Thank you, please bring more (of the venison),\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic, because people realize they\u2019re doing a double positive with helping the environment by utilizing the meat as well.\u201d"

      "The Arizona Corporation Commission announced Friday that it reached a consent agreement with Southwest Gas that includes the civil penalty and requires more inspections.",
      "At issue is piping that can degrade in locations with hot ambient temperatures. Federal regulators issued an advisory in 2012 alerting operators that the piping \u2014 known as Driscopipe polyethylene (PE) M7000 and M8000 \u2014 could be susceptible to degradation.",

      "Southwest Gas estimates there are more than 10,000 miles (16,100 kilometers) of the piping throughout Arizona. The utility says it has a plan to target high-risk areas for replacement or abandonment.",
      "The agreement between state regulators and Southwest Gas stems from two separate incidents in 2021, including one in Chandler in which an explosion injured four people.",
      "In addition to replacing or abandoning all newly discovered and previously unmapped spots that contain the defective piping, Southwest Gas must also notify regulators of any leaks.",
      "An amendment to the agreement that was proposed by Corporation Commissioner Kevin Thompson made clear that the company would have to propose new rates \u2014 and win regulatory approval through an administrative process \u2014 if it wants to recoup from customers any of the costs associated with fulfilling the agreement.",
      "\u201cThis matter has been before the commission long enough and the approval of this settlement is a big step in the direction of maintaining public safety and holding the utility accountable,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe customers should bear the entire responsibility for the mistakes of the manufacturer and their defective products, and I wish the utility would have pursued this path more aggressively when they had the chance.\u201d",
      "Southwest Gas also agreed to increase leak patrols throughout the year."

      "International mega banks, funded by taxpayer dollars, are the biggest, fastest-growing source of climate finance for the developing world",
      "As climate change leads to a seemingly endless stream of weather disasters around the world, countries are struggling to adapt to the new reality. Preparing to better withstand hurricanes, floods, heat waves, droughts and wildfires will take hundreds of billions of dollars.",
      "And then there is confronting the root cause of climate change \u2014 the burning of fossil fuels like coal, gas and oil \u2014 by transitioning to clean energies like wind and solar.",
      "That will take trillions of dollars.",
      "Enter climate finance, a term for how to pay for projects to adapt to and combat the cause of climate change. It's especially important for developing countries, which don't have the same resources or access to credit that rich countries do.",
      "International mega banks, funded by taxpayer dollars, are the biggest, fastest-growing source of climate finance for the developing world. Called multilateral development banks because they get contributions from various countries, there are only a handful of these banks in the world, the World Bank the largest among them.",
      "The banks were a key reason why, in 2022, the world met a goal countries had set in 2009 to supply developing nations with $100 billion annually to address climate change.",
      "At the annual U.N. climate conference that opens Monday in Azerbaijan, global leaders are expected to discuss how to generate trillions of dollars for climate finance. The nonprofit research group Climate Policy Initiative estimates the world needs about five times the current annual amount of climate financing to limit warming to 1.5 C (2.7 degrees F) since the late 1800s. Currently, global average temperatures are about 1.3 C (2.3 degrees F) higher.",
      "A new goal needs to reach higher and hold institutions and governments accountable to their promises, said Tim Hirschel-Burns, an expert at Boston University's Global Development Policy Center.",
      "\"The core of it is getting a goal that is going to catalyze the actions that fills the really significant climate finance gap,\u201d he said.",
      "The debate has also shifted to the question of where the money will come from, said Dharshan Wignarajah, director of Climate Policy Initiative\u2019s London-based office.",
      "\u201cUltimately it comes down to who pays,\u201d said Wignarajah, who helped lead the climate talks, called the Conference of Parties, when the United Kingdom was host in 2021. \u201cThat has forced finance to be ever-more prominent at the COP discussions.\u201d",
      "Developing nations are much more reliant on these banks for financing climate projects than industrialized countries.",
      "In the U.S. and Canada, commercial banks and corporations provided funding for more than half of climate-friendly projects in 2022, according to Climate Policy Initiative. In sub-Saharan Africa, those private lenders only accounted for 7%.",
      "This is because it is harder for developing countries to get low interest rates.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re Kenya, and you want to borrow from private lenders, they might charge you 10% interest rates because your credit rating isn\u2019t very good,\u201d Hirschel-Burns said.",
      "But the multilateral banks have better credit ratings than many countries do. For example, the International Development Association \u2014 an arm of the World Bank and the top international aid provider to Kenya \u2014 has the highest possible rating from Moody\u2019s Investor Service, while Kenya itself has a junk rating.",
      "The banks borrow money with that better rating, then lend to developing countries in turn, offering a more reasonable rate than governments could get if they borrowed directly from private lenders.",
      "The multilateral banks\u2019 development seek to improve people's health and the environment, expand energy access and end poverty. It means the banks have also provided billions of dollars for fossil fuel power plants, according to an AP analysis, though their policies have improved and fewer such projects have been funded in recent years.",
      "Investment in fossil fuels continues to rise worldwide, reaching $1.1 trillion in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency. And multilateral banks continue to rank among the biggest funders of fossil fuel-prolonging projects, helping to \u201clock in a high-carbon pathway\u201d for countries, according to a report by the Clean Air Fund, which lobbies for the funding of projects to improve air quality.",
      "\u201cIt should be assisting countries to leapfrog,\u201d said Jane Burston, CEO of the Clean Air Fund, referring to the idea that developing countries could industrialize with renewable energy and skip over development that rich nations historically made with fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cIt's baffling why development assistance is being given to something that continues to make people unhealthy as well as harms the planet,\u201d she added.",
      "For example, an arm of the World Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development loaned $105 million toward rehabilitating coal plants in India, with their last loans toward the project going out in 2018, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "However, the improvements made coal plants more efficient and reduced their greenhouse gas emissions, according to project documents.",
      "The Clean Air Fund's report estimated the World Bank provided $2.7 billion in \u201cfossil fuel prolonging finance\u201d between 2018 and 2022. During that time, the bank also loaned about 32 times the amount for renewables.",
      "\"Renewable energy support is always our first choice as we work to provide access to electricity,\" a World Bank spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The bank's policies still \u201cselectively support natural gas as a transition fuel\u201d if its research shows the project is low risk to the climate, the spokesperson said. The bank's recent policies require vetting for every project to make sure its investments reduce climate impacts.",
      "The World Bank delivered $42.6 billion in climate finance in its most recent fiscal year, a 10% increase from the year before. And at the most recent COP, the bank promised nearly half of its lending will soon go toward climate finance.",
      "In Vietnam, about half of power generation comes from fossil fuels, primarily coal power. The Asian Development Bank loaned about $900 million on coal in Vietnam, with their spending on the fossil fuel in the country ending in 2017. The bank's updated climate policies \u201cwill not support coal mining, processing, storage, and transportation, nor any new coal-fired power generation,\u201d it said in a statement. The bank put $9.8 billion toward climate finance in 2023, and aims to finance $100 billion in climate-friendly projects between 2019 and 2030.",
      "The country\u2019s biggest growth area for energy is in wind. The Global Energy Monitor ranks Vietnam seventh in the world in planned wind power. And the Asian Development Bank committed about $60 million in loans toward wind energy in Vietnam between 2021 and 2022.",
      "The banks have made broad commitments in recent years to align with the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. But those promises leave pathways open to continue funding fossil fuels, said Bronwen Tucker, global public finance co-manager at Oil Change International.",
      "According to the group's monitoring of the banks' commitments, all nine of the major banks tracked can fund gas projects in at least some cases.",
      "\u201cThe MDBs can't be climate bankers if they are still fossil bankers,\" she said. \u201cRelying on banks that are locking in fossil fuels and the worst-ever debt crisis is not working.\u201d",

      "\u201cVetrepreneurs\u201d \u2013 veterans that start small businesses or startups -- own nearly 2 million small businesses that employ 5.5 million people in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration. They take in about $1.3 trillion in revenue annually. Their numbers have shrunk, however, as the veteran population has aged. In a 2023 report, the SBA found veteran ownership declined from 11% of businesses in 2014 to 8.1% in 2020.",
      "Veterans enter the business world prepared with skills they gain in the field like leadership and problem-solving. But they haven\u2019t had a chance to build up credit or savings that civilians have had more time to do. That can cause problems because banks use that information to approve loans. Not to mention the mental toll it takes to transition from the military life to civilian life.",
      "According to data from business coaching nonprofit SCORE, about a third of veteran businesses have limited access to capital or lack of financing. That compares to a quarter of non-veteran-owned firms.",
      "SCORE CEO Bridget Weston says the good news is that veterans have plenty of places to turn to for help. Those include nonprofit organizations aimed at getting them on their feet and building up financial literacy, veteran-only loans and grants, and contracts earmarked for veteran owned and disabled veteran owned small businesses.",
      "The place that many start is the Small Business Administration, which offers a program to get certified as a veteran-owned or disabled veteran-owned small business, which can make it easier to get certain loans and federal contracts.",
      "That\u2019s the route Jackson Dalton decided to take when he started Black Box Safety, a maker of personal protective equipment, in 2017. Dalton enlisted in the U.S. Marines in 2000 and was selected for the prestigious Marine Corps Special Operations. But a badly broken leg, suffered during training, eventually forced him medically retire after two years of active duty.",
      "Although the transition back to civilian life was difficult, Dalton went on to get a master\u2019s degree in public health, and spent 10 years working in the health and safety industry. When he ventured out on his own, he decided to focus on federal contracts and got certified by the SBA. He thought prisons would be a good place to start since 3% of their contracts go to disabled veteran businesses. His first contract was selling gloves to a prison in Minnesota. Today, he serves major clients like the Department of Veterans Affairs and the State of California.",
      "Dalton credits his military training with his success.",
      "\u201cThe skills and attributes that I picked up in the military were resilience and grit and the ability to adapt, improvise, overcome when you know, when encountering resistance or obstacles and barriers,\u201d he said.",

The business donates part of its revenue to charities supporting Texas children in foster care and awaiting adoption. Similar nonprofits include Bunker Labs, Tactical Launch, and others around the country.",
      "\u201cAnybody who wants to start a business, especially a veteran, go find a group like a Warrior Rising, there are all kinds of different groups like that getting mentorship,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who are doing what you do. They\u2019re doing what I do, and they love it and they want to talk about it.\"",
      "For some, a veteran-earmarked loan can be what makes or breaks a business. Elizabeth Gore, the co-founder and President of Hello Alice, a financial technology firm that works with small businesses on getting funding, including 117,000 military small business owners. \u201cThey have to really struggle more than other groups and demographics on access to capital,\u201d she said.",
      "John Griveas in Buffalo, N.Y. spent two years as a Navy Seal in the mid-1990s and his remaining four years in New York in the active reserves, ending his tenure in 2002. After that he \u201cbounced around\u201d different jobs and spent 10 years in the local collections industry.",

      "California farmers have been devoting more land to pistachios, which are seen as hardier and more drought-tolerant in a state prone to dramatic swings in precipitation",
      "LOST HILLS, Calif. -- In a sprawling plant in the heart of California's farmland, millions of shells rush down a metallic chute and onto a conveyor belt where they are inspected, roasted, packaged and shipped off to groceries around the world.",
      "Pistachios are growing fast in California, where farmers have been devoting more land to a crop seen as hardier and more drought-tolerant in a state prone to dramatic swings in precipitation. The crop generated nearly $3 billion last year in California and in the past decade the United States has surpassed Iran to become the world\u2019s top exporter of the nut.",
      "\u201cThere has been an explosion over the last 10 or 15 years of plantings, and those trees are coming online,\u201d said Zachary Fraser, president and chief executive of American Pistachio Growers, which represents more than 800 farmers in the southwestern U.S. \u201cYou are starting to see the fruit of people\u2019s vision from 40 years ago.\u201d",
      "California grows more than a third of the country's vegetables and three quarters of its fruit and nuts, according to state agricultural statistics. Pistachios have surged over the past decade to become the state's sixth-biggest agricultural commodity in value ahead of longtime crops such as strawberries and tomatoes, the data shows.",
      "Much of the crop is headed to China, where it is a popular treat during Lunar New Year. But industry experts said Americans also are eating more pistachios, which were rarely in grocery stores a generation ago and today are a snack food found almost everywhere. They are sold with shells or without and flavors range from salt and pepper to honey roasted.",
      "The Wonderful Co., a $6 billion agricultural company known for brands such as Halo mandarins and FIJI Water, is the biggest name in pistachios. The company has grown pistachios since the 1980s, but it ramped up in 2015 after developing a rootstock that yields as much as 40% more nuts with the same soil and water, said Rob Yraceburu, president of Wonderful Orchards.",
      "Now, Wonderful grows between 15% and 20% of the U.S. pistachio crop, he said. Its pistachio orchards stretch across vast tracts of dust-filled farmland northwest of Los Angeles also lined with pomegranates and dairies. The trees are shaken each fall and the nuts hauled to a massive processing facility to be be prepped for sale.",
      "\"There is an increasingly growing demand in pistachios,\" Yraceburu said. \u201cThe world wants more.\u201d",
      "Pistachios are poised to weather California's dry spells better than its even bigger nut crop, almonds, which generated nearly $4 billion in the state last year, industry experts said.",
      "Pistachio orchards can be sustained with minimal water during drought, unlike almonds and other more sensitive crops. The trees also rely on wind instead of bees for pollination and can produce nuts for decades longer, Yraceburu said.",
      "Many California farmers who grow both nuts are applying lessons learned from almonds to the pistachio boom. Almond production, which is much bigger than pistachio, also soared in California, but prices fell amid a glut of post-pandemic supply while farmers grappled with drought and rising input costs, leading some to not replant aging orchards when it came time to take them out.",
      "Pistachio growers say they hope to avoid a similar fate and are striving to keep demand for the nut ahead of supply. For example, American Pistachio Growers recently inked an endorsement deal with a top cricket player in India hoping to help promote pistachios there, Fraser said.",
      "The rise of pistachios is part of California farmers' shift into perennial crops commanding higher returns than products such as cotton, according to a 2023 report by the Public Policy Institute of California.",
      "Perennial crops, which are not replanted annually, can't just be swapped out during dry years, which can be challenging during extensive drought, said Brad Franklin, a research fellow at the institute's Water Policy Center.",
      "But pistachios have benefits other perennial crops don't. They can go longer without water and grow in saline soils. That may make them appealing to California farmers who are facing limits on how much groundwater they can pump under a state law aimed at conserving the critical resource, he said.",
      "When farmers decide what to plant, \u201cI think the biggest thing is the market and where is the market,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cAnd water is right below that.\u201d",
      "Farmers across California are bracing for the impact of the 2014 state law aimed at ensuring a more sustainable use of groundwater after years of over pumping depleted basins and eroded water quality in some rural areas. About a fifth of California's pistachio crop is grown in areas that rely exclusively on groundwater for irrigation, Yraceburu said, adding he expects some of these orchards will eventually come out of production.",
      "But over the next few years, pistachio acreage is expected to continue to grow in the state as trees planted in recent years come into production. That is in contrast to almond and walnut acreage, which are stabilizing or declining as orchards are being pulled out, said David Maga\u00f1a, a senior analyst at Rabobank in Fresno, California.",
      "Pistachios require about 3 acre-feet (3,700 cubic meters) of water per acre (0.4 hectares) compared with nearly 4 acre-feet (4,934 cubic meters) for almonds and produce more per acre than almonds while fetching a higher price, he said.",
      "\u201cYou see all the value the pistachio industry is providing to California agriculture is approaching that of almonds with a lot less acreage,\u201d Maga\u00f1a said. \u201cI haven't seen pistachio orchards being pulled out.\u201d"

That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been able to do what I\u2019ve done for 12 healthy seasons, going on 13. Very blessed.\"",

Warriors fans have laughed, cried, cheered and celebrated alongside him, and it\u2019s only fitting that they get a chance to show their love and salute him in his return to the Bay.\u201d",

      "Dallas Cowboys receiver CeeDee Lamb is throwing shade at his home field after losing a ball in the sun on a potential touchdown catch",
      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- CeeDee Lamb was unhappy about losing a ball in the sun on an incompletion that helped keep Dallas from scoring a go-ahead touchdown in the first half of a 34-6 loss to Philadelphia on Sunday.",
      "Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones was perturbed that the sun was brought up again as an issue in his $1.2 billion retractable roof stadium, which has glass doors on either end.",
      "AT&T Stadium has an unusual east-west alignment from end zone to end zone, as opposed to most venues being north-south. On clear days, the sun shines in the windows on the west side during the first half of games that kick off in the afternoon.",
      "Lamb, Dallas' All-Pro receiver, was looking into the sun in the second quarter while open on a crossing route in the end zone when a throw from Cooper Rush went behind him and he never adjusted to the ball.",
      "Lamb then pointed to his eyes and was making similar gestures on the sideline during another frustrating home loss for the Cowboys (3-6), who are on a four-game losing streak overall and 0-4 at AT&T Stadium.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t see the ball. Couldn\u2019t see the ball, at all. The sun,\u201d said Lamb, who ended a preseason-long holdout by signing a $136 million, four-year contract extension in late August.",
      "Asked whether the Cowboys should put up curtains, Lamb said: \u201cYes. One thousand percent.\u201d",
      "And on the question of making the suggestion to Jones, Lamb said, \u201cI mean, y\u2019all are doing my job for me right now.\u201d",
      "It has been suggested plenty of times, and Jones always has flatly rejected it. The 82-year-old billionaire angrilyrebuffed it after bringing up the issue unprompted in his postgame session with reporters.",
      "\u201cBy the way, we know where the sun is going to be when we flip the coin, so we do know where the damn sun is going to be in our own stadium,\u201d Jones said. \u201cLet\u2019s just tear the damn stadium down and build another one. Are you kidding me?\u201d",
      "While Jones' response could be taken as a criticism of embattled coach Mike McCarthy, Jones said it wasn't.",
      "\u201cEvery team that comes in here has the same issues,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey know where the sun is going to be. Every team has the same thing. I'm not saying (it\u2019s on McCarthy). I\u2019m saying the world knows where the sun is. We get to know that almost a year in advance. So someone asked me about the sun. What about the sun? Where\u2019s the moon? We\u2019re fine. But everybody plays in the sun out here.\u201d",
      "The Cowboys are bracing for official word that quarterback Dak Prescott needs season-ending surgery for a torn hamstring. They have lost five in a row at AT&T Stadium, with five turnovers in each of the past two losses.",
      "The curtains, or lack thereof, just add to the angst. The next time they will be an issue is Thanksgiving Day against the New York Giants.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t win games turning the ball over five times,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI don\u2019t give a (expletive) who lines up. So that\u2019s the part we got to get right.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "There is no such a thing as a perfect season, according to Roger Penske, even after winning his third consecutive NASCAR Cup Series championship",
      "AVONDALE, Ariz. -- There is no such a thing as a perfect season. At least that is what Roger Penske told The Associated Press hours after winning his third consecutive NASCAR championship.",
      "Maybe not.",
      "But Team Penske sure came close.",
      "It started in January with a rare show of emotion from \u201cThe Captain\u201d \u2014 Josef Newgarden said his 87-year-old boss was in tears \u2014 after Team Penske won its first Rolex 24 at Daytona endurance race since 1969.",
      "Weeks later, Joey Logano put a Penske car on the pole for the Daytona 500 for the first time in team history. It turned out Logano was wearing an illegal glove for that historic qualifying run \u2014 a trick Penske lit into his veteran leader for even trying \u2014 but the organization moved on to win nearly everything else in major motorsports this season.",
      "Will Power came up short in the IndyCar championship to three-time champion Alex Palou, and Team Penske didn't win the 24 Hours of Le Mans, but shy of that? Most major trophies say Penske this year.",
      "The IndyCar team \u2014 rocked by its own cheating scandal in the season-opening race \u2014 won six races and Newgarden claimed a second consecutive Indianapolis 500 victory. Scott McLaughlin finished third in the final standings.",
      "The sports car program that Penske has built from scratch with partner Porsche last month won the IMSA championship and two weekends ago in Bahrain won the World Endurance Championship. At the same time in Martinsville, Virginia, reigning NASCAR champion Ryan Blaney won the race to put two Penske cars in Sunday's winner-take-all Cup Series championship at Phoenix Raceway.",
      "A 50% chance is pretty decent odds for any team owner, but Penske was armed with 2022 champion Logano, defending champion Blaney and a shot at winning three straight Cup titles. The organization delivered, with Logano earning his third championship in a closing laps battle with Blaney that gave Penske its first 1-2 NASCAR points finish in team history.",
      "Team Penske is also the only team to win the Cup championship since NASCAR introduced its new car in 2022, and the organization is the first since Hendrick Motorsports in 1998 to win three-straight titles with multiple drivers.",
      "Longtime sponsor Shell-Pennzoil was on the car for both Newgarden's Indy 500 win and Logano's championship Sunday, and, as far as Penske is concerned, this season ranks among the best for an organization that began in 1968.",
      "\u201cWell, I guess you\u2019d have to say it\u2019s probably, if not the best, one of the best,\u201d Penske said. \u201cI think that obviously not to win the IndyCar championship, which of course it\u2019s where we all started and built our first racing team, was disappointing.\u201d",
      "And there it is, the part about nothing ever being perfect. Penske can still find a shortfall in this otherwise impeccable season that saw the organization win its 100th Cup Series race with Ford; a 20th Indianapolis 500 win; a second career sweep of front row qualifying at Indy; the 100th sports car win and 100th sports car pole for the organization; Logano becoming just the 10th driver in NASCAR history to win three or more titles, and crew chief Paul Wolfe, with 41 victories, now the winningest active team leader in the Cup Series.",
      "It is all the people who have made this a banner season, Penske insisted. His name is on the cars, but it is the long-term employees who make the organization so successful.",
      "\u201cRacing is a common thread through our company. It\u2019s our brand, and of course we want to win,\u201d Penske said. \u201cWhat I try to do is provide them with what they need to be champions. We\u2019re not always up like this. Sure, we want to win more. We want to win properly.\u201d",
      "He listed the key personnel of his race teams, all Penske-grown and not plucked away from another team \u2014 a key factor in both loyalty and commitment to the \u201cPenske Perfect\u201d cause.",
      "\u201cThey have that domain knowledge, which makes it so important, and they work as one team,\u201d Penske said. \"So what I need to do is continue to push them because we\u2019re not interested in sitting here and not having the success. We talk about the 24 Hours of Daytona, that rubbed off on these guys.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re always asking me how are we doing?\" Penske continued. \"And I think when you think about it, the number of people that we have that we touch every race in our company, and we have 74,000 people that (Monday) are going to be just climbing the walls with happiness because of the success \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019m in it for.\u201d",
      "Logano, in the glow of his latest championship, quoted his father to explain what it is like to work for Penske: \u201cYou can\u2019t soar like an eagle if you\u2019re working with a bunch of turkeys,\u201d he said of Tom Logano's mantra.",
      "\u201cYou think about what Team Penske is today, racing in all the different forms of motorsports and winning in all of them, like where else do you want to go? This is where you go to win. You surround yourself with a winner, that\u2019s what happens,\u201d Logano said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of eagles there. There\u2019s a lot of really smart people, a lot of driven individuals, and that goes through so many different forms throughout Penske.\u201d",

      "John Robinson has died at 89",
      "LOS ANGELES -- John Robinson, the veteran football coach who enjoyed many years of success at the University of Southern California and with the Los Angeles Rams, has died. He was 89.",
      "The Rams confirmed Robinson's death on Monday. He died in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, of complications from pneumonia, USC said in a release.",
      "Robinson is high on the short list of football coaches who enjoyed significant success in both the college and pro ranks. He went 104-35-4 at USC and 75-68 with the Rams, winning postseason games and contending for championships regularly with both teams. Robinson was particularly successful in bowl games, going 8-1 in the postseason with USC and UNLV.",
      "\u201cCoach Robinson was one of the greatest college coaches ever, and his love for USC and his love for the game of football was second to none,\u201d said Ronnie Lott, an All-American safety under Robinson at USC. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that while playing for him, he gave us the ability to feel like we were larger than life. And his commitment to making sure that we had more than just football in our lives was so superior.\"",
      "Robinson was a member of the College Football Hall of Fame for his two successful tenures at USC. He also became the winningest coach in Rams history during his nine-year tenure with the NFL club. Sean McVay passed Robinson's career victories total only last month.",
      "Robinson coached at USC from 1976 to 1982 and again from 1993 to 1997. He never had a losing record at the school, and his Trojans won five conference titles and four Rose Bowls. Running backs Charles White (1979) and Marcus Allen (1981) won the Heisman Trophy while playing in Robinson's relentless rushing offenses.",
      "\u201cCoach Robinson was very demanding, but in a human way,\u201d said Paul McDonald, the quarterback of Robinson's superbly talented 1979 team at USC. \u201cHe had great interpersonal skills, and he knew how to connect with people. He made you want to play hard for him and to run through walls. You cared for him because he cared so much for you.\u201d",
      "Robinson moved to the Rams in 1983 and reached the playoffs in six of his first seven seasons, winning four playoff games and advancing to two NFC championship games.",
      "The Rams observed a moment of silence for Robinson at SoFi Stadium on Monday night before they faced the Miami Dolphins.",
      "Robinson spent six seasons coaching UNLV after his second USC tenure, also serving a stint as the Rebels' athletic director. He was most recently a senior consultant at LSU from 2019 to 2021 during the tenure of head coach Ed Orgeron.",
      "Robinson was born July 25, 1935, in Chicago, and he grew up in the Bay Area, attending prep school with close friend John Madden and graduating from high school in 1954. He played tight end on Oregon's 1958 Rose Bowl championship team before beginning his coaching career with the Ducks.",
      "Robinson became John McKay's offensive coordinator at USC in 1972, coaching the unbeaten 1972 consensus national championship team and the 1974 team that went 10-1-1. Robinson left the Trojans for one year to join Madden with the Oakland Raiders, but returned to USC in 1976 when McKay took over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",
      "Robinson coached USC to seven outstanding seasons, winning the Pac-8 or Pac-10 titles and the Rose Bowl in three of his first four years in charge. His 1978 team was named national champions by the UPI coaches' poll, while Bear Bryant's Alabama won the AP title. He coached a long list of stars during his tenure, from White and Allen to Pro Football Hall of Famers Lott, Anthony Mu\u00f1oz and Bruce Matthews.",
      "Robinson kept winning in 1983 when he moved to the Rams, who played their home games in Anaheim, California. With an offense led by Eric Dickerson, Robinson's teams racked up six playoff appearances and lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions in two conference title games.",
      "Robinson's second tenure at USC included a fourth Rose Bowl victory, but the school dismissed him following the 1997 season.",
      "Robinson then coached UNLV from 1999-2004, taking over a program that had lost 16 games in a row. He got the Rebels to only the third bowl appearance in school history in just his second season, but Robinson stepped away after the 2004 season with a 28-42 record at the school. One of his more notable victories was a 23-5 win at No. 14 Wisconsin in 2003.",
      "\u201cFootball lost a legend today,\u201d UNLV director of athletics Erick Harper said. \u201cCoach Robinson was revered by his players, peers, fans and co-workers. He led a wonderful life on and off the football field at so many places, including here at UNLV as both a coach and administrator. Our thoughts and prayers go out to John\u2019s family as we remember all that he did for the sport nationally and right here in Las Vegas.\u201d",
      "Robinson spent many years between his coaching jobs in broadcasting on television and radio. He returned to football five years ago at LSU as a consultant to Orgeron, the former USC coach.",
      "Robinson is survived by his wife, Beverly, his four children, two stepchildren and 10 grandchildren.",
      "A celebration of Robinson\u2019s life will be held following the college football season, in accordance with his wishes.",

      "\u201cI think they know who I am and, again, they\u2019re mature,\" Golden said. \u201cThey\u2019re all really good guys and all super focused. We had really good practices. We had a great shoot-around and I thought they were all really locked in. I felt like we were going to play really well.\"",

      "The Cardinals' sideline froze. The home fans gasped in horror.",
      "Then, Murray got to his feet \u2014 a little smirk flashing across his face \u2014 and kept on playing some of the best football of his life.",
      "Arizona won its fourth straight game by racing to a big lead and easily handling the New York Jets in a 31-6 victory Sunday. Murray threw for 266 yards and a touchdown and also ran for two scores in another stellar performance, picking apart a Jets defense that was ranked No. 2 against the pass this season.",
      "\u201cThe quarterback was the best player on the planet today,\u201d Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon said.",
      "The Cardinals (6-4) scored touchdowns on four of their first five drives and never trailed.",
      "Murray completed 22 of 24 passes \u2014 including a franchise-record 17 in a row during one stretch \u2014 spreading the ball around to James Conner, Trey McBride, Marvin Harrison Jr. and Michael Wilson. The Cardinals quarterback also ran for 21 yards.",
      "\u201cI just try to keep it as simple as possible,\" Murray said. \u201cThe guys, they made plays for me all day. It's great to go out there and feel the way we did today. No matter what they did, we had a good day offensively.\u201d",
      "Conner had five catches for 80 yards. Harrison caught the sixth touchdown pass of his rookie season. The Cardinals' defense didn't allow a touchdown for the third straight home game.",
      "New York (3-7) has lost six of its last seven, failing to build off the momentum of last week's win over the Texans. Aaron Rodgers completed 22 of 35 passes for 151 yards. Breece Hall ran for 52 yards.",

It was well executed, a bunch of guys are making plays, and I thought our mode of play was on display. We'll grade the tape hard, but there's not going to be a lot of loafs, but our guys are humming.\u201d",
      "Arizona iced its win on the ensuing drive, with Murray tip-toeing through the Jets\u2019 defense for a spectacular 12-yard run and a 31-6 lead. It capped an efficient 10-play, 88-yard drive.",

      "Murray ran for a 1-yard touchdown for a 14-3 lead with 2:54 left in the first quarter.",
      "Murray\u2019s third TD drive was arguably his most impressive. The quarterback got drilled by Williams on a first-and-10 play at the Jets 22, but never seemed fazed, grabbing his helmet and getting right back into the huddle.",
      "\u201cI was standing up one moment,\u201d said Murray, who admitted it was one of the hardest hits he's taken in his career. \u201cAnd on the ground the next moment.\u201d",
      "Laughing off the frightening play, he made a crucial third-down throw to McBride and then found Harrison on a fade route in the end zone for a 9-yard touchdown, making it 21-6 midway through the second quarter.",
      "New York had to settle for two field goals in the first half. Spencer Shrader connected from 25 and 45 yards in his Jets debut.",

    "story": [
      "For the first time, a group of U.S. researchers has concluded that China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor to power future aircraft carriers",
      "BANGKOK -- China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press.",
      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \"blue-water\u201d force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States.",
      "\u201cNuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\u201d said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \u201cFor China\u2019s leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country\u2019s global image as a leading power.\u201d",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",
      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",
      "Neither China\u2019s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\u201cThe reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\u201d",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen\u2019s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles (112 kilometers) southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship\u201d under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \u201cnational defense-related construction project\u201d that is classified \u201csecret.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\u201d researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \u201cconvincing argument.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\u201d she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \u201ccarefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\u201d",
      "\u201cGiven the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\u201d said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \u201cski-jump\u201d type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \u201csoon be announced,\u201d but so far it has not been.",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \u201cincremental improvements.\u201d",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \u201chave taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\u201d",
      "Eventually, however, \u201clarger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\u201d Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\u201cAs well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\u201d Childs said.",
      "\u201cMuch will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\u201d",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \u201cwith greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\u201d said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\u201cThese carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\u201d Zhao said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \u201cfirst-class\u201d navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \u201cspeeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\u201d",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",
      "And China's \u201cgrowing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China\u2019s shore,\u201d the report said.",

      "Nuclear carriers take longer to build than conventional carriers, but once in operation they are able to stay at sea for much longer because they do not need to refuel, and there is more room on board for fuel and weapons for aircraft, thus extending their capabilities. They are also able to produce more power to run advanced systems.",

      "NEW YORK -- As money continues to pour into crypto following Donald Trump's victory last week, bitcoin has climbed to yet another record high.",
      "The world's largest cryptocurrency topped $87,000 for the first time on Monday. As of around 3:45 p.m. ET, bitcoin's price stood at $87,083, per CoinDesk, up over 28% in the last week alone.",
      "That's part of a rally across cryptocurrencies and crypto-related investments since Trump won the U.S. presidential election last week. Analysts credit much of the recent gains to an anticipated \u201ccrypto-friendly\u201d nature of the incoming administration, which could translate into more regulatory clarity but also leeway.",
      "Still, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is hard to predict. And while some are bullish, others continue to warn of investment risks.",
      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now, but has come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, and reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "A lot of it has to do with the outcome of last week's election.",
      "Trump was previously a crypto skeptic, but changed his mind and embraced cryptocurrencies during this year's presidential race. He has pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for. And Trump had previously promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "\u201cCrypto rallied as Election Day progressed into the night and as it became increasingly clear that Trump would emerge victorious,\u201d Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a Friday research note, pointing to larger industry sentiment around Trump being \u201ccrypto-friendly\" and a potential shift in regulatory backing.",
      "Even before the post-election rally, assets like bitcoin posted notable gains over the past year or so. Much of the credit goes to early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\u201d Glass and Saunders noted. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Crypto assets like bitcoin have a history of drastic swings in value \u2014 which can come suddenly and happen over the weekend or overnight in trading that continues at all hours, every day.",
      "In short, history shows you can lose money as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. Then came the 2022 collapse of FTX, which significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall.",
      "At the start of last year, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000. Investors, however, began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. While some crypto supporters see the potential for more record-breaking days, experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "\u201cInvestors should only dabble in crypto with money that they can be prepared to lose,\u201d Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said last week. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve seen these wild swings in the past.\u201d",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \u201cmining,\" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth\u2019s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin\u2019s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",
      "In the U.S., the Energy Information Administration notes that crypto mining across the country has \u201cgrown very rapidly over the last several years,\" adding that grid planners have begun to express concern over increases in related electricity demand. Preliminary estimates released by the EIA in February suggest that annual electricity use from crypto mining probably represents between 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.",
      "Environmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections from regulators around the world.",

Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia.

      "The explosions in mid-September were widely blamed on Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. The blasts killed at least 37 people, including two children, wounded more than 3,000 and deeply unsettled even Lebanese who have no Hezbollah affiliation.",

      "Bayram said the casualty count was even higher than first reported, saying \u201cmore than 4,000 civilians fell \u2014 between martyrs and injured and maimed \u2014 in a few minutes by this attack.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis method of warfare and conflicts may open the way for many who are evading international humanitarian law to adopt this method of warfare,\u201d the minister told reporters at the U.N. compound in Geneva.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous precedent, if not condemned,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in a situation where ordinary objects -- objects used in daily life -- become dangerous and lethal.\u201d",

      "The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would set an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would institute an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing harm to our kids and I\u2019m calling time on it,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced in Parliament during its final two weeks in session this year, which begin on Nov. 18. The age limit would take effect 12 months after the law is passed, Albanese told reporters.",
      "The platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would need to use that year to work out how to exclude Australian children younger than 16.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The proposal comes as governments around the world are wrestling with how to supervise young people's use of technologies like smartphones and social media.",
      "Social media platforms would be penalized for breaching the age limit, but under-age children and their parents would not.",
      "\u201cThe onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. The onus won\u2019t be on parents or young people,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "Antigone Davis, head of safety at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the company would respect any age limitations the government wants to introduce.",
      "\u201cHowever, what\u2019s missing is a deeper discussion on how we implement protections, otherwise we risk making ourselves feel better, like we have taken action, but teens and parents will not find themselves in a better place,\u201d Davis said in a statement.",
      "She added that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. TikTok declined to comment.",
      "The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, described the age limit as a \u201c20th Century response to 21st Century challenges.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement.",
      "More than 140 Australian and international academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Jackie Hallan, a director at the youth mental health service ReachOut, opposed the ban. She said 73% of young people across Australia accessing mental health support did so through social media.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble,\u201d Hallan said.",
      "Child psychologist Philip Tam said a minimum age of 12 or 13 would have been more enforceable.",
      "\u201cMy real fear honestly is that the problem of social media will simply be driven underground,\u201d Tam said.",
      "Australian National University lawyer Associate Prof. Faith Gordon feared separating children from there platforms could create pressures within families.",
      "Albanese said there would be exclusions and exemptions in circumstances such as a need to continue access to educational services.",
      "But parental consent would not entitle a child under 16 to access social media.",
      "Earlier this year, the government began a trial of age-restriciton technologies. Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, the online watchdog that will police compliance, will use the results of that trial to provide platforms with guidance on what reasonable steps they can take.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said the year-long lead-in would ensure the age limit could be implemented in a \u201cvery practical way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere does need to be enhanced penalties to ensure compliance,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "\u201cEvery company that operates in Australia, whether domiciled here or otherwise, is expected and must comply with Australian law or face the consequences,\u201d she added.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support for an age limit at 16.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Paul Fletcher said the platforms already had the technology to enforce such an age ban.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really a technical viability question, it\u2019s a question of their readiness to do it and will they incur the cost to do it,\u201d Fletcher told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThe platforms say: \u2019It's all too hard, we can\u2019t do it, Australia will become a backwater, it won\u2019t possibly work.' But if you have well-drafted legislation and you stick to your guns, you can get the outcomes,\u201d Fletcher added."

    "story": [
      "As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan\u2019s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour.",
      "As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan.",
      "Perhaps the biggest consequence for China \u2014 if Trump stays true to his campaign promises \u2014 is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "Tariffs like that would be a blow to China\u2019s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China\u2019s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS.",
      "During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised.",
      "President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles.",
      "Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade.",
      "\u201cGiven the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.\u201d",
      "Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump\u2019s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he\u2019ll be able to do quickly, without saying how.",
      "Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.",
      "\u201cChina is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,\" Wang wrote in a recent commentary. \"These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.\u201d",
      "There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs \u2014 150% to 200% \u2014 on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.",
      "Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\u2019s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979.",
      "Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing.",
      "China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.",
      "\u201cWill (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,\u201d he said.",
      "As for China\u2019s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi \u201crespects me and he knows I\u2019m (expletive) crazy.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. weapons this year.",
      "In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said.",
      "Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe are clear about the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence.",
      "But Trump has criticized Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world\u2019s supply of the most advanced chips.",
      "The island\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center.",
      "Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago.",
      "\u201cRather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan\u2019s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan\u2019s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,\u201d Goto said."

      "\u201cThey are not infected with any disease whatsoever. They are harmless and a little skittish,\u201d Yemassee Police Chief Gregory Alexander said Thursday morning.",
      "The Rhesus macaque primates escaped from the Alpha Genesis facility Wednesday when a new employee didn't fully shut an enclosure, Alexander said.",
      "The monkeys are females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms) and are so young and small that they haven't been used for testing, police said.",
      "Alpha Genesis employees \u201ccurrently have eyes on the primates and are working to entice them with food,\u201d police said in a statement issued around noon Thursday.",
      "The company usually handles escapes on site, but the monkeys got outside the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee, Alexander said.",
      "\u201cThe handlers know them well and usually can get them back with fruit or a little treat,\u201d Alexander told The Associated Press by phone.",
      "But rounding up these escapees is taking some more work. Alpha Genesis is taking the lead, setting up traps and using thermal imaging cameras to recapture the monkeys on the run, the chief said.",
      "\u201cThere is almost no danger to the public,\u201d Alexander said.",
      "People living nearby need to shut their windows and doors so the monkeys can't find a place to hide inside and if they see the primates, call 911 so company officials and police can capture them.",

      "Australia\u2019s states and territories have unanimously backed a world-first national plan to ban children younger than 16 from most forms of social media",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s states and territories on Friday unanimously backed a national plan to require most forms of social media to bar children younger than 16.",
      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",
      "The minor Greens party was critical, saying the ban would prevent the emergence in Australia of future child environmental activists like Sweden's Greta Thunberg.",
      "More than 140 academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Critics say most teenagers are tech savvy enough to get around such laws. Some fear the ban will create conflicts within families and drive social media problems underground.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, argues that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "The government likens the proposed social media age limit to the laws that restrict the sale of alcohol to adults aged 18 and older across Australia. Children still find ways to drink, but the prohibition remains.",
      "\u201cWe think these laws will make a real positive difference,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "But Lisa Given, professor of information sciences at RMIT University, described the legislation as \u201creally problematic.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of our social networks are actually about the provision of extremely critical information to kids,\u201d Given told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re also facing bullying and other challenges online, but they actually need the social supports to know how to navigate the platforms safely and so they need more support from parents, from care-givers, not less access to a single or multiple platforms,\u201d Given added.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, described the government\u2019s plan to remove 14 and 15-year-olds from their already established social media accounts was \u201cstrange.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve already developed that space in that world, to have it taken away really could do as much harm as the harms that are purportedly being fixed,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThere are so many questions about this that have yet to be answered, but even if we had solid answers about how this might work technically and how this might get implemented socially, it's still hard to believe that this would actually keep kids safe online,\" he added.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said children would retain access to online education and health services.",
      "The legislation would also include strong privacy protections surrounding age verification.",
      "\u201cPrivacy must be paramount, including that of children,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cWe should also be very clear about the realities. These platforms know about their users in a way that no one else does.\u201d",
      "Rowland said YouTube would likely be included among the mainstream platforms defined under the legislation as age restricted services.",
      "But YouTube Kids could be exempted. Gaming and messaging services would not face age restrictions, she said,",
      "\u201cThis legislation would strike a balance between minimizing the harms experienced by young people during a critical period of their development while also supporting their access to benefits as well,\u201d Rowland said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Shares of Tesla soared Wednesday as investors bet that the electric vehicle maker and its CEO Elon Musk will benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House.",
      "Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump\u2019s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.",
      "\u201cTesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, in a note to investors. \u201cThis dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players.\u201d",
      "Tesla shares jumped 14.8% Wednesday while shares of rival electric vehicle makers tumbled. Nio, based in Shanghai, fell 5.3%. Shares of electric truck maker Rivian dropped 8.3% and Lucid Group fell 5.3%.",
      "Tesla dominates sales of electric vehicles in the U.S, with 48.9% in market share through the middle of 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Subsidies for clean energy are part of the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022. It included tax credits for manufacturing, along with tax credits for consumers of electric vehicles.",
      "Musk was one of Trump\u2019s biggest donors, spending at least $119 million mobilizing Trump\u2019s supporters to back the Republican nominee. He also pledged to give away $1 million a day to voters signing a petition for his political action committee.",
      "In some ways, it has been a rocky year for Tesla, with sales and profit declining through the first half of the year. Profit did rise 17.3% in the third quarter.",
      "The U.S. opened an investigation into the company\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system after reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one that killed a pedestrian. The investigation covers roughly 2.4 million Teslas from the 2016 through 2024 model years.",
      "And investors sent company shares tumbling last month after Tesla unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi at a Hollywood studio Thursday night, seeing not much progress at Tesla on autonomous vehicles while other companies have been making notable progress.",
      "Tesla began selling the software, which is called \u201cFull Self-Driving,\u201d nine years ago. But there are doubts about its reliability.",

    "summary": "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
    "story": [
      "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Joe Biden's administration on Friday proposed tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles (17,000 square kilometers) of federal land in the U.S. West to protect a declining bird species.",
      "However, it is doubtful the changes would survive under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Greater sage grouse \u2014 chicken-sized birds known for an elaborate mating ritual\u2014 were once found across much of the U.S. West. Their numbers plummeted in recent decades because of energy exploration, wildfires, disease and other pressures.",
      "A 2015 agreement shepherded by the Obama administration kept the birds off the endangered species list, by imposing limits on where and when development could occur across 226,000 square miles (590,000 square kilometers) of remaining grouse habitat spanning 11 states.",
      "Now, in the closing weeks of the Biden administration, officials with the Interior Department want to make the protections even stronger. Their plan would eliminate loopholes that allowed development in areas considered crucial to the bird's long-term survival. New solar and wind projects would be excluded, and oil and gas exploration could only occur from drilling sites located outside the protected areas.",
      "Trump has pushed to open more public lands to energy development in line with his mantra to \u201cdrill baby drill.\u201d During his first administration, officials attempted to scale back the Obama-era sage grouse protections, but were blocked in court.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday's science-based proposal would boost sage grouse while allowing development on government lands to continue.",
      "\u201cFor too long, a false choice has been presented for land management that aims to pit development against conservation,\u201d Haaland said in a statement.",
      "Yet the agency's attempt to find a middle ground fell flat with the oil and renewable energy industries, Republicans and even some environmentalists.",
      "A spokesperson for American Clean Power, a renewables industry lobbying group companies, said it had supported an earlier version of the proposal but not the final details released Friday. Spokesperson Phil Sgro said the proposal \u201cunnecessarily restricts the development of wind, solar, battery storage and transmission, undermining the ability to deploy much needed clean energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Most of the land at issue is in Nevada and California, according to government documents. Affected parcels also are in Wyoming, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Montana and the Dakotas.",
      "In Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon said the proposal would add new layers of federal regulation and hinder practical solutions for the grouse. U.S. Sen. John Barrasso accused the Biden administration of trying to ram though the changes on its way out the door.",
      "\u201cI look forward to working with the Trump-Vance administration to reverse this reckless decision,\u201d said Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee.",
      "Several major conservation organizations, including the Nature Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation and Natural Resources Defense Council, issued a joint statement in support of the changes.",
      "Other environmentalists said officials had squandered a chance to put in place more meaningful protections that could halt the grouse's slow spiral towards extinction. They noted that loopholes allowing development would remain in place across nearly 50,000 square miles (122,000 square kilometers) of sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cIt's death by a thousands cuts,\u201d said Greta Anderson with Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group involved in previous sage grouse lawsuits. \u201cThe Biden administration could have stopped the cutting, and it didn't.\u201d",
      "Federal officials predicted minimal economic impacts. They said energy companies already steer clear of sage grouse habitat, where there are limits on when and where work can be done near breeding areas. Those companies can still find opportunities on other public lands, the officials said.",
      "That was disputed by Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance. She said the Biden administration already had limited leasing in sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cSo they\u2019ve denied access and then say companies are avoiding them anyway,\u201d Sgamma said. \u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management will accept protests against Friday's proposal until Dec. 9. Final decisions on changes to the agency's land management plans will be made after the protests are resolved.",
      "A related proposal to help sage grouse would block for 20 years new mining projects on more than 15,625 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. That proposal was part of the 2015 Obama-era protections. It was canceled under Trump then restored by a court.",
      "An analysis of the mining ban will be published by the end of the year, according to the Interior Department.",
      "Greater sage grouse once numbered in the millions across all or portions of 11 Western states. Populations have dropped 65% since 1986, according to government scientists."

      "Authorities say 43 monkeys bred for medical research that escaped a compound in South Carolina have been spotted in the woods near a fence surrounding the site and that workers are using food to try to recapture them",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Forty-three monkeys bred for medical research that escaped a compound in South Carolina have been spotted in the woods near the site and workers are using food to try to recapture them, authorities said Friday.",
      "The Rhesus macaques made a break for it Wednesday after an employee at the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee didn't fully lock a door as she fed and checked on them, officials said.",
      "\u201cThey are very social monkeys and they travel in groups, so when the first couple go out the door the others tend to just follow right along,\u201d Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard told CBS News.",
      "Westergaard said his main goal is to have the monkeys returned safely with no other problems. \u201cI think they are having an adventure,\u201d he said.",
      "The monkeys on Friday were exploring the outer fence of the Alpha Genesis compound and are cooing at the monkeys inside, police said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe primates are exhibiting calm and playful behavior, which is a positive indication,\u201d the police statement said, adding company workers are closely watching the monkeys while keeping their distance as they work to safely recapture them.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police all said the monkeys pose no risk to public health. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical and other researchers.",
      "\u201cThey are not infected with any disease whatsoever. They are harmless and a little skittish,\u201d Yemassee Police Chief Gregory Alexander said Thursday.",
      "Authorities still recommend that people who live near the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee shut their windows and doors and call 911 if they see the monkeys. Approaching them could make them more skittish and harder to capture, officials said.",
      "Eve Cooper, a biology professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who has studied rhesus macaques, said the animals have the potential to be dangerous and urged people to keep their distance.",
      "Rhesus macaques monkeys can be aggressive. And some carry the herpes B virus, which can be fatal to humans, Cooper said.",
      "However, Alpha Genesis states on its website that it specializes in pathogen-free primates. Cooper noted that there are pathogen-free populations of rhesus macaques that have been quarantined and tested.",
      "\u201cI would give them a wide berth,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThey\u2019re unpredictable animals. And they can behave quite aggressively when they\u2019re afraid.\u201d",
      "Alpha Genesis provides primates for research worldwide at its compound about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia, according to its website.",
      "Locally, it is known as \u201cthe monkey farm.\u201d And there is more amusement than panic around Yemassee and its population of about 1,100 just off Interstate 95 about 2 miles from Auldbrass Plantation, a Frank Lloyd Wright house designed in the 1930s.",
      "There have been escapes before, but the monkeys haven't caused problems, said William McCoy, who owns Lowcountry Horology, a clock and watch repair shop.",
      "\u201cThey normally come home because that\u2019s where the food is,\" he said.",
      "McCoy has lived in Yemassee for about two years and while he plans to stay away from the monkeys, he has his own light-hearted plan to get them back.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m stocking up bananas, maybe they\u2019ll show up,\" McCoy said.",
      "The Alpha Genesis compound is regularly inspected by federal officials.",
      "In 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined Alpha Genesis $12,600 in part after officials said 26 primates escaped from the Yemassee facility in 2014 and an additional 19 got out in 2016.",
      "The company's fine was also issued because of individual monkey escapes as well as the killing of one monkey by others when it was placed in the wrong social group, according to a report from the USDA.",
      "The group Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent a letter Thursday to the USDA asking the agency to immediately send an inspector to the Alpha Genesis facility, conduct a thorough investigation and treat them as a repeated violator. The group was involved in the 2018 fine against the company.",
      "\u201cThe clear carelessness which allowed these 40 monkeys to escape endangered not only the safety of the animals, but also put the residents of South Carolina at risk,\u201d wrote Michael Budkie, executive director of the group.",
      "The USDA, which has inspected the compound 10 times since 2020, didn't immediately respond to the letter.",
      "The facility's most recent federal inspection in May showed there were about 6,700 primates on site and no issues.",
      "In a 2022 review, federal veterinarians reported two animals died when their fingers were trapped in structures and they were exposed to harsh weather. They also found cages weren't adequately secure. Inspectors said criminal charges, civil penalties or other sanctions could follow if the problems weren't fixed.",
      "Since then, Alpha Genesis has undergone six inspections with minor problems reported only once.",
      "In January 2023, the USDA said temperatures were out of the 45 to 85 degree Fahrenheit (7.2 to 29.5 degree Celsius) required range at some of the compound's monkey cages. The inspection found moldy food in one bin, sharp edges on a gate that could cut an animal and sludge, food waste, used medical supplies, mechanical equipment, and general construction debris on the grounds.",
      "Supporters of medical research involving nonhuman primates said they are critical to lifesaving medical advances like creating vaccines against COVID-19 because of their similarities to people. Keeping a domestic supply of the animals is critical to prevent shortages for U.S. researchers.",
      "Humans have been using the rhesus macaque for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe that rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "These monkeys have been launched into space on V2 rockets, used for AIDS research, had their genome mapped and made stars of their own reality television show. They were in such high demand in the early 2000s that a shortage led to scientists paying up to $10,000 per animal.",
      "Outside of rats and mice, rhesus macaques are one of the most studied animals on the planet, said Dario Maestripieri, a behavioral scientist at the University of Chicago who wrote the 2007 book \u201cMacachiavellian Intelligence: How Rhesus Macaques and Humans Have Conquered the World.\u201d",
      "The animals are very family oriented, siding with relatives when fights break out. And they\u2019re adept at building political alliances in the face of threats from other monkeys. But they can be painful to watch. Monkeys with lower status in the hierarchy live in a constant state of fear and intimidation, Maestripieri said.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, they kind of represent some of the worst aspects of human nature,\u201d Maestripieri said.",

      "Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed.",
      "The first sample alone is not enough and additional small-scale sampling missions will be necessary in order to obtain more data, TEPCO spokesperson Kenichi Takahara told reporters Thursday. \u201cIt may take time, but we will steadily tackle decommissioning,\u201d Takahara said.",
      "Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the. plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery.",
      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit.",
      "That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",
      "On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said.",
      "Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out.",
      "On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment.",
      "The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel.",
      "Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive melted fuel remains in them.",
      "The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target to finish the cleanup by 2051, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. Some say it would take for a century or longer.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said there have been some delays but \u201cthere will be no impact on the entire decommissioning process.\u201d",
      "No specific plans for the full removal of the fuel debris or its final disposal have been decided."

      "WASHINGTON -- Racist text messages invoking slavery raised alarm across the country this week after they were sent to Black men, women and students, including middle schoolers, prompting inquiries by the FBI and other agencies.",
      "The messages, sent anonymously, were reported in several states, including New York, Alabama, California, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. They generally used a similar tone but varied in wording.",
      "Some instructed the recipient to show up at an address at a particular time \u201cwith your belongings,\u201d while others didn't include a location. Some of them mentioned the incoming presidential administration.",
      "It wasn't yet clear who was behind the messages and there was no comprehensive list of where they were sent, but high school and college students were among the recipients.",
      "The FBI said it was in touch with the Justice Department on the messages, and the Federal Communications Commission said it was investigating the texts \u201calongside federal and state law enforcement.\u201d The Ohio Attorney General's office also said it was looking into the matter.",
      "Tasha Dunham of Lodi, California, said her 16-year-old daughter showed her one of the messages Wednesday evening before her basketball practice.",
      "The text not only used her daughter's name, but it directed her to report to a \u201cplantation\u201d in North Carolina, where Dunham said they\u2019ve never lived. When they looked up the address, it was the location of a museum.",
      "\u201cIt was very disturbing,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s just trying to figure out what does this all mean for me? So, I definitely had a lot of fear and concern.\u201d",
      "Her daughter initially thought it was a prank, but emotions are high following Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. Dunham and her family thought it could be more nefarious and reported it to local law enforcement.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t in slavery. My mother wasn't in slavery. But we\u2019re a couple of generations away. So, when you think about how brutal and awful slavery was for our people, it\u2019s awful and concerning,\u201d Dunham said.",
      "About six middle school students in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, received the messages too, said Megan Shafer, acting superintendent of the Lower Merion School District.",
      "\u201cThe racist nature of these text messages is extremely disturbing, made even more so by the fact that children have been targeted,\u201d she wrote in a letter to parents.",
      "Students at some major universities, including Clemson in South Carolina and the University of Alabama, said they received the messages. The Clemson Police Department said in a statement that it had been notified of the \u201cdeplorable racially motivated text and email messages\u201d and encouraged anyone who received one to report it.",
      "Fisk University, a historically Black university in Nashville, Tennessee, issued a statement calling the messages that targeted some of its students \u201cdeeply unsettling.\u201d It urged calm and assured students that the texts likely were from bots or malicious actors with \u201cno real intentions or credibility.\u201d",
      "Missouri NAACP President Nimrod Chapel said Black students who are members of the organization's Missouri State University chapter received texts citing Trump\u2019s win and calling them out by name as being \u201cselected to pick cotton\u201d next Tuesday. Chapel said police in the southeastern Missouri city of Springfield, home of the university, have been notified.",
      "\u201cIt points to a well-organized and resourced group that has decided to target Americans on our home soil based on the color of our skin,\u201d Chapel said in a statement.",
      "Nick Ludlum, a senior vice president for the wireless industry trade group CTIA, said: \u201cWireless providers are aware of these threatening spam messages and are aggressively working to block them and the numbers that they are coming from.\u201d",
      "David Brody, director of the Digital Justice Initiative at The Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that they aren\u2019t sure who is behind the messages but estimated they had been sent to more than 10 states, including most Southern states, Maryland, Oklahoma and even the District of Columbia. The district's Metropolitan Police force said in a statement that its intelligence unit was investigating the origins of the message.",
      "Brody said a number of civil rights laws can be applied to hate-related incidents. The leaders of several other civil rights organizations condemned the messages, including Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center, who said, \u201cHate speech has no place in the South or our nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe threat \u2014 and the mention of slavery in 2024 \u2014 is not only deeply disturbing, but perpetuates a legacy of evil that dates back to before the Jim Crow era, and now seeks to prevent Black Americans from enjoying the same freedom to pursue life, liberty, and happiness,\u201d said NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson. \u201cThese actions are not normal.

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Three NASA astronauts whose prolonged space station mission ended with a trip to the hospital last month declined to say Friday which one of them was sick.",
      "Astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps publicly discussed their spaceflight for the first time since returning from the International Space Station on Oct. 25. They spent nearly eight months in orbit, longer than expected because of all the trouble with Boeing\u2019s Starliner crew capsule and rough weather, including Hurricane Milton.",

      "\u201cSpaceflight is still something we don\u2019t fully understand. We\u2019re finding things that we don\u2019t expect sometimes. This was one of those times and we\u2019re still piecing things together on this,\" said Barratt, the only member of the crew who had flown in space before.",
      "Epps said everyone is different in how they respond to space -- and gravity.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 14:50:29 -0500",
    "summary": "The assets of Alex Jones' Infowars are set to be auctioned off next week, and both supporters and detractors of the conspiracy theorist are expressing interest in bidding",
    "story": [
      "The assets of Alex Jones' Infowars are set to be auctioned off next week, and both supporters and detractors of the conspiracy theorist are expressing interest in bidding",
      "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars broadcasts could end next week as he faces a court-ordered auction of his company's assets to help pay the more than $1 billion defamation judgment he owes families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Or maybe not.",
      "Both opponents and supporters of the bombastic internet show and radio host have expressed interest in bidding on the Infowars properties he has built over the past 25 years. They include Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and Donald Trump, and anti-Jones progressive media groups. If Jones supporters buy the assets, he could end up staying on Infowars.",
      "Up for sale are everything from Jones' studio desk to Infowars' name, video archive, social media accounts and product trademarks. Buyers can even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. For now, Jones' personal social media, including his account on X, formerly known as Twitter, with 3 million followers, are not up for sale, but court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "The auctions resulted from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after the Sandy Hook families were awarded nearly $1.5 billion in damages in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas over his claims that the school shooting was a hoax. Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets also are being liquidated to help pay the judgment.",
      "The deadline to submit bids and nondisclosure agreements on the Infowars assets is Friday afternoon. After the bids are reviewed, prospective buyers deemed qualified will be invited to a live auction that could see multiple bidding rounds next Wednesday. Any items not sold will be put up at another auction on Dec. 10.",
      "Jones has expressed confidence that supporters \u2014 whom he did not name \u2014 will buy the assets of Infowars and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, allowing him to continue using its platforms. He also appears to be preparing for losing the brand because he has set up new websites and social media accounts and has been directing his audience to them.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buyers, people that are patriots that want it and will come in,\u201d Jones said on his show in August. \u201cIf not ... we'll work with somebody else, fire something up. And it\u2019ll be a little bit of a hiccup for the crew, and things. But that will just make us bigger.\u201d",
      "Email messages to Infowars and Jones' bankruptcy lawyer were not returned.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much money the auctions might bring in. In court documents, Free Speech Systems listed the total value of its properties and holdings at $18 million. Proceeds from the sales will go to creditors including the Sandy Hook families, who have not yet received any money from Jones and his company.",
      "Confidentiality agreements and sealed bids generally are used in auctions to maximize bid amounts while preventing bidders from talking to each other and driving down the offers. The trustee in Jones' bankruptcy case said in court documents that the procedures for the Infowars auction were designed to attract the highest possible bids.",
      "Christopher Mattei, a Connecticut lawyer representing the Sandy Hook families, called the auctions an important milestone in their yearslong fight to hold Jones accountable. He also said the families will be seeking a portion of all Jones' future income.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, the Connecticut families have sought to hold Jones fully accountable for his lies and to protect other families from him,\u201d Mattei said. \u201cStripping Jones of the corrupt business he used to attack the families while poisoning the minds of his listeners is an important measure of justice.\u201d",
      "The families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 hoax conspiracies and threats by his followers.",
      "Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the judgments.",
      "Jones has made millions of dollars from his internet and radio shows, primarily through sales of nutritional supplements, survival gear, clothing and other merchandise.",
      "Jones and other right-wing commentators once on the fringe have catapulted in popularity as many people have moved away from traditional news sources. Trump elevated them further during his 2024 campaign by repeating some of their conspiracy theories and appearing on several of their podcasts and shows. On Thursday, Jones, a long-time Trump supporter, even accepted proposals, some perhaps tongue-in-cheek, by Donald Trump Jr. and other conservatives to be the president-elect's press secretary.",
      "Stone, the Jones and Trump ally and a conservative commentator, said on his X account and on Jones' show that he would like to put together a group of investors to buy Infowars. He did not return email and social media messages on Thursday.",
      "\u201cI understand the importance of Infowars as a beacon of the truth, as a beacon of truthful information. And therefore, I would like to do whatever I possibly can to ensure, if possible, that Infowars survives,\" Stone said on Jones' show in September.",
      "People on social media also have urged billionaire Elon Musk, owner of Tesla and X, to buy Infowars, an idea Jones has backed but Musk has not publicly responded to.",
      "On the other side, Jones' detractors have shown interest in buying Infowars, kicking Jones out and turning it into something else, such as a news site that debunks conspiracy theories or even a parody site. They include officials at two progressive media sites, The Barbed Wire and Media Matters for America.",
      "An opinion piece by The Barbed Wire in September by publisher Jeff Rotkoff had a headline that read, \"Let\u2019s Buy Infowars. Alex Jones used these exact materials to exploit his viewers, peddle conspiracy theories, and damage the lives of grieving parents. We want revenge.\u201d",
      "Rotkoff urged readers to donate money to help put in bids, but he said Thursday that The Barbed Wire, based in Jones' home state of Texas, was now unlikely to make any offers.",
      "\u201cBut we have talked to a number of similarly ideologically aligned bidders and we are certain we will be outbid,\u201d Rotkoff said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that there appear to be multiple well-resourced bidders who share our interest in undoing much of the damage to our country done by Alex Jones. We\u2019ll be rooting for those folks to be successful.\u201d",
      "He declined to say who the other potential bidders were.",
      "Who exactly has submitted bids so far has not been disclosed. Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, which is helping to run the auction along with Tranzon Asset Advisors, would only say there have been a large number of inquiries.",
      "If detractors buy up Infowars' properties and Jones gets the boot, he should be able to build new platforms fairly quickly, said Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor of communication and media at Merrimack College in Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cAs long as there is an audience hungry for his content \u2014 and there is \u2014 he\u2019ll be able to utilize X and various fringe social media platforms,\" she said in an email."

    "title": "Recess appointments could short-circuit Senate opposition to Trump nominees: ANALYSIS",
    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:23:07 -0500",
    "summary": "The use of recess appointments to install members of Donald Trump's Cabinet would circumvent a key Senate process, consolidating presidential power.",
    "story": [
      "Installing Cabinet picks without Senate vote can be constitutional, experts say",
      "By urging the incoming GOP Senate majority to embrace recess appointments to install members of his Cabinet, Republican President-elect Donald Trump is in effect asking his party to unilaterally surrender a major constitutional responsibility and key check on presidential power.",
      "Article II of the Constitution gives a president authority to make appointments \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,\" which typically must hold hearings on a candidate and take a vote to confirm. Installing members of the Cabinet or executive branch when the Senate is out of session bypasses those steps.",
      "The fact that recess appointments have emerged as an early litmus test in the race for Senate GOP leader could be an indication that at least some of Trump's expected nominees will be highly controversial and potentially unconfirmable.",
      "During Trump's first term, members of his own party openly opposed some of his appointments, forcing the nominations to be withdrawn and reissued.",
      "While many Republicans in the past have protested recess appointments as a brazenly political end run around the Senate, the practice is neither unprecedented nor unconstitutional.",
      "Bill Clinton made 139 recess appointments while in the White House; George W. Bush made 171; and Barack Obama made 32, according to the Congressional Research Service. In most of those cases, the Senate was controlled by the opposite party.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in a 2014 decision, NLRB v. Noel Canning, gave the executive branch broad leeway to fill executive branch vacancies when the Senate is not in session, even for political purposes such as difficulty securing Senate confirmation.",
      "The court laid out guidelines for the process in Canning, noting that the Senate is in recess \"when it says it is\" and that the Constitution requires the recess to last 10 days or more for a president to be able to fill an open seat.",
      "One significant wrinkle is that a vote of the House is also necessary to approve an adjournment of 10 days or more. The Constitution's Adjournment's Clause says neither chamber should be out of session \"for more than three days\" without consent of the other.",
      "Any of Trump's appointees successfully installed during a recess would have the same legal authority and pay as a Senate-confirmed appointee. That said, a recess appointment is temporary -- expiring at the end of the Senate's \"next session\" (effectively almost two years).",
      "There's no bar on successive recess appointments of the same or a different person to a particular position, though it remains a contested legal question whether an individual installed twice during recess could continue to be paid, according to CRS.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump has tapped former Rep. Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "In a statement on Monday, Trump praised Zeldin's background as a lawyer and said he's known the former New York congressman for a long time.",
      "\"He will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet,\" Trump said. \"He will set new standards on environmental review and maintenance, that will allow the United States to grow in a healthy and well-structured way.\"",
      "Zeldin confirmed he had been offered the job in a social media post.",
      "\"It is an honor to join President Trump's Cabinet as EPA Administrator,\" Zeldin wrote on X. \"We will restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI. We will do so while protecting access to clean air and water.\"",
      "Zeldin represented Long Island's Suffolk County in the House of Representatives for eight years. He ran for governor against Democrat Kathy Hochul in 2022, earning Trump's endorsement but falling short of Hochul by 6 points.",
      "Zeldin previously criticized the Biden-Harris administration for canceling a key permit needed for the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline and rejoining the Paris climate agreement after Trump withdrew. During his gubernatorial bid, he wanted to reverse New York state's ban on hydraulic fracking.",
      "Zeldin will need to be confirmed by the Senate to lead the EPA.",
      "Shortly after Trump's announcement, Zeldin appeared on Fox News' \"The Story\" and stressed his role within the agency would be to carry out Trump's plan to \"unleash economic prosperity through the EPA.\"",
      "He pledged to quickly eliminate regulations upon his arrival at the EPA, claiming existing rules are hampering businesses across the country.",
      "\"So day one and the first 100 days, we have the opportunity to roll back regulations that are forcing businesses to be able to struggle,\" Zeldin said. \"They're forced to cut costs internally, they are moving overseas altogether to be able to bolster liquidity in the American economy, where businesses strive to grow, expand here and have the ability to export what they produce, as opposed to exporting their jobs in the company -- the companies themselves.\"",
      "While vowing to cut regulations, Zeldin still insisted that Trump cares about \"conserving the environment\" and providing access to clean air and water.",
      "Trump's pick of Zeldin comes less than a week after Election Day and as Trump's new administration begins to take shape.",

    "summary": "President-elect Trump plans to nominate GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida for secretary of state, according to sources.",
    "story": [
      "The one-time Trump rival is positioned to become the top U.S. diplomat",
      "President-elect Donald Trump is expected to announce his intention to nominate Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., for secretary of state, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.",
      "Rubio, 53, has served in the Senate since 2011. He is currently the vice-chair of the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Intelligence and also sits on the chamber's Committee on Foreign Relations.",
      "Several long-serving State Department officials tell ABC News they respect Rubio's extensive foreign policy experience and view him as unlikely to overly politicize the secretary of state role.",
      "Rubio was also said to be favored for the role by Trump's chief of staff and veteran Florida political operative Susie Wiles, potentially helping the lawmaker edge out loyalists from the first Trump administration like former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and former National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien.",
      "In an interview following Trump's election victory, Rubio told CNN that the U.S. was entering \"an era of pragmatic foreign policy.\"",
      "\"The world is rapidly changing. You know, adversaries are uniting -- in North Korea, Iran, China, Russia -- increasing coordinating,\" Rubio said. \"It is going to require us to be very pragmatic and wise in how we invest overseas and what we do.\"",
      "Rubio has consistently held many hawkish and traditionally Republican positions on international concerns, including Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but has bent to align with Trump\u2019s agenda -- including his skeptical view of sustained support for Kyiv\u2019s war effort.",
      "While Rubio was initially a leading advocate for Ukraine, he voted against a supplemental funding bill passed in April that allocated about $61 billion dollars for the country, explaining at the time that he rejected the legislation because he did not believe it adequately addressed immigration concerns.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on Russia\u2019s side -- but unfortunately the reality of it is that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated settlement,\u201d Rubio said during an interview in late September.",
      "\u201cAnd I want, and we want, and, I believe Donald Trump wants, for Ukraine to have more leverage in that negotiation,\u201d he added.",
      "Because of Rubio's stature in the Senate and long tenure in Washington, his Senate confirmation process is broadly expected to run smoothly.",
      "Rubio's appointment is not anticipated to create problems for Republicans in the Senate. Florida law authorizes the state's governor, Republican Ron DeSantis, to fill the empty seat by appointment until the next scheduled general election, when Floridians would vote for candidates to serve out the remainder of Rubio's term.",
      "Republicans see Trump's double-digit win over Vice President Kamala Harris in Florida, the highest margin of victory for a presidential candidate in the state for 36 years, as a sign that the former battleground is now a firmly cemented as a GOP stronghold.",
      "Rubio has also dramatically shifted toward the president-elect in recent years, transforming from a rival Trump once dubbed \"Lil Marco\" to a contender for a top Cabinet post in his second administration",
      "During the 2016 presidential election, Rubio ran against Trump for the Republican nomination -- slamming him as a \"con artist\" on the campaign trail before dropping out after losing to Trump in the Florida primary.",
      "Rubio eventually endorsed Trump's bid for the White House and was widely supportive of his policies during his first term, during which Rubio served as an unofficial adviser on strategy for Latin America and was described by the New York Times as a \"virtual secretary of state\" for the administration.",
      "In 2024, Rubio again endorsed Trump for president and was on the shortlist of potential running mates before Trump ultimately selected Ohio Senator JD Vance.",

      "To do so, the former president said he would use local law enforcement and the National Guard to find migrants living across the U.S.",
      "Homan said his main priority will be overseeing and formulating Trump's long-vowed mass deportation strategy while consolidating decisions related to border security.",
      "\"Everybody talks about this mass deportation operation. President Trump talks about. I'll oversee that and come up with a strategy for that,\" Homan said during a lengthy interview with his hometown television station WWNY on Monday.",
      "Homan said Trump's mass deportations is \"going to be a targeted enforcement operation, concentrating on criminals and national security threats first.\"",
      "He acknowledged that the deportations would be costly but argued the policy would \"save the taxpayers a lot of money.\"",
      "Homan said he does not plan to \"separate women and children\" but acknowledged that deporting alleged criminals would result in breaking up families.",
      "\"When we arrest parents here, guess what? We separate them. The illegal aliens should be no different,\" Homan said.",

      "Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman from New York's 21st District, was elected last week to her sixth term in the House. Born in 1984, she was at the time of her 2014 election the youngest woman to ever win a seat in Congress.",
      "She joined House leadership in May 2021, when she was elected as chair of the House Republican Conference. She replaced former Rep. Liz Cheney in the role after Cheney was denounced by her party for her criticism of Trump in the wake of Jan. 6.",
      "Stefanik came to Congress as a relatively moderate Republican and skipped the 2016 Republican National Convention when Trump first became the party's presidential nominee.",
      "But she became one of Trump's most vocal allies, denouncing his first impeachment in 2019 and later challenging the 2020 election results.",

    "story": [
      "Trump won't vote in the secret-ballot race, but his influence on it is palpable.",
      "Senate Republicans are poised to make a historic decision on Wednesday when they'll gather behind closed doors to select their new party leader -- and President-elect Donald Trump's influence in undeniable as he insists that whoever be selected support his ability to install recess appointments to his Cabinet.",
      "With Trump's victory and Senate Republican's majority secured, the lead up to the race has intensified the jockeying between the three major contenders for the position: Sen. John Thune, Sen. John Cornyn and Sen. Rick Scott.",
      "The leadership election, slated to occur just one day after the Senate returns from its monthlong election recess, will see Senate Republicans selecting their first new leader since 2007, when current Republican Leader Mitch McConnell first won the job. McConnell is the longest-serving party leader in United States history, but announced earlier this year he'd be stepping aside after the election.",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican who currently serves as the No. 2 Republican, is somewhat of a front-runner in the race. He has served as the party whip for the last six years and in that time has notched a number of policy wins for the party, and has been working behind closed doors to whip support for the role for months. Thune said he keeps in regular contact with Trump and his team, but the two have at times had an icy relationship.",
      "Running against Thune is Cornyn, a Texas Republican and another established GOP leader who served as the party's whip for the six years prior to Thune before being term-limited out of the role. Though Cornyn has a slightly more conservative track record than Thune, he also faced ire from Trump for his support of the bipartisan gun safety bill that passed in the wake of the shooting in Uvalde, Texas.",
      "Also vying for the role is Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican who just won reelection. Scott has attempted to brand himself as the most Trump-aligned of the contenders, but is less popular among some of his Senate colleagues after a stint atop the Senate GOP's campaign arm in 2022 led to a less-than-successful night for Senate Republicans.",
      "Trump won't get a vote in this secret-ballot race, but his influence over it is palpable.",
      "Many Republicans see Trump's comfortable victory in Tuesday's elections coupled with Senate Republicans' new majority as a sweeping mandate to implement Trump's policies, and as such, potential party leaders seem to be cozying up to Trump ahead of the vote.",
      "Trump has not yet endorsed a specific candidate for the race, and it's unclear whether he ultimately will. Instead, Trump has attempted to exert influence over the race by arguing that whoever is slated to fill the role supports a modification to what has become the Senate's normal operating procedure to allow him to temporarily install appointments to federal vacancies without Senate approval during the Senate recesses.",
      "\"Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner. Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more. This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again. We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\" Trump wrote on his social media platform on Sunday.",
      "Recess appointments are permitted by the constitution, and allow presidents to fill federal vacancies during Senate recesses. Though once a regular occurrence, the Senate has operated in such a way as to block all recess appointments since former President Barack Obama's first term. Allowing recess appointments for Trump's second term could allow controversial nominees who may otherwise fail to get the support they need from the GOP-controlled Senate to serve for nearly two years without Senate approval.",
      "None of the top contenders have ruled out supporting the use of these recess appointments, and their responses to Trump's post show how far each is willing to go to show that they're on Trump's side.",
      "Though Thune said in an interview on Thursday that his \"preference\" would be for Trump to stay out of the Senate leadership race, he issued a statement Sunday night following Trump's post affirming his commitment to installing Trump's Cabinet, and not ruling out the appointments Trump is seeking.",
      "\"One thing is clear: We must act quickly and decisively to get the president's cabinet and other nominees in place as soon as possible to start delivering on the mandate we've been sent to execute, and all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments,\" Thune said in a statement. \"We cannot let Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats block the will of the American people.\"",
      "Cornyn meanwhile discussed the use of recess appointments with Trump prior to his post, per a source familiar. In a post on X Sunday afternoon, Cornyn affirmed his support, noting that if he is elected leader, he will keep the Senate in session continuously until nominees are confirmed.",
      "\"It is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump's cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent. Additionally, the Constitution expressly confers the power on the President to make recess appointments,\" Cornyn wrote.",
      "Almost immediately after Trump posted on Sunday, Scott posted on X that he was in lockstep with Trump on this policy.",
      "\"100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible,\" Scott wrote, reposting Trump's post.",
      "A small handful of senators have come out publicly to endorse their chosen candidate.",
      "Scott, for his part, has picked up endorsements from some of Trump's most out-and-proud supporters in the Senate as well as a number of Trump-aligned outside voices, including Robert F. Kennedy and Elon Musk.",
      "But this critical race has a very small constituency: only Republican senators serving in the incoming Senate get a vote. ABC News has not yet reported a projection in the Pennsylvania Senate race, but that means only about 52 people will get to cast ballots.",
      "Senators are also shielded behind closed doors and by secret ballot in this race. In order to win the election, a candidate must amass a simple majority of the vote. If all candidates fail to get a simple majority, the lowest vote earner is eliminated from the process, and senators vote again.",
      "Because of the secret nature of the vote, it's unclear how much of an influence any outside factor, including Trump, will ultimately wield.",

      "Sen. JD Vance, who is now the vice president-elect, is also eligible to cast a vote in the election if he so chooses, but his team has not yet said whether he ultimately will attend Wednesday's vote.",
      "In addition to the closely-watched race for party leader, a number of other positions will also be selected during Wednesday's vote. Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, is running unopposed to becoming the No. 2 Senate Republican. Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, and Sen. Tom Cotton, the Republican from Arkansas, are in a race to become the conference chair. Additional down-ballot races will also be voted on Wednesday.",

      "Trump's granddaughter shared her election night experience on YouTube.",
      "Kai Trump, President-elect Donald Trump's 17-year-old granddaughter, released an \"Election Night Vlog\" on her YouTube channel Monday afternoon, where she took viewers behind the scenes into her family's experience awaiting results on election night.",
      "\"I'm ready to party it up tonight, and hopefully we can catch a dub,\" Kai Trump said, tapping into Gen-Z slang.",
      "She provided an inside look into the viral family photo taken in Mar-a-Lago on election night, with footage featuring Trump talking about \"dark MAGA\" hats and insisting on including surrogate Elon Musk in the shot.",
      "\"Elon? You have to have a picture with your boy,\" Trump said. \"You have to get Elon with his boy. Gorgeous, perfect boy.\"",
      "Early in the evening, the family was seated around four TV screens displaying ABC News, Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC newscasts as they eagerly awaited for results to filter in. Trump could be briefly seen sitting silently facing the TV screens.",
      "\"He's up right now 20 Electoral College votes, so I think that's pretty solid,\" Kai said, describing the newscast results at the moment.",
      "Providing a more casual, lighthearted glimpse into night, Kai also recorded herself getting her hair and makeup done, picking out her outfit, and taking selfies with family members.",
      "Additional shots featured Kai driving to Mar-a-Lago and the Palm Beach County Convention Center, cracking jokes with a friend about Nutella, and singing along to \"Money, Money, Money\" from the \"Mamma Mia\" soundtrack -- what she said was her go-to song whenever she pulls into Mar-a-Lago. The crowd could also be seen emulating Trump's signature dance moves.",
      "In addition to these lighter moments, Kai also opened up about the emotional aspect of the night, particularly in terms of her nerves.",
      "\"The past five days, I have been so nervous, like I feel like I've had butterflies in my stomach for so long,\" she said, in addition to later expressing her anxieties by \"stress-eating\" sweet treats. Later in the video, she explains how she began \"tearing up\" when Pennsylvania was called for Trump.",
      "Towards the end of the vlog, Kai announced that they were headed to say hello to Vice President-elect JD Vance, though the footage did not feature him. Melania Trump was also not seen or mentioned in the video.",
      "While Kai did not record Trump's ultimate victory or the celebratory events/reactions following the results, she later filmed a one-on-one explaining her admiration of her grandfather.",
      "\"I just finished playing 18 holes with him. It was his first time playing in probably 90 days or more,\" she said, before recapping the sentimental value of Election Night. \"It's his last time running, so it was so special for him to win,\" she said.",
      "The oldest daughter of Donald Trump Jr., Kai recently stepped into the public eye after delivering a speech at the Republican National Convention in July in which she described Trump as a \"normal grandpa\" who is \"very caring and loving.\"",
      "Kai's YouTube channel, which has 133k subscribers, consists of additional vlogs featuring her golf skills and other behind-the-scenes glimpses into her life. She is also active on TikTok with 934.7k followers.",

      "\u201cIronic isn\u2019t it? The man in charge of enforcing laws can now just break them,\u201d Sotomayor claimed in her dramatic dissent in the case Trump v. U.S. in July.",
      "Republican control of Congress would give Trump significant leeway to advance his priorities and undertake a sweeping overhaul of American government and society.",
      "A six-justice conservative majority on the Supreme Court will potentially provide legal cover, and its decision in June to enshrine presumptive immunity for official presidential acts could well embolden Trump in ways he hadn\u2019t been before.",
      "But Trump\u2019s agenda and his personal impulses won\u2019t proceed entirely unchecked.",
      "Trump\u2019s appointments to lead executive agencies will require Senate confirmation and are not guaranteed. During his first term, several picks had to withdraw from consideration after stiff opposition from within his own party.",
      "Presidential executive orders and Trump agency regulations will have to comply with the Administrative Procedures Act, an arcane 1946 law requiring a \u201cnotice and comment period\u201d for policy changes and proof that public input was considered.",
      "\u201cWe will use all the tools at our disposal -- including aggressive litigation -- to ensure that key consumer and other regulatory protections remain intact,\u201d said Robert Weissman and Lisa Gilbert, co-presidents of Public Citizen, a progressive advocacy group that has sued Trump in the past.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, more than 246 agency regulations, guidance documents and memoranda were challenged in federal courts. The administration won 54 of the cases, a 22% success rate, according to data from the Institute for Policy Integrity at the NYU School of Law.",
      "In 192 cases, a court either ruled against the Trump agency or the agency withdrew the controversial action after being sued. Many of those losses involved a violation of the APA.",
      "The Supreme Court notably struck down Trump\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; blocked the White House effort to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census; and invalidated the initial Trump travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think people paid enough attention to the fact that Trump heeded the Court and agreed to rewrite the \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 three times so that it would pass constitutional muster,\u201d said Sarah Isgur, a former Trump Justice Department official and an ABC News legal contributor.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups have vowed to aggressively bring fresh litigation against Trump\u2019s agenda.",

      "\u201cLet there be no mistake, we intend to stand with states across our nation to defend our Constitution and uphold the rule of law,\u201d said Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, which filed more than 100 lawsuits against the first Trump administration.",

      "The expected onslaught of litigation will collide with a federal judicial system packed full of judges that Trump appointed -- more than 200 nominees in four years surpassing the total elevated by then-President Barack Obama in eight years.",
      "Trump appointed three justices to the Supreme Court bench -- justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett -- and may get a historic opportunity to nominate even more should a current justice retire or die. Such a development would consolidate conservative power on the Supreme Court for generations.",
      "\u201cWill the Supreme Court act as a meaningful check on a second Trump presidency? During the first Trump administration they were a real check,\u201d said University of Pennsylvania Law Professor Kate Shaw, an ABC News legal contributor. \u201cThat, however, was a different court. Trump has now transformed the Supreme Court, and this court is not one that is likely to act as a comparable check.\u201d",
      "As for checks on Trump\u2019s individual conduct, Chief Justice John Roberts made clear in his landmark opinion in June that no current or former president has absolute immunity from criminal or civil prosecution.",

    "story": [
      "Some abroad hope Biden's final months bring bold action to help end conflicts.",
      "LONDON -- President Joe Biden will see out his term knowing that President-elect Donald Trump -- a man he fought desperately hard to unseat in 2020 and called a \"genuine danger to American security\" -- will succeed him.",
      "Foreign policy has been central in Biden's long political career. It will likewise form a major chunk of his legacy, as will the two wars -- Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Middle East conflagration sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack -- that erupted during his term.",
      "Now less encumbered by political calculations -- for himself or for Vice President Kamala Harris -- and with only two months until Trump's second inauguration, the outgoing president may have one last window to wield the power of the Oval Office in both theaters.",
      "But with Trump looming above the outgoing Biden-Harris administration, American allies and enemies may be hesitant to engage with the outgoing administration.",
      "European nations, for example, are already shifting focus to how best to court Trump, Leslie Vinjamuri of the British Chatham House think tank told ABC News.",
      "\"All these European leaders are very quickly reaching out,\" she added. \"They're congratulating him. They want to talk with him. They want to work with him, because they understand that the stakes are extremely high and they clearly feel that by talking with him, they have an ability to influence policy and the outcome.\"",
      "\"What they don't want to do is to be seen to be making a deal with Joe Biden that undercuts whatever it is that Trump is going to do,\" Vinjamuri added.",
      "\"It's a very tricky position to be in, because if anything's visible that cuts across what he wants to do, you as a leader risk being punished.\"",
      "Those at the top of American politics know that foreign policy success can accelerate careers and define legacies. Former President Richard Nixon infamously undermined President Lyndon B. Johnson's efforts to negotiate an end to the Vietnam War during the 1968 election campaign for fear it would reduce his chances of victory.",
      "Though he has already secured his second term, Trump appears unlikely to help the Biden administration with any foreign policy \"wins\" in its closing days.",
      "\"There's a lot of uncertainty and room for maneuver -- it's highly unpredictable,\" Vinjamuri said.",
      "Russia's war on Ukraine has dominated much of Biden's presidency. He will leave office with Moscow's forces holding large parts of Ukraine and still advancing, even if slowly and at huge cost.",
      "\"I think that now Biden can be much more decisive in support of Ukraine, especially when he sees that Trump will be the next president,\" Oleksandr Merezhko -- a member of Ukraine's parliament and the chair of the body's foreign affairs committee -- told ABC News.",
      "\"Biden has his hands completely untied,\" Merezhko added. \"Now Biden is thinking about his legacy.\"",
      "\"He might even try to take some decisions which will make irreversible changes in support of Ukraine -- for example, he might lift all the restrictions on the use of the Western weapons on the territory of Russia,\" Merezhko said. \"And he might start the process of inviting Ukraine to join NATO.\"",
      "Merezkho acknowledged that progress on the NATO front might be ambitious. \"Yes, he doesn't have much time,\" he said. \"But he -- with [National Security Adviser] Jake Sullivan and [Secretary of State] Antony Blinken -- might do something creative to help Ukraine.\"",
      "It appears unlikely that Biden's final months will bring Kyiv any closer to NATO membership. Ukrainian leaders are still pushing for an invitation to join the alliance despite fierce opposition from Russia -- and hesitance among key alliance members. Allies have repeatedly said that \"Ukraine's future is in NATO,\" but even top officials in Kyiv acknowledge this cannot happen amid war with Moscow.",
      "The outgoing president may at least be able to ring fence much-needed funding for Kyiv.",
      "Matthew Savill of the Royal United Services Institute think tank in the U.K., said Biden \"might choose in his last months in office to use the remainder of the funding available for support to Ukraine under Presidential Drawdown Authority, amounting to over $5 billion.\"",
      "The Pentagon has already committed to rolling out new funding packages between now and January totaling some $9 billion. \"That is consistent with how we've been doing this in the past,\" Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told journalists last week. \"It's something that we've done on a pretty regular, almost weekly, basis.\"",
      "Biden has also reportedly already decided to allow non-combat American defense contractors to work in Ukraine to maintain and repair U.S.-provided weaponry.",
      "Yehor Cherniev -- a member of the Ukrainian parliament and the chairman of his country's delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly -- told ABC News that deeper sanctions on \"Putin's inner circle\" are on Kyiv's wish list, along with the delivery of all previously allocated aid, commitments for more, plus the end to restrictions on Western weapon use inside Russia.",
      "Trump has suggested he would quickly end Russia's invasion by threatening to cut off military aid to Kyiv unless it agrees to hand Moscow direct or indirect control of swaths of occupied territory in the south and east of the country.",
      "As such, his election has raised concerns in Ukraine of an imminent sellout.",
      "Merezhko, though, stressed the unpredictability of the president-elect. \"Trump might become even more critical of Russia to show that all suspicions about him are groundless,\" he said.",
      "\"We know that Trump loves his country and seeks to protect its interests in accordance with his vision,\" Cherniev said. \"Therefore, we are confident that the U.S. will not leave us alone with Russia, since this is not in the interests of the U.S. and the free world.\"",
      "\"However, much will depend on Putin's willingness to make concessions and compromises,\" he added. \"If the Russian dictator does not show due flexibility, I think Trump will increase his support for Ukraine.\"",
      "As to potential tensions between Trump and Biden in the coming months, Merezhko said, \"Competition between them will continue.\"",
      "\"For us, it would be better if they compete amongst themselves on who will do more for Ukraine.\"",
      "European nations, meanwhile, will be bracing for Trump while hoping to influence the president-elect's take on the war.",
      "Vinjamuri, of the Chatham House think tank, said Europeans will also be working closely with the Biden administration \"to put in place everything that they can to keep Europe and Ukraine in as good a place as possible before Jan. 20, when Trump comes in and tries to negotiate a peace deal.\"",
      "\"That means that getting Ukraine in the best position on the ground, because when you start negotiating a peace, a lot of what gets locked in is based on what land people hold,\" she said.",
      "The Biden administration's pre-election Middle East diplomatic push does not appear to have made significant breakthroughs in either Gaza or Lebanon. Fierce ground fighting and devastating Israeli airstrikes continue on both fronts, with the toll of civilian dead and displaced growing ever larger.",
      "The regional war began with Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel and saw around 250 taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel's military response in the strip has killed some 43,600 people and injured more than 102,000, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Israel's airstrike and ground campaign in Lebanon has killed more than 3,000 since Oct. 8, 2023, Lebanese health officials say.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu replaced Defense Minister Yoav Gallant -- one of his prime political rivals and an advocate for a cease-fire deal -- on the eve of the U.S. election, reinforcing his position and entrenching his government's commitment to what he has called \"total victory.\"",
      "Hafed Al-Ghwell, senior fellow and executive director of the North Africa Initiative at the SAIS Foreign Policy Institute, Johns Hopkins University, told ABC News he has little expectation of peace during Biden's final months. \"I don't think he has any incentive to do anything,\" Hafed said.",
      "\"In the case of Israel and Palestine, Biden has taken not just a political stand but an ideological one, and there is no sign that he is going to change that,\" Hafed added. \"He has called himself a Zionist, and he had ample opportunity to stop this war. Even when the United Nations proposed a resolution to end the occupation, he didn't support it.\"",
      "\"It would be really controversial for an outgoing president to make any major decisions,\" he continued.",
      "Meanwhile, Netanyahu will be confident in the new White House's backing in his suppression of Palestinian and Lebanese groups, as well as in his wider showdown with Iran.",
      "Netanyahu \"probably feels like he has a free run,\" Vinjamuri said. \"Even if Biden tried to push him, I'm not so sure he would be responsive, because he knows that Trump is now coming into office.\"",
      "Hafed suggested Netanyahu's domestic concerns, too, will be driving his policy in the coming months. \"He knows that the minute this war stops, the Israeli public won't want him around,\" he said. \"So, he will continue the war in Lebanon and probably threaten Iran, knowing he will have the full support of Trump.\"",
      "Burcu Ozcelik at RUSI said the extent of Trump's influence over Netanyahu tops \"a complex list of unknowns.\"",
      "\"Trump in recent weeks indicated that he was prepared to give Israel freer rein, provided that the war ended by the time he entered office,\" he added.",
      "Those living in the region will be left grappling with the fallout, Hafed continued. \"For the people of the Middle East, Biden's legacy is one of a bloodbath,\" he said. \"The region is bitter and battered.\"",

    "story": [
      "Authorities in South Carolina have captured a Tennessee fugitive accused of killing a man and trying to pass off the body as someone else's",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A fugitive accused of killing a man in Tennessee and trying to pass off the body as someone else's by calling 911, identifying himself as that person and saying he had fallen off a cliff while being chased by a bear has been captured in South Carolina, authorities said.",
      "In a social media post Sunday, the Columbia Police Department said Nicholas Wayne Hamlett, 45, was recognized by an employee at a hospital in the South Carolina city. Authorities confirmed his identity with a fingerprint scanner and he's in the temporary custody of the U.S. Marshals Service while awaiting extradition to Tennessee.",
      "Authorities in Monroe County, Tennessee, and elsewhere had been looking for Hamlett since last month.",
      "\u201cAfter observing Hamlett at a local hospital, a good citizen alerted the authorities and brought this manhunt to a peaceful end,\u201d Monroe County Sheriff Tommy Jones said in a social media post.",
      "The sheriff's office said last month that Hamlett called 911 on Oct. 18 claiming to have fallen off a cliff while running from a bear. Using the name Brandon Andrade, Hamlett claimed he was injured and partially in the water, authorities added.",
      "When emergency responders searched the area near a highway bridge in Tellico Plains, where the call had come from, they found the body of a man with Andrade's ID on it.",
      "However, authorities determined that the man was not Andrade, whose ID had been stolen and used multiple times. The person using Andrade's stolen identification was Hamlett, who was wanted in Alabama for a parole violation, the sheriff's office said. Andrade was alive and well, authorities confirmed.",
      "Forensics officials also determined that the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head, which isn't consistent with a high fall or a bear attack, Jones said.",
      "Hamlett likely fled his Tennessee home before police could verify his real identity, authorities said. That set off a manhunt for Hamlett, who was considered armed and dangerous. The U.S. Marshals Service had been offering a reward of up to $5,000 for help finding him.",
      "On Oct. 31, law enforcement officers searched Chapin, South Carolina, with helicopters and police dogs after getting information that Hamlett was in the area, telling residents to lock their doors on Halloween night. He was spotted near a high school in the city the next day.",
      "On Nov. 4, the Tennessee sheriff's office identified the dead man as 34-year-old Steven Douglas Lloyd, of Knoxville. It said Hamlett had befriended Lloyd, then lured him into the woods to kill him and take his identity.",
      "According to the sheriff, Lloyd's family said he was diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder and would leave home and live on the streets, but remained in touch with his family.",
      "\u201cSteven loved the outdoors and was so helpful when it came to others,\u201d Jones wrote in a Nov. 4 social media post. \u201cThe family was shocked to learn that their beloved son's life had been taken by someone that Steven trusted.\""

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:10:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Before he comes back for good on Inauguration Day, Donald Trump will return to the White House briefly at the invitation of President Joe Biden",
    "story": [
      "Before he comes back for good on Inauguration Day, Donald Trump will return to the White House briefly at the invitation of President Joe Biden",
      "WASHINGTON -- Before he comes back for good on Inauguration Day, Donald Trump will return to the White House briefly at the invitation of Democratic President Joe Biden, who had hoped to defeat his Republican predecessor a second time and reside there for four more years.",
      "That may make for an awkward encounter, especially given that, after Biden ousted Trump in 2020, Trump offered no such White House invitation to Biden. Trump even left Washington before the Jan. 20, 2021, inauguration, becoming the first president to do so since Andrew Johnson skipped the 1869 swearing-in of Ulysses S. Grant.",
      "Biden also has the unusual distinction of having beaten Trump in one cycle and run against him for about 15 months during this year\u2019s campaign. As he sought reelection, Biden constantly decried Trump as a threat to democracy and the nation\u2019s core values before leaving the race in July and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, who took on her own campaign and lost on Election Day.",
      "When the two meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday, it\u2019ll technically be the first time since 1992 that an outgoing president sits down with an incoming one he competed against in a campaign. Back then, Republican President George H.W. Bush met with Democrat and President-elect Bill Clinton about two weeks after they squared off on Election Day.",
      "Bush and Clinton talked policy before going together to the Roosevelt Room to meet with their transition staff. Clinton later called the meeting \u201cterrific\u201d and said Bush was \u201cvery helpful.\u201d",
      "Over the decades, such handoff meetings between outgoing presidents and their replacements have been by turns friendly, tense and somewhere in between.",
      "This time, Biden has vowed to ensure a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working with Trump, who is both his presidential predecessor and successor, to bring the country together. Biden\u2019s White House invitation to Trump includes his wife, the former and now incoming first lady, Melania Trump.",
      "\u201cI assured him that I\u2019d direct my entire administration to work with his team,\u201d Biden said of the call with Trump when he made the invitation. The president-elect \u201clooks forward to the meeting,\" spokesman Steven Cheung said.",
      "Jim Bendat, a historian and author of \u201cDemocracy\u2019s Big Day: The Inauguration of Our President,\u201d called face-to-face chats between outgoing and incoming presidents \u201chealthy for democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pleased to see that the Democrats have chosen to take the high road and returned to the traditions that really do make America great,\u201d Bendat said.",
      "This year's meeting won't be uncharted territory for Trump.",
      "He and then-Democratic President Barack Obama held a longer-than-scheduled 90-minute Oval Office discussion days after the 2016 election. White House chief of staff Denis McDonough also showed Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner around the West Wing.",
      "\u201cWe now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed. Because, if you succeed, then the country succeeds,\u201d Obama told Trump, despite the president-elect being fresh off a victory that dented the outgoing president\u2019s legacy.",
      "Trump appeared nervous and was unusually subdued, calling Obama \u201ca good man\u201d and the meeting \u201ca great honor.\u201d He said he had \u201cgreat respect\u201d for Obama and that they \u201cdiscussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties.\u201d",
      "\u201cI very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel,\u201d Trump said. Obama White House press secretary Josh Earnest described the meeting as \u201cat least a little less awkward than some might have expected,\u201d and he noted that the two \u201cdid not relitigate their differences in the Oval Office.\u201d",
      "In fact, that encounter went smoothly enough to reassure a few Trump critics that he might grow into the job and become more presidential in temperament and action \u2014 an assessment quickly subsumed by Trump\u2019s unique relish of bombast and political conflict once his administration began, particularly when it came to his predecessor.",
      "Only about four months later, Trump accused Obama \u2013 without evidence \u2013 of having his \u201cwires tapped\u201d in Trump Tower before the 2016 election. On social media, he blasted the former president for engaging in \u201cMcCarthyism\u201d and decrying it as \u201cNixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\u201d",
      "Obama aides now say that while the 2016 Trump-Obama meeting went well publicly, the incoming president's team ignored most of the transition process and did not have the same reverence for the White House and federal institutions that they or Republican President George W. Bush\u2019s team had.",
      "One recalled that the only question Trump counterparts asked at the time was not about the coming workload or responsibilities, but how best to find an apartment in Washington.",
      "The official transition process does not mandate that presidents invite their successors to face-to-face meetings, though it can feel that way.",
      "\u201cThe psychological transfer occurs then,\" former Vice President Walter Mondale once said.",
      "There's no record of George Washington scheduling a formal meeting with the nation's second president, John Adams, before leaving the then-capital city of New York. And Adams, after moving into the White House during his term, never invited his political rival and successor, Thomas Jefferson, over before leaving without attending Jefferson's inauguration in 1801.",
      "Still, by 1841, President Martin Van Buren hosted President-elect William Henry Harrison \u2014 who had soundly beaten him on Election Day \u2014 for dinner at the White House. He even later offered to leave the official residence early to make room for his successor after Washington's National Hotel, where Harrison had been staying, became overcrowded. Harrison instead made a brief, preinaugural trip to Virginia.",
      "More recently, Republican George W. Bush welcomed Obama to the White House in 2008 after calling the election of the nation's first Black president a \u201ctriumph of the American story.\u201d",
      "And eight years prior, Bush himself was the newcomer when he met with the outgoing Clinton, who had denied his father a second term. Their chat came just eight days after the Supreme Court resolved the disputed 2000 election, and Bush also later headed to the vice presidential residence to briefly talk with the man he defeated, Al Gore.",
      "Bush and Gore didn't say what they discussed, though vice presidential press aide Jim Kennedy described the conversation as meant to \u2033demonstrate that this is a country where we put aside our differences after a long and difficult campaign.\u2033",
      "Trump and Harris spoke by phone this past week but don't have a face-to-face meeting planned."

      "The Associated Press called the race Monday.",
      "\u201cThank you for choosing me to serve as your Mayor. As the first Hmong American woman to become the mayor of a major American City, it has been the honor of my lifetime,\u201d she said in a statement last week.",
      "She committed to ensuring a smooth transition.",
      "Thao must vacate the office as soon as election results are certified Dec. 5 and the Oakland City Council declares a vacancy at its next meeting, which would be Dec. 17, Nikki Fortunato Bas, City Council president, said in a statement.",
      "A special election for a new mayor will be held within 120 days, or roughly four months.",
      "Until then, Bas \u2014 as president of the City Council \u2014 would serve as interim mayor unless she wins a seat on the Alameda County Board of Supervisors. As of Monday, Bas was trailing in that race.",
      "Thao was elected mayor in November 2022 and became the first Hmong American to lead a major city. She faced criticism almost immediately after taking office for firing popular Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong. Frustrated voters, including the local NAACP, blamed Thao for a long list of city woes related to public safety, homelessness and the city\u2019s budget.",
      "In her statement, Thao said she was proud of her administration\u2019s accomplishments.",
      "Thao was not the only official booted from office in Tuesday\u2019s election. Pamela Price, district attorney for Alameda County, which includes Oakland, also was ousted by voters in a recall election. Critics of both Thao and Price disagreed with the officials\u2019 progressive politics.",
      "Thao went into Tuesday\u2019s election weakened by an FBI raid in June of her home \u2014 along with properties owned by a politically influential family that controls the city\u2019s recycling contract. Thao has maintained her innocence and authorities have not said what they are investigating.",
      "Oakland uses a ranked choice voting system that allows voters to list multiple choices in order of preference. Thao narrowly beat Loren Taylor in 2022 despite getting fewer first-place votes than Taylor.",
      "Oakland has about 400,000 residents and is, at times, more politically liberal than San Francisco. It is Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 hometown.",
      "In recent years, Oakland has lost three professional sports franchises, including Major League Baseball\u2019s Oakland Athletics. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has sent state highway patrol officers, state prosecutors, and surveillance cameras to help Oakland battle crime."

      "WASHINGTON -- Days before Senate Republicans pick their new leader, President-elect Donald Trump is pressuring the candidates to change the rules and empower him to appoint some nominees without a Senate vote.",
      "Republican Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida are running in a secret ballot election Wednesday to lead the GOP conference and replace longtime GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who is stepping aside from the job after almost two decades. All three have courted Trump's support in the race, vying to show who is the closest to the president-elect as they campaign to become majority leader.",
      "Trump has not endorsed in the race, but on Sunday he made clear that he expects the new leader to go around regular Senate order, if necessary, to allow him to fill his Cabinet quickly. In a statement on X and Truth Social, Trump said that the next leader \u201cmust agree\u201d to allow him to make appointments when the chamber is on recess, bypassing a confirmation vote.",
      "\u201cAny Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,\u201d Trump posted, adding that positions should be filled \u201cIMMEDIATELY!\u201d",
      "The Senate has not allowed presidents to make so-called recess appointments since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling limited the president\u2019s power to do so. Since then, the Senate has held brief \u201cpro-forma\u201d sessions when it is out of town for more than 10 days so that a president cannot take advantage of the absence and start filling posts that have not been confirmed.",
      "But with Trump\u2019s approval paramount in the race, all three candidates quickly suggested that they might be willing to reconsider the practice. Scott replied to Trump, \u201c100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible.\u201d And Thune said in a statement that they must \u201cquickly and decisively\u201d act to get nominees in place and that \u201call options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments.\u201d",
      "Cornyn said that \u201cIt is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump \u2019s cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent.\u201d He noted that recess appointments are allowed under the Constitution.",
      "The social media exchange on Sunday became a first test for the three candidates since Trump was decisively elected last week to a second term.",
      "Trump\u2019s relationship with Congress \u2014 especially the advice and consent role afforded to the Senate when it comes to nominations \u2014 was tumultuous in his first term as he chafed at resistance to his selections and sought ways to work around lawmakers. With Trump now entering a second term emboldened by his sweeping election victory, he is already signaling that he expects Senate Republicans, and by extension, their new leader, to fall in line behind his Cabinet selections.",
      "Trump also posted on Sunday that the Senate should not approve any judges in the weeks before Republicans take power next year \u2014 a more difficult demand to fulfill as Democrats will control the floor, and hold the majority of votes, until the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3. Trump posted that \u201cDemocrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.\u201d",
      "With days to go, the race for Senate Republican leader is deeply in flux.",
      "Thune and Cornyn are both well-liked, longtime senators who have served as deputies to McConnell and have been seen as the front-runners, despite past statements criticizing Trump. Scott \u2014 a longtime friend of Trump\u2019s and fierce ally \u2014 has been seen as more of a longshot, but he has mounted an aggressive campaign in recent days on social media and elsewhere with the aim of getting Trump\u2019s endorsement.",
      "Senators who are close to Trump, such as Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida, have endorsed Scott, as have tech mogul Elon Musk and other people who have Trump\u2019s ear.",
      "\u201cWe have to be the change,\u201d Scott said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\" \u201cThat\u2019s what Donald Trump got elected to do, to be the change.\u201d",
      "All three candidates are promising that they will be more open and transparent than McConnell was and that they would give senators more power to get their priorities to the floor. They have also tried to make clear that they would have a much different relationship with Trump than McConnell, who once called the former president a \u201cdespicable human being\u201d behind closed doors.",
      "As the Senate haggles over how to fill Trump\u2019s Cabinet, many of his allies are campaigning for the nominations. Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that there are \u201ca couple of great options on the table.\u201d Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Republican from Tennessee who served as U.S. ambassador to Japan between 2017 and 2019, said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that one of his greatest honors was to represent the Trump administration overseas.

      "DELPHI, Ind. -- A former drugstore worker in the small Indiana community of Delphi was found guilty of murder on Monday in the killings of two teenage girls who vanished during an afternoon hike.",
      "Jurors convicted Richard Allen of two counts of murder and two additional counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping in the 2017 killings of Abigail Williams, 13, and Liberty German, 14.",
      "Allen wasn't arrested for five more years, while the case drew outsized attention from true-crime enthusiasts. His trial followed repeated delays, a leak of evidence, the withdrawal of Allen\u2019s public defenders and their reinstatement by the Indiana Supreme Court.",
      "Reporters inside the courtroom said Allen, 52, showed no reaction as the verdict was delivered, but he looked back at his family at one point. Allen is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 20. He could face up to 130 years in prison.",
      "Outside the courthouse, people on the sidewalk began to cheer as word of the verdict spread.",
      "Indiana State Police spokesman Capt. Ron Galaviz told The Associated Press that the judge\u2019s gag order remains in place and he believes it will until Allen is sentenced. Allen\u2019s lawyers left the courthouse Monday without making statements.",
      "A special judge oversaw the case \u2014 Superior Court Judge Fran Gull who along with the jurors, came from northeastern Indiana\u2019s Allen County. The seven women and five men were sequestered throughout the trial, which began Oct. 18 in the Carroll County seat of Delphi, the girls\u2019 hometown of about 3,000 residents in northwest Indiana where Allen also lived and worked.",
      "Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas McLeland noted in his closing argument that Allen had repeatedly confessed to the killings \u2014 in person, on the phone and in writing. In one of the recordings he replayed for the jury, Allen could be heard telling his wife, \u201cI did it. I killed Abby and Libby.\u201d",
      "McLeland also said Allen is the man seen following the teens in a grainy cell phone video recorded by one of the girls as they crossed an abandoned railroad trestle called the Monon High Bridge.",
      "\u201cRichard Allen is Bridge Guy,\u201d McLeland told jurors. \u201cHe kidnapped them and later murdered them.\u201d",
      "McLeland said it was Allen\u2019s voice that could be heard on the video telling the teens, \u201c Down the hill \u2033 after they crossed the bridge on Feb. 13, 2017. Their bodies were found the next day, their throats cut, in a nearby wooded area.",
      "An investigator testified that Allen told him and another officer that on the day the teens vanished, he was wearing a blue or black Carhartt jacket, jeans and a beanie \u2014 clothing similar to what the man recorded on the bridge wore.",
      "McLeland said an unspent bullet found between the teens\u2019 bodies \u201chad been cycled through\u201d Allen\u2019s .40-caliber Sig Sauer handgun. An Indiana State Police firearms expert told the jury her analysis tied the round to Allen\u2019s handgun.",
      "But a firearms expert called by the defense questioned the analysis, and attorney Bradley Rozzi dismissed it as a \u201cmagic bullet,\u201d saying investigators had made an \u201capples to oranges\u201d comparison of the unspent round to one fired from Allen\u2019s gun.",
      "Allen was arrested in October 2022. He had become a suspect after a retired state government worker who volunteered to help police in the case found paperwork in September 2022 showing that Allen had contacted authorities two days after the girls' bodies were found. That paperwork indicated that Allen had told an officer he had been on the hiking trail the afternoon the girls went missing, according to testimony.",
      "Allen\u2019s defense argued that his confessions are unreliable because he was facing a severe mental health crisis while under the pressure and stress of being locked up in isolation, watched 24 hours a day and taunted by people incarcerated with him. A psychiatrist called by the defense testified that months in solitary confinement could make a person delirious and psychotic.",
      "But Dr. Monica Wala, Allen\u2019s psychologist at the Westville Correctional Facility, said Allen shared details of the crime in some of the confessions, including telling her he slashed the girls\u2019 throats and put tree branches over their bodies. She wrote in a report that Allen told her he abandoned his plans to rape the teens when a van passed nearby. A man whose driveway passes under the Monon High Bridge testified that he was driving home from work in his van around that time.",
      "That van, McLeland told jurors in his closing, was a detail \u201conly the killer would know.\u201d",
      "During cross-examination, Wala acknowledged that she had followed Allen\u2019s case with interest during her personal time even while treating him and that she was a fan of the true-crime genre.",
      "Rozzi said in his closing arguments that Allen is innocent. He said no witness explicitly identified Allen as the man seen on the hiking trail or the bridge the afternoon the girls went missing. And he said no fingerprint, DNA or forensic evidence links Allen to the murder scene.",
      "\u201cHe had every chance to run, but he did not because he didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Rozzi told the jurors.",
      "Allen\u2019s lawyers had sought to argue before the trial that the girls were killed in a ritual sacrifice by members of a white nationalist group known as the Odinists who follow a pagan Norse religion, but the judge ruled against that, saying the defense \u201cfailed to produce admissible evidence\u201d of such a connection."

      "President-elect Donald Trump is starting to fill key posts in his second administration, putting an emphasis so far on aides and allies who were his strongest backers during the 2024 campaign",
      "President-elect Donald Trump is starting to fill key posts in his second administration, putting an emphasis so far on aides and allies who were his strongest backers during the 2024 campaign.",
      "Here's a look at who he's selected so far.",
      "Wiles, 67, was a senior adviser to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and its de facto manager.",
      "Wiles has a background in Florida politics. She helped Ron DeSantis win his first race for Florida governor. Six years later, she was key to Trump's defeat of him in the 2024 Republican primary.",
      "Wiles\u2019 hire was Trump\u2019s first major decision as president-elect and one that could be a defining test of his incoming administration considering her close relationship with the president-elect. Wiles is said to have earned Trump's trust in part by guiding what was the most disciplined of Trump's three presidential campaigns.",
      "Wiles was able to help keep Trump on track as few others have, not by criticizing his impulses, but by winning his respect by demonstrating his success after taking her advice.",
      "Trump asked Waltz, a retired Army National Guard officer and war veteran, to be his national security adviser, a person familiar with the matter said Monday.",
      "The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter before Trump made a formal announcement.",
      "The move would put Waltz at the forefront of a litany of national security crises, ranging from the ongoing effort to provide weapons to Ukraine and escalating worries about the growing alliance between Russia and North Korea to the persistent attacks in the Middle East by Iran proxies and the push for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah.",
      "Waltz is a three-term GOP congressman from east-central Florida. He served multiple tours in Afghanistan and also worked in the Pentagon as a policy adviser when Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates were defense chiefs.",
      "He is considered hawkish on China, and called for a U.S. boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing due to its involvement in the origin of COVID-19 and its ongoing mistreatment of the minority Muslim Uighur population.",
      "Homan, 62, has been tasked with Trump\u2019s top priority of carrying out the largest deportation operation in the nation\u2019s history.",
      "Homan, who served under Trump in his first administration leading U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was widely expected to be offered a position related to the border, an issue Trump made central to his campaign.",
      "Though Homan has insisted such a massive undertaking would be humane, he has long been a loyal supporter of Trump's policy proposals, suggesting at a July conference in Washington that he would be willing to \"run the biggest deportation operation this country\u2019s ever seen.\u201d",
      "Democrats have criticized Homan for his defending Trump's \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy on border crossings during his first administration, which led to the separation of thousands of parents and children seeking asylum at the border.",
      "Stefanik is a representative from New York and one of Trump's staunchest defenders going back to his first impeachment.",
      "Elected to the House in 2014, Stefanik was selected by her GOP House colleagues as House Republican Conference chair in 2021, when former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was removed from the post after publicly criticizing Trump for falsely claiming he won the 2020 election. Stefanik, 40, has served in that role ever since as the third-ranking member of House leadership.",
      "Stefanik\u2019s questioning of university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses helped lead to two of those presidents resigning, further raising her national profile.",
      "If confirmed, she would represent American interests at the U.N. as Trump vows to end the war waged by Russia against Ukraine begun in 2022. He has also called for peace as Israel continues its offensive against Hamas in Gaza and its invasion of Lebanon to target Hezbollah.",
      "Miller, an immigration hardliner, was a vocal spokesperson during the presidential campaign for Trump's priority of mass deportations. The 39-year-old was a senior adviser during Trump's first administration.",
      "Miller has been a central figure in some of Trump's policy decisions, notably his move to separate thousands of immigrant families.",
      "Trump argued throughout the campaign that the nation's economic, national security and social priorities could be met by deporting people who are in the United States illegally. Since Trump left office in 2021, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal, an organization made up of former Trump advisers aimed at challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as free speech and national security.",
      "Trump has chosen former New York Rep. Lee Zeldin to serve as his pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Zeldin does not appear to have any experience in environmental issues, but is a longtime supporter of the former president. The 44-year-old former U.S. House member from New York wrote on X, \u201cWe will restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI.\u201d \u201cWe will do so while protecting access to clean air and water,\u201d he added.",
      "During his campaign, Trump often attacked the Biden administration's promotion of electric vehicles, and incorrectly referring to a tax credit for EV purchases as a government mandate. Trump also often told his audiences during the campaign his administration would \u201cDrill, baby, drill,\u201d referring to his support for expanded petroleum exploration.",
      "In a statement, Trump said Zeldin \u201cwill ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet.\u201d"

      "South Carolina\u2019s Supreme Court has not set a date for the state\u2019s next execution after lawyers for four inmates out of appeals asked them to postpone deaths until after Christmas and New Year\u2019s",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina's Supreme Court has not set a date for the state's next execution after lawyers for four inmates out of appeals asked them to postpone deaths until after Christmas and New Year's.",
      "The justices typically issue notices on Fridays because it gives the maximum amount of time of 28 days to prepare for the execution which by law is to be carried out on the \u201cfourth Friday after the receipt of such notice.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court also promised in August to space out the executions in five week intervals to give prison staff and defense lawyers, who are often representing several condemned inmates, time to handle all the legal matters necessary. That includes making sure the lethal injection drugs as well as the electric chair and firing squad are ready and researching and filing last minute appeals.",
      "South Carolina\u2019s death chamber has a backlog because of a 13-year pause in executions in part because the state couldn\u2019t obtain the drugs needed to carry out lethal injections until the General Assembly passed a law keeping the name of the provider secret.",
      "Six inmates ran out of appeals during that time. Two have been executed and four are awaiting their fate.",
      "The justices could have issued a death warrant this past Friday for Marion Bowman Jr. that would have been carried out on Dec. 6.",
      "But the day passed with no word from the Supreme Court, including what the justices thought of the request from the inmates last Tuesday to take a break from executions until early January.",
      "\u201cSix consecutive executions with virtually no respite will take a substantial toll on all involved, particularly during a time of year that is so important to families,\u201d the lawyers for the inmates wrote in court papers.",
      "Attorneys for the state responded that prison officials were ready to keep to the original schedule and the state has conducted executions around the Christmas and New Year\u2019s holidays before, including five between Dec. 4, 1998, and Jan. 8, 1999.",
      "Bowman, 44, was convicted of murder in the shooting of friend 21-year-old Kandee Martin whose burned body was found in the trunk of her car in Dorchester County in 2001. Bowman has spent more than half his life on death row.",
      "Bowman would be the third inmate executed since September after the state obtained the drug it needed to carry out the death sentence. Freddie Owens was put to death by lethal injection Sept. 20 and Richard Moore was executed on Nov. 1,",
      "South Carolina was among the busiest states for executions back then, but that stopped once the state had trouble obtaining lethal injection drugs because of pharmaceutical companies\u2019 concerns they would have to disclose they had sold the drugs to officials.",
      "The state Legislature has since passed a law allowing officials to keep lethal injection drug suppliers secret, and in July, the state Supreme Court cleared the way to restart executions."

      "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Rep. Elise Stefanik to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations, picking a loyal ally with little foreign policy experience to represent the U.S. at the international organization.",
      "\u201cElise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,\u201d Trump said in a statement Monday announcing his pick for the role \u2014 his first selection that will require Senate confirmation.",
      "Stefanik, 40, who serves as House Republican Conference Chair, has long been one of Trump's most loyal allies in the House, and was among those discussed as a potential vice presidential choice.",
      "She will be thrown into the world body\u2019s deep divisions from the wars in the Mideast and Ukraine to reining in nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran.",
      "She will also come face-to-face almost daily in the U.N. Security Council with the ambassadors of Russia and China whose countries are now strongly allied and looking warily at a second Trump presidency \u2013 and sometimes with their counterparts from North Korea and Iran.",
      "Stefanik will succeed U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat and former assistant secretary of state for Africa who has held the job through the entire Biden administration and has been a member of his Cabinet. Stefanik also will be a member of Trump's Cabinet, he said in the statement.",
      "In Trump\u2019s first administration, he chose former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who had little foreign experience except for some trade missions, for the U.N. post. She resigned after two years and then challenged Trump for the GOP nomination. Haley was succeeded by then U.S. ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft, wife of a Kentucky coal magnate, who in 2023 was unsuccessful in her bid for the GOP nomination for governor of the state.",
      "John Bolton, a former U.S. national security adviser under Trump and ambassador to the U.N. during the Bush administration, told The Associated Press that he sees Stefanik as the 2024 version of Haley.",
      "\u201cShe wants to run for president in 2028. She realizes she has no foreign policy experience so what better way than to become U.N. ambassador,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cShe stays two years, and then away we go.\u201d",
      "Born and raised in upstate New York, Stefanik graduated from Harvard and worked in former President George W. Bush\u2019s White House on the domestic policy council and in the chief of staff\u2019s office.",
      "In 2014, at 30, she became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, representing upstate New York. She later became the youngest woman to serve in House leadership.",
      "Stefanik was known early in her tenure as a more moderate conservative voice. But she soon attached herself to the former president, quietly remaking her image into that of a staunch MAGA ally \u2014 and seeing her power ascend.",
      "She became the House Republican Conference Chair in 2021.",
      "Stefanik spent years positioning herself as one of Trump\u2019s most trusted allies and confidants on the Hill. She endorsed him in the 2024 race before he had even launched his bid, and aggressively campaigned on his behalf during the GOP primary.",
      "She saw her profile rise after her aggressive questioning of a trio of university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses led to two of their resignations \u2014 a performance Trump repeatedly praised.",
      "She also defended him vigorously in both of his impeachment trials and railed against his four criminal indictments, including filing an ethics complaint in New York against the judge who heard his civil fraud case.",
      "While she is a member of the House Armed Services Committee and serves on the coveted House committee that oversees national intelligence, her pick further solidifies Trump\u2019s preference for unconditional loyalty in his second administration over career experience.",
      "One area of foreign policy that Stefanik has been vocal about is Israel.",
      "Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, Stefanik has focused much of her attention on the United Nations, accusing the world body and international organizations of antisemitism for their criticism of Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza, which has resulted in the death of more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to their Health Ministry.",
      "She has gone as far as calling last month for a \u201ccomplete reassessment\u201d of U.S. funding for the United Nations, while helping push for the blocking of American support for the U.N. agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the region.",
      "Her departure for the United Nations would also mean that Republicans, who are on track to have a razor-thin majority in the House, would be down one crucial vote. But Stefanik\u2019s district is located in a deeply red part of upstate New York, where Republicans are likely guaranteed to win the special election that would take place after she leaves office.",
      "\u201cRepublicans will hold this safe Republican seat as part of a Republican majority in the House that will help deliver on President Trump\u2019s historic mandate,\u201d Ed Cox, the chair of the New York Republican party, said in a statement Monday.",
      "Trump did not say much about the U.N. during his campaign, but has generally advocated for a less interventionist foreign policy. He also has repeatedly questioned the utility of international alliances, including NATO, and he has threatened allies with higher tariffs and said he will not protect them unless they contribute more to their own defense.",
      "Trump also has talked about how he initially wanted to select his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, for the role after he was elected the first time.",
      "\u201c'You would be a great ambassador to the United Nations, United Nations secretary.' There\u2019d be nobody to compete with her, I tell you,\u201d he said at a Moms for Liberty Summit in August. \u201cShe may be my daughter, but nobody could have competed with her.\"",

      "In a letter sent to the federal judge on Monday, an attorney for Adams, Alex Spiro, requested the trial begin on April 1 rather than the current planned date of April 23.",
      "\u201cAn earlier trial date will ensure that Mayor Adams\u2019s speedy trial rights are upheld, that the Mayor will be able to fully participate in his reelection campaign and that this City\u2019s voters can be rid of the distraction of this misguided indictment as they hear from and evaluate the Democratic candidates for Mayor on their merits,\u201d Spiro wrote.",
      "Adams, a Democrat, was indicted in September on charges that he accepted luxury travel perks and illegal campaign contributions from a Turkish official seeking political favors. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and insisted he will remain in office as he fights the case.",
      "He is expected to face a contested Democratic primary in June, with several opponents already announcing their interest in challenging him.",
      "Inquiries to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan were not returned.",
      "At a hearing earlier this month, prosecutors said they would be ready for a trial whenever it is scheduled, but noted they were still making their way through reams of seized records and had not yet accessed Adams\u2019 personal cellphone. According to his indictment. Adams changed his password just before giving the phone to authorities, then claimed he forgot it.",
      "In his letter on Monday, Spiro said he would waive access to certain discovery materials if it meant speeding up the date of the trial. Under the current schedule, he predicted a verdict would come in late May, giving the mayor only a short window of time to clear his name among voters.",
      "\u201cGiven the realities of the news and election cycle, this earlier trial date is not only feasible, but essential here,\u201d Spiro wrote."

      "Most U.S. stocks rose on Wall Street, but drops for Nvidia and some other heavyweight Big Tech companies kept indexes in check",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks rose Monday, led by those seen as benefiting the most from Donald Trump\u2019s reelection  as president, but drops for some high-profile Big Tech stocks kept indexes in check.",
      "The S&P 500 edged up by 0.1%, coming off its best week of the year following Trump\u2019s victory and a cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve to bolster the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 304 points, or 0.7%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.1%.",
      "Tesla was the strongest force pushing upward on the S&P 500 after rising 9.1%. Its leader, Elon Musk, has become a close ally of Trump\u2019s, and its stock jumped nearly 15% the day after the election and has kept rising.",
      "Several pieces of what\u2019s known as the \u201cTrump trade\u201d also helped drive the market, as investors try to identify which companies will be winners under a second Trump term. JPMorgan Chase rose 1%, and financial stocks again helped lead the market on expectations for stronger economic growth, less regulation from Washington and an increase in mergers and acquisitions.",
      "A White House more friendly to big tie-ups has helped Wall Street speculate about a merger between insurers Cigna Group and Humana, for example. It\u2019s been so feverish that Cigna said Monday it isn\u2019t pursuing a deal with Humana. Cigna\u2019s stock rose 7.3%, and Humana\u2019s sank 2%.",
      "Stocks of companies more focused on the U.S. economy were also rising more than the rest of the market, including a 1.5% rally for the smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index, because they\u2019re seen as benefiting more from Trump\u2019s America First policies than big multinational companies.",
      "They helped offset a drop of 1.6% for Nvidia, which was the heaviest weight on the market.",
      "Such Big Tech stocks have rocketed higher on excitement about artificial-intelligence technology, and they had been gaining almost regardless of what the economy was doing. Now, though, critics say their prices look too expensive, and investors are finding more interesting buys among companies that could benefit more from Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "A drop for Nvidia packs a particularly heavy punch because its massive value of nearly $3.6 trillion makes it one of the most influential stocks on the S&P 500 and other indexes.",
      "AbbVie, meanwhile, tumbled 12.6% after saying trials investigating its treatment for some adults with schizophrenia failed to show statistically significant improvement compared with a placebo group at week six.",
      "Some of the sharpest swings were in the crypto market, where bitcoin rose above $87,000 for the first time. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies  generally and pledged to make his country the crypto capital of the world. Bitcoin hit a record of $87,491, according to CoinDesk.",
      "Another Trump trade has been a rise in Treasury yields, as traders anticipate potentially higher economic growth, U.S. government debt and inflation because of Trump\u2019s policies. But trading in the bond market was closed Monday in observance of Veterans Day.",
      "Treasury yields been generally climbing since September, in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it\u2019s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target.",
      "But Trump\u2019s win has scrambled expectations for coming cuts to rates. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many the Fed will deliver next year. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel.",
      "Still, many professional investors warn not to get carried away by all the big swings following Trump\u2019s victory. It takes time to see what campaign promises turn into actual policy, and that can lead to snaps back for the market\u2019s initial knee-jerk reactions.",
      "The U.S. stock market is also broadly looking more expensive, as prices continue to run up faster than corporate profits.",
      "\u201cValuations are increasingly elevated, and the pace of growth isn\u2019t sustainable,\u201d according to Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide. \u201cWhile near-term seasonality will be a strong tailwind for markets, valuations may prove to be a tipping point as we move into 2025.\u201d",
      "All told, the S&P 500 rose 5.81 points Monday to 6,001.35. The Dow gained 304.14 to 44,293.13, and the Nasdaq composite added 11.99 to 19,298.76.",
      "Stock markets abroad have swung following Trump\u2019s election amid worries about increased tariffs and disruptions to global trade. They were mixed Monday, with European indexes rising while South Korea\u2019s and Hong Kong\u2019s sank.",

      "State Sens. John McGuire and Suhas Subramanyam landed the congressional wins on Election Day. That means there are vacant spots for their Statehouse positions. McGuire, a Republican, represented a rural district in central Virginia. Subramanyam, a Democrat, represented a Washington-area exurb.",
      "According to Virginia law, House and Senate leaders are tasked with calling such elections when the legislature is in a special session. The special session has been active since last May. The law also requires a special election to be set \u201cwithin 30 days of the vacancy or receipt of notification of the vacancy, whichever comes first.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Senate President Pro Tempore L. Louise Lucas said the election to replace Subramanyam will happen Jan. 7. Lucas has not yet called an election to replace McGuire's seat.",
      "Senate Democrats have a narrow 21-19 majority, making the special elections key to the party's efforts to preserve a majority in both chambers.",
      "Democrats in Loudoun County, home to Subramanyam\u2019s district, said in a press release last Wednesday that local party members would vote for their candidate on Nov. 16.",
      "State Del. Kannan Srinivasan, who was elected last year to represent the district in the House of Delegates, and former Del. Ibraheem Samirah, said in statements to The Associated Press that they would seek the Democratic nomination to succeed Subramanyam. Former Loudoun County Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Buta Biberaj also informed the AP that she would run to be the party nominee.",
      "As reported by the Richmond Times-Dispatch, multiple Republicans have announced their interest in McGuire\u2019s seat, including former state Sen. Amanda Chase and her former staffer, Shayne Snavely. Duane Adams, a Louisa County board supervisor, and Jean Gannon, a longtime Republican activist, have also announced their candidacies.",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom is heading to Washington this week to meet with the Biden administration",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom plans to meet with the Biden administration this week to discuss zero-emission vehicles and disaster relief \u2014 issues that have been targeted in the past by President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The Democratic governor is leaving for Washington on Monday and will return home Wednesday, his office said. Newsom will also meet with California\u2019s congressional delegation.",
      "He is seeking federal approval for state climate rules, a $5.2 billion reimbursement for emergency funding during the COVID-19 pandemic and updates to the state's Medicaid program, along with other priorities.",
      "The trip comes days after Newsom called for state lawmakers to convene a special session in December to protect California's liberal policies ahead of Trump's return to office in January.",
      "Trump then criticized the governor on social media, calling out the high cost of living in California and the state's homelessness crisis. He said Newsom was \u201cstopping all of the GREAT things that can be done to 'Make California Great Again.'\u201d",
      "California won against most of the Trump administration's legal challenges over the state's environmental and other progressive policies during the Republican's first term, said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at the University of California San Diego.",
      "\u201cThe question is: Has Donald Trump changed the legal playing field so much through the court appointments of his first term that he'll be able to win on policies in his second term?\u201d he said.",
      "As president, Trump appointed more than 230 federal judges, including three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The Trump administration in 2019 revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its own tailpipe emissions standards. President Joe Biden later restored the state\u2019s authority, which was upheld in federal court.",
      "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency typically sets standards for emissions from passenger cars, trucks and other vehicles, but California has historically been granted waivers to impose its own, stricter standards.",
      "California has eight climate rules awaiting waivers from the EPA. They include measures to require all new cars sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035, transition away from diesel-powered trains, and update emission standards for pollutants from heavy-duty vehicles.",
      "Gil Cisneros, who was elected to represent Los Angeles County in the U.S. House of Representatives, said in an email that his fellow Democrats have a responsibility to protect key policies even if Republicans retain control of the House.",
      "\u201cIf Donald Trump follows through with such promises as eliminating the Affordable Care Act, mass deportations, raising tariffs ... it is beholden on us to communicate to the American people and convince them how his policies will hurt the economy and their pocket book,\u201d Cisneros said. \u201cThat is how we will be better able to resist him.\u201d",
      "In remarks to Fox 11 in Los Angeles, Democratic Sen.-elect Adam Schiff said he was ready to work with Trump to bring down costs and strengthen the economy.",
      "But \u201cshould he move to try to take away the rights and freedoms of Californians, should he move to try to tear down the guardrails of our democracy, as before, he will meet a vigorous opponent in me,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cI will do whatever is necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of my constituents.\u201d",
      "Trump resoundingly defeated Vice President Kamala Harris, a former California prosecutor, in the battle for the nation\u2019s top job. Newsom has become a foil for Trump over the years, and he was a prominent advocate for Biden\u2019s \u2014 and then Harris\u2019 \u2014 campaign.",

      "Revered abolitionist Harriet Tubman has been posthumously awarded the rank of general",
      "CHURCH CREEK, Md. -- Revered abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who was the first woman to oversee an American military action during a time of war, was posthumously awarded the rank of general on Monday.",
      "Dozens gathered on Veterans Day at the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park in Maryland's Dorcester County for a formal ceremony making Tubman a one-star brigadier general in the state's National Guard.",
      "Gov. Wes Moore called the occasion not just a great day for Tubman's home state but for all of the U.S.",
      "\u201cToday, we celebrate a soldier and a person who earned the title of veteran,\" Moore said. \"Today we celebrate one of the greatest authors of the American story.\u201d",
      "Tubman escaped slavery herself in 1849 and settled in Philadelphia. Intent on helping others achieve freedom, she established the Underground Railroad network and led other enslaved Black women and men to freedom. She then channeled those experiences as a scout, spy and nurse for the Union Army during the Civil War, helping guide 150 Black soldiers on a gunboat raid in South Carolina.",
      "Nobody would have judged Tubman had she chosen to remain in Philadelphia and coordinate abolitionist efforts from there, Moore said.",
      "\u201cShe knew that in order to do the work, that meant that she had to go into the lion\u2019s den,\u201d Moore siad. \u201cShe knew that leadership means you have to be willing to do what you are asking others to do.\u201d",
      "The reading of the official order was followed by a symbolic pinning ceremony with Tubman's great-great-great-grandniece, Tina Wyatt.",
      "Wyatt hailed her aunt's legacy of tenacity, generosity and faith and agreed Veterans Day applied to her as much as any other servicemember.",
      "\u201cAunt Harriet was one of those veterans informally, she gave up any rights that she had obtained for herself to be able to fight for others,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cShe is a selfless person.\u201d",
      "Tubman's status as an icon of history has only been further elevated within the last few years. The city of Philadelphia chose a Black artist to make a 14-foot (4.3-meter) bronze statue to go on display next year. In 2022, a Chicago elementary school was renamed for Tubman, replacing the previous namesake, who had racist views. However, plans to put Tubman on the $20 bill have continued to stall."

    "story": [
      "Congress has a short but important to-do list as lawmakers return to Washington this coming week for what is known as a lame-duck session",
      "WASHINGTON -- Keeping the federal government open. Providing more disaster aid. Passing a defense policy bill. And for Senate Democrats, confirming more judges.",
      "It's a short but important to-do list as Congress returns to Washington this week to begin what is known as a lame-duck session \u2014 that period between Election Day and the end of the two-year congressional term.",
      "Republicans are anxious to turn the page and move on to next year when they'll have control of the White House and possibly both chambers of Congress, while Democrats hope to get in as many of their priorities as they can while they still have the majority in the Senate.",
      "Here's a look at where things stand going into the final weeks of the tumultuous 118th Congress:",
      "Just before lawmakers left Washington in September, they passed a short-term extension of government funding to avoid a shutdown before the election. They still need to pass full-year spending bills for the current fiscal year, or at least another extension, by Dec. 20.",
      "A Republican aide in the House and another in the Senate not authorized to speak publicly about internal planning said it is likely that Congress will pass another short-term extension into early next year rather than complete work on the bills.",
      "That's because the two sides still have major differences on spending levels and policy priorities. Also, Republicans have less incentive to negotiate now because they will have control of the White House, Senate and possibly the House come January.",
      "Much will depend upon whether government funding is a fight President-elect Donald Trump really wants to take on in his first few weeks as president or whether he'd prefer to focus on other priorities.",
      "Under terms of a previous deal that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy reached with the Biden administration, spending for defense and nondefense programs would rise 1% this fiscal year.",
      "The Senate has been charting a course to go above that level, while House Republicans have been voting for steep cuts to many non-defense programs, and they have attached policy mandates to the spending bills that Democrats overwhelmingly oppose. So a final agreement will be difficult to reach this Congress.",
      "Congress replenished the Federal Emergency Management Agency 's disaster relief fund with more than $20 billion in September. But that money is being spent quickly in the wake of Hurricanes Helene and Milton.",
      "Congress is expected to take up a supplemental disaster funding package at some point during the lame-duck. But, for now, lawmakers are awaiting a request from the Biden administration on what additional money will be needed for FEMA's disaster fund and for other disaster aid programs, such as Small Business Administration program that provides low-interest loans to businesses and homeowners hit with property damage. The program ran out of money in mid-October, though the agency continues to take applications, so it can move quickly when Congress does provide funding.",
      "Lawmakers are expecting a hefty request.",
      "When visiting North Carolina after Hurricane Helene, House Speaker Mike Johnson said Congress provided money to meet immediate needs and would at the appropriate time \"act in a bipartisan fashion to supply what is needed to help these communities recover, the appropriate amount that the federal government should do.\u201d",
      "Congress for more than six decades has passed an annual defense policy bill that authorizes specific weapons systems and sets troop strength and pay levels.",
      "The House passed its $895.2 billion measure in June. That amounts to a 1% increase from the last fiscal year, an amount in keeping with the spending caps set by the McCarthy-White House agreement. The measure provided a 19.5% boost in pay for junior enlisted service members and a 4.5% increase for other service members. But the measure was also filled with scores of conservative policy mandates, including overturning the Pentagon's policy of reimbursing transportation expenses to service members for travel out of state for an abortion.",
      "The inclusion of culture war provisions turned what is typically a bipartisan bill into one that the vast majority of House Democrats opposed.",
      "The Senate version would authorize about $919.9 billion in spending. The bipartisan measure passed out of committee in July, but has not been brought to the floor as Democrats reserved precious floor time for other priorities. But behind the scenes, lawmakers have been negotiating to reconcile the differences in the two bills.",
      "Democrats have made confirming judges a high priority after watching Trump get 234 judges confirmed during his first four years in office.",
      "So far, the Senate has confirmed 213 of President Joe Biden 's judicial nominees, and a committee spokesman said the chairman, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., aims to confirm every nominee possible by the end of the Congress. Seventeen nominees are pending on the floor and several more are pending in committee.",
      "It's possible that Biden could beat Trump's overall number, but Trump still gets the edge when it comes to the most important nominations \u2014 those to the Supreme Court, with Trump appointing three and Biden appointing one. Trump also had more appellate court judges confirmed.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has already lined up votes on two judges next week, an indication of the priority Democrats are placing on the issue during the lame-duck."

      "The court said Sunday that election officials in eight of the state's 15 counties reported that all voters with \u201cinconsistent signatures\u201d had been properly notified and given an opportunity to respond.",
      "Arizona law calls for people who vote by mail to receive notice of problems such as a ballot signature that doesn\u2019t match one on file and get a \u201creasonable\u201d chance to correct it in a process known as \u201ccuring.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Court has no information to establish in fact that any such individuals did not have the benefit of \u2018reasonable efforts\u2019 to cure their ballots,\u201d wrote Justice Bill Montgomery, who served as duty judge for the seven-member court.

      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice for defense secretary is still up in the air, but it\u2019s a sure bet he will look to reshape the Pentagon and pick a loyalist",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's choice for defense secretary is still up in the air, but it is a sure bet he will look to reshape the Pentagon and pick a loyalist. During his tumultuous first term, five men held the job as Pentagon chief only to resign, be fired or serve briefly as a stopgap.",
      "While he has yet to announce a decision, the names of potential Pentagon chiefs stretch from the well known \u2014 such as Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee \u2014 to an array of former administration loyalists, including retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, who held national security posts during Trump's first term.",
      "Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been floated, but Trump said on social media Saturday that Pompeo would not be joining the new administration. Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida had also been mentioned, but he's now been tapped to be Trump's national security adviser.",
      "Some decisions may linger for days as candidates jostle for attention and officials wait for the final results from House races, weighing whether Republican lawmakers can be tapped or if others are a safer pick to avoid a new election for an empty congressional seat.",
      "\u201cThe choice is going to tell us a lot about how he will deal with the Pentagon,\u201d said Mark Cancian, senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a retired Marine colonel.",
      "He said someone with a deep military background may not be as dramatic of a change as others who may be viewed as stronger Trump loyalists.",
      "With a number of top jobs at the State Department, National Security Council and Defense Department up for grabs, Trump is expected to lean toward those who back his desire to end U.S. involvement in any wars, use the military to control the U.S.-Mexico border and take a hard line on Iran.",
      "The key test, however, will be loyalty and a willingness to do whatever Trump wants, as he seeks to avoid the pushback he got from the Pentagon the first time around.",
      "Trump's relationship with his civilian and military leaders during those years was fraught with tension, confusion and frustration, as they struggled to temper or even simply interpret presidential tweets and pronouncements that blindsided them with abrupt policy decisions they weren't prepared to explain or defend.",
      "Time after time, senior Pentagon officials \u2014 both in and out of uniform \u2014 worked to dissuade, delay or derail Trump, on issues ranging from his early demand to prohibit transgender troops from serving in the military and his announcements that he was pulling troops out of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan to his push to use troops to police the border and stem civil unrest on the streets of Washington.",
      "In his first administration, Trump hewed toward what he considered strong military men and defense industry executives. Initially enamored with generals, Trump over time found them to be not loyal enough.",
      "\u201cHe soured on them,\u201d Cancian said. \u201cThey were not as pliable as he had thought. ... I\u2019ve heard people speculate that maybe the chairman would be fired. So that\u2019s something to watch.\u201d",
      "Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, took over as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 2023 for a four-year term, but military leaders serve at the pleasure of the president. Brown, a combat pilot and just the second Black officer to serve as chairman, spoke out after the police killing of George Floyd, describing the bias he faced in his life and career.",
      "Trump also is expected to choose someone as defense secretary with disdain for equity and diversity programs and less likely to counter his plans based on limits laid out in the Constitution and rule of law. But he also may well push for increased defense spending, at least initially, including on U.S. missile defense.",
      "A key overriding concern is that Trump will select someone who won't push back against potentially unlawful or dangerous orders or protect the military's longstanding apolitical status.",
      "On Thursday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin raised that red flag. In a message to the force, he said the U.S. military stands ready to \u201cobey all lawful orders from its civilian chain of command,\u201d adding that troops swear an oath to \u201csupport and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d",
      "He echoed retired Army Gen. Mark Milley's pronouncement during a speech as he closed out four years as chairman of the Joint Chiefs.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t take an oath to a king or a queen or to a tyrant or a dictator. And we don\u2019t take an oath to a wannabe dictator,\u201d Milley said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take an oath to an individual. We take an oath to the Constitution, and we take an oath to the idea that is America, and we\u2019re willing to die to protect it.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s first defense chief, retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, learned quickly to stay off his boss\u2019 radar by largely eliminating press conferences that Trump could see.",
      "Mattis and Milley, along with Trump's chief of staff John Kelly, a retired Marine general, and retired Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, who also served as Joint Chiefs chairman, all worked quietly behind the scenes to temper some of Trump's decisions.",
      "They stalled his demands that troops be quickly and completely withdrawn from Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan and managed to prevent the use of active-duty troops to quell civil unrest in Washington.",
      "Two years in, Mattis abruptly resigned in December 2018 in frustration over Trump\u2019s national security policies, including a perceived disdain for allies and his demands to pull all troops out of Syria. Patrick Shanahan, the deputy defense secretary, took over as acting Pentagon chief but withdrew as the nominee six months later due to personal family problems that were made public.",
      "Then-Army Secretary Mark Esper took over in an acting role, but he had to step aside briefly when nominated, so Navy Secretary Richard Spencer served as the acting chief until Esper was confirmed.",
      "Esper was fired days after Trump lost the 2020 election, largely because the president did not believe him to be loyal enough. Trump was especially angry over Esper\u2019s public opposition to invoking the two-centuries-old Insurrection Act to deploy active-duty troops in the District of Columbia during unrest following the police killing of George Floyd.",
      "Trump named Christopher Miller, a retired Army officer who has been director of the National Counterterrorism Center, to serve as acting secretary and surrounded him with staunch loyalists.",
      "That is the Pentagon that officials quietly say they expect to see in Trump's new administration."

      "He agreed that this would be an issue for sub-postmasters currently using Horizon.",
      "In his second appearance in front of the inquiry, Patterson also admitted that he did not know whether Fujitsu had done an independent report into the software system.",
      "Though he added that he would welcome a third-party investigation.",
      "Between 1999 and 2015, hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses were wrongly prosecuted after Horizon made it look like money was missing from their branches.",
      "Fujitsu's Horizon contract is up for renewal early next year and could be extended for a further five years.",
      "Patterson said he was \"very worried\" about what might happen if this happens because of how unreliable Horizon is.",
      "\"In my experience... if you don\u2019t keep [IT systems] upgraded, I cannot determine what will or will not happen, which is part of my nervousness of it being extended,\" he said.",

      "Mr Patterson said Fujitsu was committed to paying out compensation to the victims of the scandal, calling it a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d, but said the firm was waiting until the end of the inquiry before actually doing so.",
      "In a heated exchange with Sam Stein KC, who represented some of the victims, Mr Patterson was pushed on why this was.",
      "\u201cYou already accept that there is a need for Fujitsu to put its money where its mouth is,\u201d said Mr Stein.",

      "The government needed to be \"seen to be doing the right thing\", said Badenoch.",
      "She accepted at the inquiry into the scandal that it was \"extremely disappointing\" that it took the ITV drama to escalate the issue.",
      "But she said her row with the Treasury over the time it was taking to issue compensation last August was not just a case of her \"posturing\".",
      "Badenoch said Mr Bates vs The Post Office, which was broadcast in January, raised awareness of the issue, turning compensation from \"a value for money perception to a public perception question\".",
      "She insisted work was being done on the issue by the previous government, but admitted it was \"too slow\" and criticised the whole \"government machine\" for slowing down compensation.",
      "The inquiry heard how Badenoch told the Treasury she wanted to give \u00a3100,000 \"flat offers\" to all sub-postmasters with a claim, with the inquiry to the counsel Jason Beer KC describing her mention of \"ministerial direction\" as a threat.",
      "He said this could be seen as \"soft power\" or \"posturing\".",
      "But Badenoch denied the claim, saying: \"It was signalling the direction I wanted the department to take to make it very clear.\"",
      "She said she believed speed should triumph over accuracy, and admitted that this might not have represented value for money from a taxpayer point of view.",
      "'Vanilla updates'",
      "Badenoch was also questioned over her sacking of former Post Office chairman Henry Staunton.",
      "She said she was not aware of how serious concerns were about him because of \"vanilla updates\" from civil servants.",
      "Her evidence statement provided her reasons for Staunton's dismissal, which included the former chairman attempting to shut down a whistleblowing probe into his conduct, behaving in an aggressive, intimidating and disrespectful manner, and having a poor understanding of Post Office's work.",

    "summary": "Technology differences mean meters in northern England and Scotland may not work properly, energy firm body admits.",
    "story": [
      "The way smart energy meters work in northern England and Scotland is causing issues for customers, BBC Panorama has been told.",
      "The body that represents energy companies, Energy UK, has confirmed for the first time there is a regional divide - because of the way meters send usage data back to suppliers.",
      "The technology used in the north of Great Britain can affect whether smart meters work properly - and could leave customers having to submit manual readings and receiving estimated bills.",
      "The issues have also been confirmed by meter engineers who have spoken to the BBC.",
      "In the Midlands, Wales and southern England, all meters use cellular technology - similar to mobile phones - to send data to energy providers.",
      "But in northern England and Scotland, meters instead rely on longer-range radio frequencies.",
      "It is a legal requirement, the government says, for suppliers to make sure smart meters are working and it expects suppliers to \u201cresolve all issues at a much faster pace\u201d.",
      "The mass roll-out of smart meters began 12 years ago, with the goal of helping people save money on their bills, while lowering carbon emissions as part of the government\u2019s net zero plan.",
      "By showing how much energy households are using, and how much it is costing, meters are intended to encourage people to use more energy at times of day when it is cheaper - because there is a surplus while most are in bed and factories are closed.",
      "As more energy comes from renewable sources, smart meters will form a vital part of a \u201csmart grid\u201d, allowing consumers\u2019 demand for energy to match the available supply, minute-by-minute.",
      "The cost of installing smart meters across Great Britain is estimated to be \u00a313.5bn, according to the government. There are 36 million such devices in England, Wales and Scotland - but recent government figures show 3.5 million of them are not working properly.",
      "As a rule of thumb, smart meters in the northern region designed to connect to the radio signal have two small indicator lights on the communications hub, fitted to the top of the smart meter. The hubs fitted to smart meters in central and southern regions, receiving the cellular signal, usually have five of these indicator lights.",
      "Northern Ireland\u2019s energy market is separate with its own rules and regulator - and a consultation on a proposed smart meter roll-out is taking place.",
      "Hartesh Battu, a doctor from Glasgow, has had six different smart meters, fitted by two energy suppliers, none of which have worked. \u201cI just think it\u2019s astonishingly bad in terms of the technology,\u201d he told us. \u201cI do feel like, \u2018how could billions of pounds be spent on something so bad?\u2019\u201d",
      "He told the BBC he had wanted a smart meter so he could save energy on his bills and take advantage of a night-time rate that would make it cheaper to charge his electric car.",
      "His current energy supplier, Octopus Energy, told him the problem was down to signal issues in the area and may be because he lived \u201cfar up north\u201d - reasoning that left him feeling deeply unimpressed. \u201cI just thought that was a bit bonkers because I live in Glasgow, I\u2019m hardly up in Shetland, I\u2019m not rural at all.\u201d",
      "When the mass roll-out started, the decision to use radio signals across northern England and Scotland - rather than the mobile technology further south - was because it was thought the signals would be able to travel far across the hills and mountains, reaching more rural communities more easily.",
      "But Energy UK admits there are problems regarding how the radio signals transmit. \u201cThere are issues in the north,\u201d chief executive Dhara Vyas told us.",
      "She said there were \u201clive conversations\u201d within the industry about increasing the network range in the north of England and Scotland.",
      "This technological divide has been experienced by smart meter engineers who have spoken anonymously to Panorama.",
      "One engineer, \u201cAhmed\u201d told us there were more problems in northern England and Scotland on average, adding that the technology further south was more up to date.",
      "\u201cYou can end up going to someone\u2019s house at the bottom of a mountain in the north and the radio frequency can\u2019t get through. But there could be a good 3G signal nearby and that could get through - the customer doesn\u2019t know that,\u201d he said.",
      "Another engineer, \u201cSteve\u201d working for a major energy supplier in Merseyside, who has experience of installing meters in homes on both sides of the regional divide, told us it was \u201cfar easier to complete a successful installation\u201d in the south and Midlands where he could use the cellular network.",
      "The truth about smart meters",
      "Smart meters are supposed to make paying our energy bills easier and cheaper. But is that the whole story?",
      "Watch now on BBC iPlayer - or on BBC One on Monday 11 November at 20:00 (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland).",
      "Energy suppliers do not have direct control over the communication network - in both the north and south. Instead it is run by an organisation known as the Data Communications Company (DCC) and is operated by outsourcing company, Capita.",
      "Panorama contacted Dr Battu\u2019s energy supplier, Octopus Energy, about the problems he was having with his meter. The company said the situation was \u201cfrustrating\u201d because government regulations dictated it must use the radio-wave technology to provide a signal to Dr Battu\u2019s meter - and that it was not permitted to access the local 3G signal instead.",
      "However, in what they described as \u201ca highly unusual move\u201d, Octopus told us that it had in fact decided to break the rules and fix his meter by connecting it to the mobile network. It added that \u201cregulation has not moved with technology\u201d.",
      "Capita told the BBC it advised energy suppliers against using alternative technological solutions, because that would mean there was no contractual or consumer protection for the meter user to ensure service was maintained or problems addressed.",
      "It said the network it runs provides 99.3% coverage across Great Britain, adding that it was \u201cfully committed to resolving connection issues\u201d.",
      "In a statement it added: \u201cThe DCC is actively working with government to provide a future-proof 4G technology solution for the whole of Britain.\u201d",
      "Most energy users pay a little bit extra on their bills towards the cost of installing and fixing smart meters. That is supposed to be offset by the savings they could make and the environmental benefits.",
      "Energy suppliers are primarily responsible for funding the communications infrastructure - and, according to the National Audit Office, some or all of these costs are passed on to consumers in bills.",
      "The latest figures show that nine in 10 smart meters are working fine. But a recent survey by Citizens\u2019 Advice suggests one in five households have had to regularly send manual meter readings because their smart meters haven\u2019t worked properly.",
      "The government told Panorama that \u201cwhile over 90% of smart meters are operating normally\u2019\u2019 the number not working properly was \u201cstill too high\u201d and, as a result, \u201cmany households are missing out on cheaper, flexible tariffs\u201d.",
      "It also said that a recent customer experience survey by Ofgem \u201cfound no statistically significant differences\u201d in the proportion of customers reporting that their meter was not sending readings to their suppliers for areas in, or predominantly\u202fin, the north.",
      "Most experts agree smart meters can help to deliver lower bills and lower carbon emissions. But if the tech problems continue, that could put people off having them and undermine the government\u2019s goal of getting them into every home."

      "They are supported by a further 209 businesses, together employing tens of thousands of people across the UK.",

      "This fall could happen if the President-elect went through with his repeated campaign promise to levy a 20% tax on all imports, and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports.",

      "We\u2019re just over a week into November and the 27-year-old, who is a social media manager at fashion brand PrettyLittleThing but also makes TikToks on her personal account, has already posted a dozen advent calendar videos. Everything from chocolate, to beauty products and wine, and even a Pets At Home calendar for her dog.",
      "\"There\u2019s one - the Harrods 12-day one \u2013 where every product in it is something that I would buy,\" she says. \"So I\u2019m saving money.\"",
      "That idea of saving money is something that brands latch on to with their marketing. A calendar may cost \u00a3250 but it\u2019s actually \"worth \u00a31,000\", they say, if you add up all the individual items.",
      "\"But you do have to want the actual products,\" says Cissy. \"Otherwise, it\u2019s a bit of a waste of money.\"",
      "Retailers can afford to make such seemingly good offers because there\u2019s a lot of margin built into beauty products, analysts say.",
      "And rather than aiming to make a big profit on them, they view advent calendars as a marketing tool to get you to buy more products afterwards.",
      "\"A lot of retailers recognise advent calendars are a great way of getting new products to the consumer and a way to get them to convert,\" says Natalie Berg from NBK Retail.",
      "However, Sarah Johnson from Flourish Retail says that while there are many lovely bespoke calendars out there, \"a lot [of companies] just use advent calendars to shift stock that may not be popular, rather than having to discount it\".",

      "The size of the items in advent calendars can vary \u2013 with some offering full-sized bottles, some smaller versions, and some a mix of the two.",
      "But smaller sizes may be what people want, says Ms Berg, as it's common to want to try something out before fully committing.",
      "Holly May Arnott agrees. \"They\u2019re a fantastic way to try new and trending products that I might have seen previously on social media,\" she says.",

      "However, even if a product may seem like good value for money, for some, spending more than \u00a3200 on an advent calendar is simply a luxury they cannot afford.",

      "But part of the reason beauty advent calendars are so popular is because shoppers still want to treat themselves, says Natalie Berg.",
      "And many are willing to pay full price \u2013 and beyond.",
      "The likes of Space NK, Harrods and Sephora have all sold out of their main calendars already.",

      "It might make sense to buy it even at an overinflated price, she says, if the retailer is sold out and you can\u2019t get it anywhere else, especially if you perceive it as still making a saving on the total value of all the items.",

      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 00:06:39 GMT",
    "summary": "Deputy PM admits former Soviet state was until recently a 'highly corrupt country' - but insists things are changing fast.",
    "story": [
      "The Eastern European country of Moldova is continuing efforts to attract overseas firms, as it tries to move past political uncertainty.",
      "\"I went with a backpack, and set up a business,\" says Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, recalling how he moved to Moldova in 2007.",
      "Mr Vocks had first visited the former Soviet republic three years earlier, and recalls experiencing \"the clich\u00e9 that one would have of Eastern Europe at that time\".",
      "\"Everything was dirt cheap, and if you were a foreigner you'd get attention,\" he says.",
      "Today, Mr Vocks is the owner of a Moldovan company called DevelopmentAid. Based in the capital Chisinau, it employs 180 people in the country, and runs a website that lists job vacancies in the international development community.",
      "Mr Vocks is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs in Moldova. The government wants to attract more like him and hopes that low business tax rates will help.",
      "The country's standard corporation tax rate - the amount that firms have to pay on their profits - is just 12%. This compares with 25% in the UK, and 25.8% in the Netherlands where Mr Vocks had initially launched his company before relocating it to Moldova.",
      "There's an even better deal for tech firms. In 2018 the Moldovan government launched an initiative to grow the country's IT sector - the Moldova IT Park (MITP).",
      "This isn't a physical business park. Instead it is virtual scheme open to all IT firms in the country - and those that wish to move there from overseas. Firms that sign up only have to pay a corporation tax rate of 7%.",
      "The MITP is part of a wider effort by the Moldovan government to modernise and expand its economy ahead of a bid to join the European Union in 2030.",
      "This drive is being led by Moldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu, who this week was re-elected for a second term. And last month Moldovans voted \"yes\" on pro-EU constitutional changes.",
      "However, the vote was extremely close, with Yes getting 50.46% and No receiving 49.54%. Although Russia denied interfering in the vote, Moldova\u2019s authorities said attempts had been made to buy up to 300,000 votes in what Maia Sandu described as an \"unprecedented assault on freedom and democracy\".",
      "Moscow is opposed to Moldova joining the EU, and supports Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria economically, politically and militarily.",
      "Dumitru Alaiba, Moldova's deputy prime minister and minister for economic development and digitalisation, is positive about where Moldova is heading.",
      "\"Moldova in the past 10 to 15 years has really proven that it's a country that can change very fast,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This used to be a highly corrupt country, a country where, exactly 10 years ago, a billion dollars from our central banks just disappeared.\"",
      "\"We are moving very fast towards joining the EU, and we are reforming our economy at top speed. Of course, we have a long way to go.\"",
      "He pointed to Moldova's rise on the global Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International.",
      "Out of 180 countries - with a lower placing meaning that a country is less corrupt - Moldova is now in 76th place, up from 91st a year earlier.",
      "\"Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.\"",
      "Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.",
      "\"Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.",
      "\"It was painful intersecting with the tax agency. The banks were rough to work with.\"",
      "Member companies of the MITP don't just benefit from the 7% corporation tax rate. They also don't need to make employer social security contributions, and staff don't have to pay income tax. Mr Volks signed up DevelopmentAid almost immediately.",
      "The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.",
      "More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.",
      "In the first half of 2024, MITP firms generated a combined \u20ac365m ($397m; \u00a3308m) in revenues, according to official figures. And now employing 22,000 people in general, they are said to contribute around 6% of the country's GDP.",
      "While the MITP scheme has worked to boost Moldova's IT sector, the influx of foreign tech companies has driven up salaries in the industry considerably.",
      "Sven Wiese, a German expat who has set up a small IT services business in the country called Trabia, says he is now finding himself priced out when it comes to employee pay.",
      "He says that the biggest firms signed up to the MITP can offer IT specialists more than \u20ac100,000 a year, \"because that is still cheaper than hiring people within a bigger country like the US or Germany\".",
      "At the same time he says that many Moldovan IT sector workers still want to leave the country. \"Fewer people are now leaving Moldova, but emigration is still high.\"",
      "Another negative issue is the continuing war in neighbouring Ukraine, which is likely making some Western IT firms think twice about investing in Moldova. Mr Alaiba says is confident that Moldova is safe \"as long as the free world is supporting Ukraine\".",
      "Marina Bzovii, MITP's administrator and an assistant professor at the Technical University of Moldova, already sees Moldova as a regional business hub. \"Moldova is connecting even Central Asia, countries like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who are culturally much further from Europe.",
      "\"However, Moldova understands both of the cultures. So it's the kind of business hub that Europe needs... and Chisinau is now really vibrant.\"",

    "summary": "A 17-year-old student was hailed as a genius, until it emerged she'd cheated.",
    "story": [
      "A 17-year-old girl in China hailed as a genius in a mathematics contest cheated, competition organisers have said - ending months of scepticism over her stellar results.",
      "Jiang Ping, a fashion design student from a rural town in Jiangsu province, made headlines in June when she came 12th in the qualifiers of an international maths contest run by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "She was the first finalist since the competition began in 2018 to have come from a lowly vocational school, Chinese media reported. The vast majority of the 800 finalists came from elite universities.",
      "Jiang's results turned her into an overnight sensation, and she was labelled a \"prodigy\" in the press and on social media.",
      "Under China's notoriously cut-throat education system, academic excellence is lauded. Many people online were encouraged by Jiang's results, seeing them as proof that students from vocational institutes could still excel academically.",
      "However, as doubt surrounding her abilities snowballed, competition organisers  said last Sunday that Jiang had violated competition rules in the preliminary round, by receiving help from her teacher, who was also a contestant himself.",
      "\u201cThis has exposed problems like inadequacies in the competition format and the lack of rigour in supervision. We sincerely apologise,\u201d organisers said in a statement.",
      "According to the final results announced on Sunday, neither Jiang nor her teacher was among 86 winners in the competition.",
      "The rise of a maths sensation",
      "The annual mathematics contest is open to contestants from institutions worldwide and hosted by Damo Academy, Alibaba\u2019s research institute.",
      "This year, Jiang, a student at Jiangsu Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, outperformed other finalists from some of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions \u2014 including Peking University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Oxford.",
      "She had chosen to study at the vocational school both because she was interested in fashion design, and because her sister and friends were there, said local media outlets.",
      "Jiang's results and unconventional educational background soon grabbed nationwide attention. Her story was featured in a video produced by Damo Academy and she was interviewed by news outlets across the country.",
      "\u201cLearning maths is bumpy, but every time I solve the problems I feel quite happy,\u201d she told the state-run People\u2019s Daily. \u201cNo matter what the future holds, I will keep learning.\u201d",
      "Jiang\u2019s teacher, Wang Runqiu, was also thrust into the spotlight, hailed as an educator who noticed and encouraged her passion for maths. Speaking to the media, he described her as an attentive student who had learnt advanced mathematics herself.",
      "\"I have encountered many setbacks in the process of learning maths,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I want to do everything I can to help my students and let them know that there are other possibilities in the future.\u201d",
      "But along with an outpouring of praise for Jiang and her teacher, the student\u2019s story also sparked a discussion about whether China\u2019s education system did enough to support gifted students in less academic pathways - especially those who may not have received similar recognition by their teachers.",
      "China's education system focuses much of its resources on those taking the \"Gaokao\" - the notoriously difficult exam that students need to take in order to get into university. Those in vocational schools had long faced restrictions in taking the gaokao and enrolling in regular universities, until an education reform in 2022 offered vocational school students an alternative university entrance exam.",
      "An earlier op-ed in state-news media outlet Xinhua said that Jiang's results \u201chint[ed] at an awkward truth: even youths as talented as her may be easily buried without good education credentials\u201d.",
      "'She was not the mastermind'",
      "But as Jiang\u2019s fame burgeoned, criticism and scepticism surrounding her skills also started to bubble.",
      "In June, dozens of other finalists published a joint letter they wrote to the competition organising committee demanding an investigation into Jiang. They also called for her answers to the preliminary test questions to be made public.",
      "The finalists alleged that Jiang had made \u201cseveral apparent writing mistakes\u201d in an online video and that she \u201cseemed unfamiliar with these mathematical expressions and symbols\u201d.",
      "While the preliminary round of the competition allowed participants to use programming software, the final round was a closed-book exam. The results of the finals, which were initially set to be released in August, were postponed for several months.",
      "When the results were finally made public on Sunday, Jiang was not among the 86 winners of the final round.",
      "Her school also confirmed in a statement on Sunday that Jiang had been helped by her teacher Wang, and that Wang had been given a warning and disqualified from teachers\u2019 awards for the year. The statement also called for leniency and protection for the teenager.",
      "Attempts by the BBC to contact Jiang's family were unsuccessful. A social media account once used by her mother is now defunct, and a phone number linked to her father has been deactivated. Multiple phone calls by the BBC to Jiang's school went unanswered, and a village official declined to discuss Jiang when contacted by the BBC.",
      "While Sunday\u2019s revelation unleashed a wave of criticism of Jiang and her teacher, many social media users also spoke up for the teenager, arguing the bigger responsibility lay with her school and teacher.",
      "\u201cJiang Ping is not innocent, that\u2019s without question. But who are the worst parties in this?\u201d reads a post on Weibo. \u201cThe adults brought this child along to do a bad deed, and let her suffer all the consequences.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven if the whole thing was faked, Jiang Ping was not the mastermind behind it,\u201d another wrote on Weibo. \u201cShe should not be burned at the stake.\u201d",

      "Logan later succeeded Lynam to front Champions League coverage on the station, before departing under what she described as a \"cloud\" when her job as a World Cup anchor was given to a male presenter instead.",
      "She swiftly joined the BBC in 2007 and has stood in for Lineker on Match of the Day, alongside covering the biggest sporting events, including the Six Nations, the Olympics, the men's and women's football World Cup and this summer's Euros.",
      "Logan has recently begun hosting live games shown on streaming service Amazon Prime, further boosting her Premier League credentials.",

      "Scott, another regular Match of the Day stand-in, broke through as one of the first mainstream female football pundits after retiring from the game in 2017.",
      "The former England and Arsenal midfielder became the first female analyst to be taken to a men's World Cup by the BBC when Russia hosted the tournament in 2018.",
      "Later that summer, she also debuted as Sky Sports' first woman football pundit.",
      "In 2021, she took over hosting duties for the BBC's Football Focus - replacing the departing Dan Walker on the weekend preview show.",
      "An ever-present broadcaster at men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments since, Scott wore a rainbow armband during England\u2019s first match of the Qatar World Cup - showing support for the LGBT community in a country where homosexuality remains illegal.",
      "The recipient of an MBE, she defended her London accent after ex-House of Lords member Digby Jones criticised her pronunciation.",
      "Kate Abdo",
      "Following a stint at TNT Sport, Kate Abdo has found her career transformed at the helm of CBS' Champions League coverage.",
      "She previously told GQ that the show's success relies on its uninhibited feel, calling it the \"locker room environment translated onto television\" - mirroring the personality-driven tone younger audiences are used to from online sports content.",
      "One of its pundit Micah Richards (see below) has separately described Abdo as the \"glue\" that keeps the controlled chaos of the show together; balancing frolics (such as being teased into revealing her first kiss) with genuine analysis from the panel.",
      "As young audiences increasingly turn their back on terrestrial TV, the BBC is under pressure to adapt - particularly as individual match highlights now appear on YouTube long before Match of the Day's 10:30pm time slot.",
      "There's no doubt the new-age formula has worked for CBS, but it is a far cry from the traditions of Match of the Day. Could it work on the BBC? And would Abdo want to risk jeopardising CBS' popular dynamic?",
      "Alan Shearer",
      "Alan Shearer, alongside Lineker, is one of England's all-time great goal-scorers. Despite retiring in 2006, he still holds the Premier League goal record and remains top scorer for Newcastle United.",
      "This pedigree helped him become a mainstay pundit on the BBC and Match of the Day. He also formed a strong trio with Lineker and Richards, first on the BBC's Match of the Day podcast and latterly The Rest is Football - produced independently on Lineker's hugely successful Goalhanger podcast company. These have allowed him to show off more of his personality.",
      "Now almost 20 years into his media career, Shearer is however yet to host a show - could that step up to becoming Match of the day anchor finally be on the horizon?",
      "Micah Richards",
      "The ex-Manchester City and England defender burst onto the footballing scene as a teenager, but, after an on-pitch career curtailed by a knee injury, Richards has blossomed as the ever-animated pundit with a mega-watt personality to boot.",
      "He embodies the modern take on the role, engaging viewers not only with analysis but also fun-loving camaraderie shared between analysts and presenter.",
      "His media career blossomed as a jovial foil to the tough-talking, former Manchester United captain Roy Keane on Sky Sports' Super Sunday.",
      "Similar roles have followed on Match of the Day and for CBS' Champions League coverage - where humorous off-script moments between presenter Abdo, Richards himself and Premier League legends Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry regularly trend on social media.",
      "Asking Richards to make the step up to presenting duties on a show as prestigious as Match of the Day would represent a risk from bosses, but certainly mark a fresh start and shift in tone.",
      "He also has the backing of Lineker, who, when discussing the speculation over his future on The Rest is Football, told Richards: \"I'd love to see you take over. I think you'd be brilliant in the chair.\"",
      "Colin Murray",
      "Beginning his career in music as a fun-loving, noughties upstart on BBC Radio 1, Colin Murray soon moved into sport broadcasting.",
      "The northern Irishman balanced hosting BBC Radio 5 Live's raucous sport comedy panel show Fighting Talk with anchoring European football on Channel 5, before moving to precede Mark Chapman in the hot seat on Match of the Day 2.",
      "But controversy later struck when Murray used Fighting Talk's 'Defend the Indefensible' segment to ask panellists whether they would be able to \"turn\" the sexuality of openly gay broadcaster Clare Balding. The BBC soon issued an apology. Within months Murray had left the BBC to join TalkSport radio.",
      "Murray has since expressed regret, admitting to The Guardian: \"The second I said it... I knew it was over the line\".",
      "In the years since, Murray has rehabilitated his BBC career, returning to present various shows on 5 Live and expanding to become the host of Channel 4's long-running word show, Countdown.",
      "A chance at the main Match of the Day role may end up a step too far, but Murray is certainly a tried, tested and trusted football anchor with appeal spanning all age groups.",
      "Dan Walker",
      "Prior to quitting the BBC for Channel 5 in 2022, Dan Walker shared his high-profile  BBC Breakfast presenting tole with 12 years as the host of Football Focus.",
      "Walker would offer bosses a clean cut image and a safe pair of hands were he to take the role, having previously also covered Olympics and football World Cups for the BBC. He has also recently covered games for Amazon Prime.",
      "But questions remain over Walker's own interest - he is on a bumper contract at Channel 5 and has persistently batted away suggestions of a return to the BBC.",
      "Laura Woods",
      "Laura Woods made her name on TalkSport, receiving plaudits for her relatable style as a host and interviewer.",
      "She has since stepped up to become lead presenter for TNT Sports' Champions League coverage, replacing Jake Humphrey when the channel rebranded from BT Sport last year.",
      "Woods also presents football on Amazon Prime and ITV - joining the latter for coverage of this summer's Euros.",
      "Earlier this summer she spoke of receiving \"numerous death threats\" online after commenting on an article questioning the eligibility of Olympic champion boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting.",
      "Woods fits the mould of Abdo and Richards in bringing a more personality-led style to her broadcasting.",
      "Jake Humphrey",
      "Humphrey is a vastly experienced sports broadcaster, with a catalogue of BBC experience to draw upon prior to his later career exploits.",
      "After an early career on BBC children's TV, by 2006 he had started working with BBC Sport, presenting Formula 1, Football Focus, Final Score and becoming the youngest ever host in Match of the Day's history.",
      "Since stepping back from BT Sport, Humphrey has focused on his successful High-Performance podcast, exploring the lives of high-achieving individuals. However, Humphrey remains a fan of Match of the Day, previously telling The Express he would \"never say never\" to hosting the \"legendary show\".",
      "Kelly Cates",
      "An experienced anchor across radio and TV, football is Cates' life-blood, quite literally - she is the daughter of Liverpool and Scotland legend Kenny Dalglish.",
      "The broadcaster has hosted BBC Radio 5 Live's 606 football phone-in and, more recently, the station's Football Daily podcast, in amongst numerous other roles at major tournaments.",
      "But she is best-known in front of the camera as part of the presenting roster for Sky Sports' Premier League coverage - including its flagship Super Sunday programme.",
      "Cates, like Logan, brings both pedigree and gender diversity - but it remains to be seen if she could be tempted away from Sky."

    "summary": "The BBC will lose one of its highest-profile presenters when he stops hosting Match of the Day.",
    "story": [
      "Gary Lineker, who will leave Match of the Day at the end of this season, BBC News understands, has been the steady hand who guided millions of fans through football's agonies and ecstasies.",
      "As host of the flagship show for 25 years, he is also one of the corporation's highest-profile presenters, earning \u00a31.3 million last year.",
      "His one-line pay-offs at the end of each show, summing up both the fans' mood and the match, may have looked seamless.",
      "But they were the result of years of honing his craft and presenting skills.",
      "As a former footballer of considerable pedigree - including England captain and striker, with 48 goals in 80 appearances - he famously never received a red or yellow card during his career.",
      "His ability to keep his cool on the pitch stood him in good stead for a career in live broadcasting when he retired as a player in 1994.",
      "Even while he was still at school, he had his sights set on sports journalism, deciding it would be his fall-back if football didn't work out.",
      "Clearly it did.",
      "Known for his ability to find gaps in the opposition's defence, and his \"poacher's instinct\" , Lineker was the 1986 World Cup Golden Boot winner, and the top goal-scorer in England three times, each with a different club: Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "But while his sports career was at its peak at the 1986 and 1990 World Cup finals, Lineker spent time with journalists staying in the same hotel as the England team.",
      "\"As early as my mid-20s, I knew which direction I wanted to go in when I retired from playing,\" he told the BBC in 2014.",
      "\"I would watch the newspaper guys write their opening paragraphs and sit with the radio journalists and talk to them about how they did their job.\"",
      "His ultimate aim was to end up as the presenter rather than a pundit.",
      "But he admitted his transition into radio and TV \"took a lot of work\".",
      "",
      "His early broadcasting attempts were \"fairly appalling\", he told the BBC's Media Show's Ros Atkins in 2021.",
      "Starting out on Radio 5 Live \"was all part of the learning process\", he said.",
      "\"I managed to stumble my way through it, and I learned from really good people alongside me who were incredibly helpful in the early days.\"",
      "Lineker built on that experience, writing all his own scripts and carving out a role for himself.",
      "Having watched ex-sports stars David Gower presenting the cricket and Sue Barker presenting the tennis, he questioned why it wasn't the same in football.",
      "\u201cI just thought, as a player who\u2019s played right at the top, if I could crack presenting it would give me a niche,\" he told BBC Radio 4 podcast Don't Tell Me the Score in 2019.",
      "\"It would give me an advantage over all the others.\"",
      "Meanwhile, his popularity as a footballer endured. In 1991, Arthur Smith and Chris England wrote a stage play called An Evening With Gary Lineker, about a couple trying to rekindle their marriage during the 1990 World Cup semi-final.",
      "Starring Caroline Quentin, Clive Owen, Paul Merton and Martin Clunes, it was filmed for TV in 1994 - with Lineker making a cameo appearance.",
      "He also began building his wider TV career, appearing as a team captain on BBC One's comedy panel show, They Think It's All Over, from 1995 to 2003.",
      "As a presenter, he got himself noticed when he stood in for Des Lynam on the Saturday afternoon sports show Grandstand, in 1997.",
      "By the mid-90s, Lineker was also appearing on Match of the Day as a pundit.",
      "This gave him a prime learning spot - right next to its experienced and slick host Lynam.",
      "\"Des was very helpful - I used to ask a lot of questions about the little things that he did, and picked up some of his nuances,\" the former footballer said.",
      "\"He told me to be brave occasionally with closing lines, and not to be afraid to try to be amusing.",
      "\"Again, the little pay-offs I sometimes make at the end of the show are something that came from him.\"",
      "By 1999, Lineker was hosting the show, and reaching audiences the BBC sometimes struggled to attract and retain.",
      "People would also tune in to see his chemistry with the show's pundits - including other former footballers such as Alan Shearer, Ian Wright, Micah Richards and Alan Hansen.",
      "Lineker's questions kept the analysis flowing, while he was always willing to share a joke and opinion of his own.",
      "He also memorably introduced the show in his pants in 2016, having pledged to \"do the first MOTD of next season in just my undies\" if his former club Leicester won the Premier League, which they did.",
      "Shearer and Wright couldn't keep straight faces.",
      "Their friendships often shone through. In June this year, Lineker and Shearer sent an emotional message of support to Hansen, after hearing the news that he was seriously ill in hospital.",
      "But despite his rapport with his colleagues, off-screen matters were not as straightforward.",
      "As one of the BBC's highest-paid presenters, regularly topping the list of the staff whose salaries are declared, he faced constant scrutiny.",
      "Lineker did not shy away from speaking out about his own views, particularly on social media, while simultaneously working for a broadcaster committed to impartiality.",
      "In March last year, he posted on X about the government's asylum policy - resulting in the BBC briefly suspending him.",
      "Shearer, Wright and other BBC sport presenters refused to appear on air, in protest at his absence.",
      "Match of the Day was reduced to a 20-minute edition minus its host, pundits and commentary - and the story made headline news for several days, with politicians and media commentators all weighing in on the issue.",
      "BBC director general Tim Davie subsequently apologised to licence fee payers for the disruption, calling it a \"difficult day\" for the corporation.",
      "Lineker was reinstated nine days later.",
      "The presenter later said the response to his tweet was \"silly - it shouldn't have been\".",
      "\"I love the BBC. I've been there for nearly 30 years but people make mistakes, they recognise that and they addressed it and in the end, thankfully, we're all back to work,\" he said.",
      "The headlines and dramas generated by his online views reinforced not only his high celebrity status - but also how keen the BBC was to hang on to him.",
      "The incident prompted a review of BBC social media guidelines. Last September, new rules were published for BBC flagship presenters, saying they should be allowed to express views on issues and policies, but stop short of political campaigning.",
      "Lineker said the recommendations were \"all very sensible\".",
      "By February this year, he said he was using X less often, saying the platform had become \"increasingly toxic\" under its new owner, Elon Musk.",
      "Despite this, he and the BBC are still parting company, and its flagship football show no longer has a host.",
      "Lineker has plenty of outside business interests, including the successful podcast production company he co-founded, called Goalhanger.",
      "It produces shows including The Rest Is History, The Rest Is Entertainment and The Rest Is Politics, which won the Champion prize at this year's Podcast Awards.",
      "But for the BBC, Lineker's departure comes hot on the heels of several scandals.",
      "Former Match of the Day and The One Show host Jermaine Jenas was sacked in August following complaints about workplace conduct.",
      "In September, the BBC apologised to Amanda Abbington and upheld some of her complaints against her 2023 Strictly dance partner Giovanni Pernice, while clearing him of the most serious allegations.",
      "In the same month, Mr Davie said he could not see disgraced ex-news presenter Huw Edwards working at the corporation again.",
      "Edwards was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, after he admitted charges of making indecent images of children.",

      "BBC Newsbeat caught up with series producer Eiji Aonuma and the game's directors, Tomomi Sano and Satoshi Terada, to find out about making the game and their reaction to its launch.",
      "A nervous reveal",
      "Echoes of Wisdom was a complete surprise when it was announced at the Nintendo Direct showcase in June.",
      "Fans were quick to realise the significance of a game starring the princess as the main character.",
      "But it also introduced a new play style for the series.",
      "Rather than being equipped with a sword and shield, as in previous Legend of Zelda games, the main character has the ability to copy items and enemies found during their quest.",
      "Known as echoes, these items can then be spawned or \"pasted\" into the world, allowing players to come up with solutions to obstacles and puzzles.",
      "You might stack beds and boxes to scale a wall, or unleash several enemies to attack one of the game's bosses.",
      "Series producer Aonuma acknowledges \"a lot of the focus of the topic of conversation was going to be on Zelda being the main protagonist\".",
      "But, he says, a bigger concern for him was \"whether or not the unique gameplay of the echoes was going to be conveyed properly and understood properly by the viewers\".",
      "It's a feeling shared by directors Terada and Sano.",

      "\"From the second time through I sort of realised that there's various ways and methods of overcoming these puzzles and overcoming the challenges,\" he says.",
      "Aonuma says experimenting with different methods helped him to change his experience.",
      "\"And so I think that realisation that you can do various things and there are various ways to overcome and solve these puzzles is sort of a turning point of whether you become used to using the echoes in the new game system.\"",

      "Recent Zelda games have given players much more room to be creative and test the limits of what they can do, with some sharing the results online.",
      "Last year's Tears of the Kingdom, for example, allowed players to build strange contraptions and led to memorable creations such as a giant robotic Godzilla.",
      "Terada says that the team spent a lot of time testing Echoes of Wisdom's various combinations, but even they were surprised once people got their hands on it.",
      "\"Seeing how players are using it, I was really amazed at people's imaginations,\" he says.",

      "Many players said the game's frame rate - which governs the smoothness of on-screen animations - was unstable.\ufeff",
      "Sano confirmed that Echoes of Wisdom uses a variable frame rate, and that the developers felt this was the \"best option\" available.",

      "Nintendo at 135: Key moments in gaming history",
      "By the end it's possible to have gathered a total of 127, and the main method of selecting them involves scrolling sideways through a very long row of icons.",
      "It can be filtered using options including most used and newest, but many still felt that it could have been more streamlined.",
      "Terada tells Newsbeat the developers wanted to encourage players to experiment.",

      "'Marvel-esque sequel'",

    "story": [
      "Salford University's Centenary Building, which won Britain's most prestigious architectural award when it was first built, is to be demolished.",
      "The building was the inaugural winner of the Stirling Prize in 1996, but has been vacant for the past eight years.",
      "Judges had once declared it Britain's best new building, saying it was \"a dynamic, modern and sophisticated exercise in steel, glass and concrete\".",
      "But the university says \"its ageing infrastructure means it no longer meets modern standards and requirements.\"",
      "\"It has now been vacant for a third of its built life. Careful consideration has been given to the history.... and the University of Salford, intends to demolish the building.\"",
      "Architect Stephen Hodder said he was \"disappointed\" and suggested the building could instead be adapted and re-used.",
      "\"I've tried not to be... emotionally attached to the building. But I think that with concerns about climate change and carbon, we should be going to great lengths to see how we can adapt existing buildings.\"",
      "The proposed demolition is part of Salford City Council's wider redevelopment plan for the area. No timeline has been announced yet.",
      "But the Twentieth Century Society has campaigned for the Centenary Building to be listed saying that it had been described in the Architect's Journal as \u201cthe best building to emerge from the new university building boom of recent years\u201d.",
      "Built for less than \u00a34 million and designed in less than 12 weeks, it was originally planned to house the School of Electrical Engineering but was changed during construction to the Faculty of Art and Design.",
      "The steel and glass \"internal street\" was praised by the architectural world, winning both the Stirling Prize and then a Civic Trust award in 1998.",
      "One of the features praised in 1996 was the decision to not install air conditioning.  The natural ventilation system and underfloor heating were seen as groundbreaking in environmental terms.",
      "However, former staff complained it was too hot in summer and too cold in winter.",
      "The lack of sound insulation was also a regular complaint. The sound of feet on the metal staircases reverberated around the building.",
      "The building has sat empty and unused for more than eight years. A proposal in 2018 for it to be converted into a primary school went nowhere.",
      "Mr Hodder says, 30 years on, much has been learned about about the technology of the building but suggests the issues \"can be addressed with environmental controls\".",
      "\"I guess we have to ask the question as to whether they are sufficiently grave as to warrant demolition? I would venture not.\""

    "summary": "The South Korean hit drama returns for a second season in December.",
    "story": [
      "When I ask the creator of the hit Korean drama Squid Game about reports that he was so stressed while shooting the first series he lost six teeth, he quickly corrects me. \u201cIt was eight or nine,\u201d he laughs.",
      "Hwang Dong-hyuk is speaking to me on set as he films the second series of his dystopian Netflix thriller, which sees hundreds of debt-laden contestants fight it out for a whopping cash prize, by playing a string of life-or-death children\u2019s games.",
      "But another series was not always on the cards. At one point, he swore against making one.",
      "Given the stress it has caused him, I ask what changed his mind.",
      "\u201cMoney,\u201d he answers, without hesitation.",
      "\u201cEven though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn\u2019t make much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t fully finish the story,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first series was Netflix\u2019s most successful show to date, thrusting South Korea and its home-grown television dramas into the spotlight. Its dark commentary on wealth inequality touched a nerve with audiences around the globe.",
      "But having killed off almost every character, Hwang has had to start from scratch, with a new cast and set of games, and this time audience expectations are sky high.",
      "\u201cThe stress I feel now is much greater,\u201d he says.",
      "Three years after the first series aired, Hwang is even more pessimistic about the state of the world.",
      "He points to current wars, climate change and a widening global wealth gap. Conflicts are no longer confined between the rich and poor, they are playing out intensely between different generations, genders and political camps, he says.",
      "\u201cNew lines are being drawn. We\u2019re in an era of us vs them. Who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong?\u201d",
      "As I toured the show\u2019s playful set, with its distinctive brightly-coloured staircase, I picked up a few clues as to how the director\u2019s despair will be reflected this time around.",
      "In this series, the previous winner, Gi-hun, re-enters the game on a quest to bring it down and save the latest round of contestants.",
      "According to Lee Jung-jae, who plays the leading character, he is \"more desperate and determined\u201d than before.",
      "The floor of the dormitory, where the contestants sleep at night, has been divided in two.",
      "One half is branded with a giant red neon X symbol, the other with a blue circle.",
      "Now, after every game, the players must pick a side, depending on whether they want to end the contest early and survive, or keep playing, in the knowledge all but one of them will die. The majority decision rules.",
      "This, I am told, will lead to more factionalism and fights.",
      "It is part of director Hwang\u2019s plan to expose the dangers of living in an increasingly tribal world. Forcing people to pick sides, he believes, is fuelling conflict.",
      "For all those who were captivated by the shocking storytelling of Squid Game, there were others who found it gratuitously violent and difficult to watch.",
      "But it is clear from talking to Hwang, that the violence is fully thought out. He is a man who thinks and cares deeply about the world and is motivated by a mounting unease.",
      "\u201cWhen making this series, I constantly asked myself \u2018do we humans have what it takes to steer the world off this downhill path?\u2019. Honestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says.",
      "While viewers of the second series might not get the answers to these big life questions, they can at least be comforted that some plot holes will be filled in \u2013 like why the game exists, and what is motivating the masked Front Man running it.",
      "\u201cPeople will see more of the Front Man\u2019s past, his story and his emotions,\u201d reveals the actor Lee Byung-hun, who plays the mysterious role.",
      "\u201cI don't think this will make viewers warm to him, but it may help them better understand his choices.\u201d",
      "As one of South Korea\u2019s most famous actors, Lee admits that having his face and eyes covered and his voice distorted throughout the first series, was \u201ca little bit dissatisfying\u201d.",
      "This series he has relished having scenes without a mask, in which he can fully express himself \u2013 a chance he nearly did not get.",
      "Hwang tried for 10 years to get Squid Game made, taking out large loans to support his family, before Netflix swooped in.",
      "They paid him a modest upfront amount, leaving him unable to cash in on the whopping \u00a3650m it is estimated to have made the platform.",
      "This explains the love-hate relationship South Korea\u2019s film and television creators currently have with international streaming platforms.",
      "Over the past few years, Netflix has stormed the Korean market with billions of dollars of investment, bringing the industry global recognition and love, but leaving creators feeling short-changed.",
      "They accuse the platform of forcing them to relinquish their copyright when they sign contracts \u2013 and with it, their claim to profit.",
      "This is a worldwide problem.",
      "In the past, creators could rely on getting a cut of box office sales or TV re-runs, but this model has not been adopted by streaming giants.",
      "The issue is compounded in South Korea, creators say, due to its outdated copyright law, which does not protect them.",
      "This summer, actors, writers, directors and producers teamed up to form a collective, to fight the system together.",
      "\u201cIn Korea, being a movie director is just a job title, it\u2019s not a way to earn a living,\u201d the vice-president of the Korean Film Directors Guild, Oh Ki-hwan, tells the audience at an event in Seoul.",
      "Some of his director friends, he says, work part-time in warehouses and as taxi drivers.",
      "Park Hae-young is a writer at the event. When Netflix bought her show, 'My Liberation Notes', it became a global hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been writing my whole life. So, to get global recognition when competing with creators from across the world, has been a joyful experience,\u201d she tells me.",
      "But Park says the current streaming model has left her reluctant to \u201cpour her all\u201d into her next series.",
      "\u201cUsually, I\u2019ll spend four or five years making a drama in the belief that, if it's successful, it could somewhat secure my future, that I'll get my fair share of compensation. Without that, what's the point of working so hard?\u201d",
      "She and other creators are pushing the South Korean government to change its copyright law to force production companies to share their profits.",
      "In a statement, the South Korean government told the BBC that while it recognised the compensation system needed to change, it was up to the industry to resolve the issue. A spokesperson for Netflix told us it offers \u201ccompetitive\u201d compensation, and guarantees creators \u201csolid compensation, regardless of the success or failure of their shows\u201d.",

      "Strictly Come Dancing contestant Chris McCausland has been praised for performing a dance imitating his experience with blindness.",
      "McCausland and his dance partner Dianne Buswell closed Saturday's show with their couple's choice to Instant Karma! (We All Shine On) by John Lennon.",
      "The performance saw the comedian place his hands over Buswell's eyes as the room faded to black. The lights came back up moments later to show him spinning Buswell around on his shoulders as pyrotechnics flared in the background.",
      "The pair received a score of 33 out of a possible 40 from the judges, with Craig Revel Horwood describing the \"poignant blackout moment\" as \"absolutely spectacular\".",
      "Head judge Shirley Ballas told McCausland - who is the BBC programme's first blind contestant - that he comes out every week \"with your heart on your sleeve, and you give us 100%\".",
      "In Sunday's edition of Strictly, McCausland said the feedback from people had been \"amazing and on social media everyone really loved what we did\".",
      "He said about the dance: \u201cIt was nice to be able to smile and enjoy ourselves, have some lifts in it, and a little bit of wow-factor.\"",
      "Shaun Hayward, a singer and dancer who is blind, has been keeping track of McCausland\u2019s progress on the show via the detailed audio captions that are available with the broadcast.",
      "Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Sunday, he praised Buswell for coaching McCausland \"brilliantly\".",
      "\"It's not only doing that with someone with sight loss, it's that individual - how do they think, how do they work - do they work in numbers, do they work in patterns?\"",
      "In his own dancing, Hayward says he is a patterns person, often playing out the routine with his hands on a table to grasp the broader picture of movement.",
      "\"But, it's like anything - the more you do it, you're connecting the dots,\" he said.",
      "McCausland's dance on Saturday night followed a performance in 2021 from actor Rose Ayling-Ellis who is deaf. Ayling-Ellis and her dance partner Giovanni Pernice paid tribute to the deaf community by dancing for a short while in complete silence.",
      "It won the former Eastenders star a Bafta for the best must-see TV moment.",
      "McCausland was registered blind after losing his sight to retinitis pigmentosa in his 20s and 30s.",
      "Before Strictly, he insisted he \"can't dance\", saying:  \"If anybody out there is thinking 'how the hell is he going to do that?' then rest assured that I am thinking exactly the same thing.\"",
      "Earlier this week, students at the Royal National College for the Blind, in Hereford, where McCausland studied, told the BBC he was defying expectations.",
      "One student said: \"Some people think that people that have visual impairments can't really do anything or can't do much with their life beside piano tuning.\"",
      "\"He's doing so well now, it's quite surreal but it's really good, especially for those who don't know anything about the eye,\" they added.",
      "Another student said it would be \"really cool if someone who is visually impaired like us\" won the competition.",

      "Nick Curtis was more cutting with his two star review in the Standard, saying Paddington in Peru \"misses the easy charm, the fluency and the icy sliver of jeopardy\" from the first two movies \"which had genuine cross-generational appeal\".",
      "He added the pacing felt \"ponderous and slow\".",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey was one of many critics to give Paddington in Peru a three-star rating, praising the addition of new characters portrayed by Hollywood heavyweights Olivia Colman and Antonio Banderas, calling them \"assets\" to the film, albeit not matching the previous \"scene-stealing\" from Hugh Grant.",
      "Nick de Semlyen also agreed, writing in Empire: \"Colman is perfect casting as sinister sister Reverend Mother, overseer of the Home For Retired Bears.",
      "\"Whether riffing on The Sound Of Music, strumming irritatingly on a guitar, or struggling to keep a phony smile plastered across her face, Colman is great fun, though a little underused. Antonio Banderas, meanwhile, goes full Kind Hearts And Coronets, playing not just a boat captain with a secret, but his many descendants.\"",
      "Speaking in an interview with BBC Radio 1, Whishaw, who has voiced the character of Paddington in all three movies, said \"I think they are beautiful films made with such care and love.",
      "\"A good film is a good film and they are hard to make, so I feel very proud of them and very proud to be associated in this way with this character.\"",
      "The director of the first two Paddington films, Paul King, has since moved on to new projects including Wonka, starring Timothee Chalamet, but he is credited with writing this latest story alongside Simon Farnaby and Mark Burton.",
      "Clarisse Loughrey gave the film three stars in the Independent, calling Paddington in Peru \"the worst in the franchise\" but praised the production design, which takes full advantage of moving the cast away from the cosy comforts of London, and making \"every interior look like an untouched escape room with secrets hidden under every trinket\".",
      "Leila Latif of Total Film gave Paddington in Peru four stars, saying \"despite the title, the film feels distinctly un-Peruvian\".",
      "She added: \"There are no Peruvian characters (unless you count the bears) and while the film alludes to the previous horrors of plundering Spanish colonizers in a surprisingly brutal montage, it's still an uneasy shift that there is more screen presence from people of colour in London than there is in South America.\"",

    "story": [
      "Is it legal to import Sir Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses in India?",
      "This question has been puzzling legal experts since the Delhi High Court suggested this week that the notification banning the novel\u2019s import - issued in 1988 - might no longer be valid, as the government couldn't locate it.",
      "The Satanic Verses, criticised by some Muslims as blasphemous, was banned in India shortly after its release, sparking protests worldwide. Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989, calling for Rushdie\u2019s assassination. This forced the Indian-born Booker Prize-winning author into hiding for nearly a decade.",
      "Although the book remains officially banned in India, some legal experts now believe it could be imported unless the government reaffirms the ban. Others, however, caution that practical obstacles may still exist.",
      "The ban on the book came under scrutiny after Sandipan Khan, a resident of West Bengal state, tried to buy the book but learnt that it was not published in India nor could it be imported.",
      "In 2017, he filed a Right to Information (RTI) request for the official notification banning the book\u2019s import, but was sent through a series of departments without finding it.",
      "In 2019, Khan took the matter to the Delhi High Court, arguing that the ban impacted his freedom to read.",
      "Over five years, government departments repeatedly failed to produce the notification, despite customs having similar records from as far back as 1968.",

      "\u201cHowever, the government may pass a fresh notification [banning the book's import],\u201d Mr Lokur added, since the court has not declared the ban to be unconstitutional, but only said that the notification is presumed to not exist.",
      "Mr Mukherjee argued that the book could now be imported \u201cas there is no legal impediment\u201d against the book.",

      "Senior lawyer Sanjay Hegde said the book could have been published in India if \u201csomeone was brave enough to print it\u201d as only its import was banned, not its publication.",
      "\u201cBut after all the brouhaha, nobody wanted to print it in India.\"",
      "In 2012, the government of Rajasthan state sought the arrest of four Indian authors - Hari Kunzru, Ruchir Joshi, Amitava Kumar and Jeet Thayil - after they downloaded a few passages from the Satanic Verses and read them out at a literary festival in the city.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:39 GMT",
    "summary": "Everything we learned on the red carpet and behind the scenes of the MTV Europe Music Awards.",
    "story": [
      "The MTV Awards came to Manchester for the first time in their 30-year history on Sunday night, but somehow didn't feel very Mancunian.",
      "There was no sign of Take That or Aitch, or Liam Gallagher - even though he won best rock star.",
      "Organisers made a few subtle nods to the city: The stage was framed in the black and yellow stripes of Factory Records, and New Order's Blue Monday pumped through the speakers every time nominees were announced.",
      "But the show took a more global perspective, highlighting acts from Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and America - including a predictable victory for Taylor Swift in the night's two biggest categories, best artist and video of the year.",
      "She only appeared by video, choosing instead to spend the night watching her boyfriend, American Football player Travis Kelce, lead the Kansas City Chiefs to victory against the Denver Broncos.",
      "But there were plenty of other stars at the show and on the red carpet. Here's some of the gossip we picked up along the way.",
      "1) Raye gave an update on her missing song books",
      "Two weeks ago, Raye told fans her second album had been delayed by thieves who stole her car and, with it, several notebooks full of lyrics and song ideas.",
      "On the red carpet, she confirmed the police hadn't been able to track them down, saying: \"I've just had to let it go.\"",
      "The singer said she couldn't recreate a lot of the ideas, because the act of writing them down freed her mind to work on other things.",
      "\"You let it go, because you think you can come back to it - and now there are so many ideas that are just gone. It's so sad.\"",
      "But the singer, who won best UK artist, maintained a positive outlook.",
      "\"Everything happens for a reason. I'll have to start again and maybe it's a blessing in disguise.\"",
      "2) Busta Rhymes revealed his unlikely comedy hero",
      "The decision to bring rap legend Busta Rhymes to Manchester to receive a global icon award wasn't as random as it sounded.",
      "Before he developed his rapid-fire rap delivery, an 11-year-old Rhymes spent two summers living with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe.",
      "\"I went to karate school, and we illegally went into nightclubs, to make a little money break-dancing,\" he told us.",
      "\"I remember Boy George was cool, Wham was cool,\" he continued.",
      "\"But our favourite was Benny Hill. Benny Hill is still our favourite to this day. I don't think anybody has as ever been as funny or as charismatic as Benny Hill.\"",
      "So, during those halcyon days of watching smutty comedy in Morecambe, did he ever think he'd be back, winning a lifetime achievement prize?",
      "\"You can never foresee something like that,\" he said. \"When we first got involved with hip-hop, we didn't do it for none of the accolades. We just did it because we loved it.",
      "\"But with that being said, tonight is a dream come true.\"",
      "To honour that moment, he gave a nine-minute acceptance speech thanking everyone from his mother to an art teacher he'd met backstage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty four years of professionally recording [and] this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels incredible.\"",
      "3) Olly Alexander had advice for next year's Eurovision contestant",
      "Olly Alexander played a pre-show party on Saturday night, and couldn't quite believe the reception for Dizzy - the song which earned him 18th place at this year's Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "\"That went down a lot better than it did in Eurovision,\" he laughed, shortly before Jedward invaded the stage and caused utter chaos.",
      "At the main ceremony, Alexander was there to award song of the year to Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso. But he also had a few words for anyone considering representing the UK at next year's contest.",
      "\"I would say to them, whoever it is, 'Call me, and we will have a serious conversation about it',\" he said with the haunted look of a man who has seen some things.",
      "4) Benson Boone has a new fan: Bez",
      "In addition to winning best new artist, US singer Benson Boone opened the ceremony with a spectacular performance that saw him suspended mid-air on a grand piano, before pulling off a spectacular front flip from a platform at the side of the stage.",
      "\"The insurance is always crazy,\" he laughed, \"but I love to perform.\"",
      "One person who couldn't believe his eyes was Happy Mondays star Bez, who accosted Boone during an interview with Rita Ora.",
      "\"I was so blown away by that performance, mate,\" he told the singer.",
      "\"When you came down on that shiny piano, I thought, 'Elton John is going to be so gutted.'\"",
      "5) Le Sserafim escaped to Manchester's Christmas market",
      "Manchester is home to the UK's biggest K-Pop shop and, on Sunday morning, the staff couldn't quite believe one of the genre's biggest girl bands had landed in their city.",
      "\"Le Sserafim were posting pictures from the Christmas market,\" one of them told me. \"That's only five minutes from here!\"",
      "The five-piece, who've been setting chart records over in the US, jetted in for their first-ever UK performance, a mash-up of Chasing Lightning and the 90s house banger Crazy.",
      "But they were more excited to be out on the town without being mobbed.",
      "\"It was so good, we had baklava!\" enthused singer Huh Yun-Jin; while her bandmate Sakura tucked into a portion of fish and chips.",
      "\"It was my first time,\" she said. \"I loved it.\"",
      "On stage at the EMAs, the band got one of the biggest screams of the night, despite being relatively unknown in the UK... for now.",
      "\"Coming to Europe is something that we've always dreamt of, so this is absolutely surreal,\" said Yun-Jin. \"We just want to make a good impression.\"",
      "Mission accomplished.",
      "6) Jedward spent two hours on the red carpet",
      "For absolutely no reason at all, Jedward went on a massive charm offensive for the international press.",
      "\"Oasis are back and Jedward are back!\" they declared, before racing over to baffled German and French journalists, while singing Stop Crying Your Heart Out.",
      "This went on for two deliriously brilliant hours, as the twins, who found fame on The X Factor 15 years ago, insisted that \"a lot of artists have been inspired by Jedward\".",
      "And, to be fair, they have proof. Mercury Prize nominee CMAT recently said the brothers had encouraged her to finish her second album, with a motivational voice message.",
      "\"You have to think about it, in life,\" explained John.",
      "\"Don't always think you're the main character. Reach out to other people. Serve that tennis ball and see what they do.\"",
      "\"It's always about keeping that spark alive,\" added Edward. \"We're like a support animal for all the artists.\"",
      "They were, to be honest, an absolute blast.",
      "7) The Liam Payne tribute was perfectly judged",
      "Liam Payne won 12 MTV EMAs during his time in One Direction, and later used the ceremony to launch his solo career, performing his global smash hit Strip That Down at the 2017 ceremony.",
      "It was only fitting that the event marked his death - but striking the right tone in the middle of a huge showbiz event is never easy.",
      "In the end, his friend and collaborator Rita Ora just spoke from the heart.",
      "\"There were so many ways that we were talking about honouring him,\" she said. \"But sometimes simply speaking is enough.\"",
      "Addressing the camera directly, she shared her memories of the 31-year-old, as her voice cracked.",
      "\"Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew,\" she said. \"He brought so much joy to every room he walked into. And he left such a mark on this world.\"",
      "It was sombre and restrained, yet powerfully emotional. Ora wasn't the only one crying.",
      "8) Tyla paid tribute to Aaliyah",
      "South African star Tyla, best known for her viral hit Water, clinched both the best R&B and best Afrobeats awards.",
      "The awards marked her continued ascent, after being named one of the BBC's Sounds of 2024 - but she made sure to honour her inspirations.",
      "On the red carpet, she rocked a vintage Roberto Cavalli dress with a turquoise blue zebra print.",
      "The exact same dress had previously been worn by US rapper Eve at the 2000 Soul Train Awards.",
      "And R&B legend Aaliyah wore a canary yellow version at the 2000 MTV Awards, where she won best female video for Try Again.",
      "The ceremony took place in September 2000, less than a year before Aaliyah's tragic death in an plane accident.",
      "The singer was just 22 at the time - the same age that Tyla is now."

    "title": "'A disabled South Park character from 24 years ago is getting me harassed today'",
    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 09:31:07 GMT",
    "summary": "I have felt the shadow of Timmy since childhood - but never imagined the name would be hurled at me by strangers in my 30s.",
    "story": [
      "I can feel the anger rising. How am I facing this abuse again after 20 years?",
      "My name is Alex. But increasingly young people shout \u201cTimmy\u201d at me in the street. This isn\u2019t mistaken identity - it\u2018s mockery because I use a wheelchair.",
      "I should ignore it, but this time, I react. I turn to see a group of young teenage boys smirking in front of me. \u201cI heard you,\u201d I tell them. \u201cI know exactly who Timmy is.\u201d",
      "I know this because although we do not share a name, I have felt the shadow of Timmy since childhood - never through choice.",
      "A disabled character from dark-humoured satire cartoon series South Park, he uses a wheelchair and can only shout his name, mainly loudly and uncontrollably.",
      "Growing up at the show\u2019s initial peak during the turn of the millennium, Timmy followed me through school corridors, classrooms and playgrounds - no matter my friends, sociability or relatively good grades.",
      "Now, in my 30s, he\u2019s back. For the third time in a year, this time heading to my local train station in my wheelchair, I hear the familiar, brutish drawl: \u201cTimmaaah.\u201d",
      "A laugh. A snigger. An assumption I either won\u2019t hear or be unable to understand.",
      "When I confront the group of boys, one feigns innocence, claiming he\u2019d been speaking to his friend.",
      "\u201cYou weren\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cI was watching the show before you were born.\u201d",
      "Initially I was baffled as to how this phenomenon had returned to a new young generation, 24 years after the character first appeared.",
      "The answer lies in social media, particularly TikTok, where hundreds of short user-edited clips of Timmy and audio of him saying his name are sparking the revival.",
      "TikTok users often take part in trends by using the audio of popular videos and overlaying it with their own clips.",
      "That\u2019s what many have done with Timmy, where the name is used as a punchline, or played on top of unrelated clips of wheelchair users, reinforcing harmful and dehumanising stereotypes.",
      "The irony is that the character Timmy is presented with warmth in South Park and given character depth by co-creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.",
      "An equal in the show\u2019s unflinching satire, his disability isn\u2019t necessarily the butt of the joke.",
      "Timmy is an accepted member of the class: he fails to complete homework, faces adversity and causes trouble with his disabled best friend Jimmy. His personality is conveyed through the different intonations in which he delivers his name.",
      "One episode, Timmy 2000, sees him win a battle of the bands as frontman for a metal group. The adult characters are shown to respond in an over-protective and condescending way - a striking criticism of the way society often treats disabled people.",
      "Nearly 20 years ago, a poll by Ouch! - the former name of the BBC\u2019s disability section - crowned Timmy as the most popular disabled TV character.",
      "Seattle Times\u2019 late disabled critic Jeff Shannon described Timmy as the most \u201cprogressive, provocative and socially relevant disability humour ever presented on American television\u201d.",
      "\u201cWithout telling viewers what to think, South Park challenges [the audience\u2019s] own fears and foibles regarding disability, and Timmy emerges triumphant,\u201d he wrote in 2005.",
      "In interviews Stone and Parker have spoken of how carefully and purposefully they integrated him into the show.",
      "But two decades later, the fact remains that on meeting Timmy, certainly at first glance, many find him outrageously offensive.",
      "Disability slurs: 'We can't keep being poked like a bear'",
      "Soap star condemns 'daily abuse and prejudice'",
      "Heartstopper: 'How Netflix show's eating disorder story helps me'",
      "South Park has always worked on multiple levels - offering outrageous forbidden shock value for schoolchildren while delivering crunching adult satire.",
      "None of this nuance is reflected in the TikTok trend, which reduces Timmy, and by extension wheelchair users and disability, to one-dimensional ridicule.",
      "This warped revival parallels the case of Joey Deacon, a man with cerebral palsy whose appearance on Blue Peter in the 1980s backfired to spark playground mockery, with kids shouting \u201cyou're a Joey!\u201d, and \u201cdo the Joey face\u201d.",
      "TikTok says its community guidelines strictly prohibit hate speech and content promoting discrimination, violence or harm based on disability.",
      "It removed the videos flagged by the BBC for violating this policy. But it didn\u2019t remove the Timmy sound used on several other videos - meaning it can be used again.",
      "TikTok didn\u2019t respond to a specific question about removing offensive audio.",
      "Ciaran O\u2019Connor, from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a think tank focusing on online hate, says that sounds are a \u201cblind spot in TikTok\u2019s content moderation practices\u201d.",
      "Even if a video with an \u201coriginal sound\u201d is removed by the platform, the audio usually isn\u2019t, he says.",
      "This makes it a common way of bypassing TikTok\u2019s content moderation guidelines - including for harassment and abuse.",
      "Bullying and trolling of disabled people is still common online. Three in 10 said they\u2019d experienced it in a survey of 4,000 disabled people carried out by charity Scope.",
      "My last experience of having the name hurled at me on the street shocked me not so much in the name-calling, but the absolute lack of contrition shown even when challenged.",
      "It mirrored an experience last year when teenagers, again taunting me, rode off shouting \u201cTimmy is going to run us over.\u201d",
      "Ross Hovey, a wheelchair user and Liverpool fan, recently posted on LinkedIn about a near-identical experience.",
      "He was heading to a Liverpool match with his 79-year-old father and care assistant when a group of young men shouted \"Timmy\" at him. When Ross challenged them with \u201cI heard you,\u201d they too tried to claim innocence.",
      "The abuse raises questions about what role platforms should take in providing context to young users.",
      "\u201cBrief, contextless clips and participatory trends are at the heart of TikTok\u2019s popularity,\u201d  says O\u2019Connor.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s normally good and positive and funny \u2026 but when these dynamics are being used to demean, mock or stigmatise others, it does raise the question of whether TikTok should be doing more to inform or educate users.\u201d",
      "Alison Kerry, head of communications at Scope, told the BBC \"these kinds of ableist trends are deeply harmful. They don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, so a social media trend can quickly turn into someone facing abuse in their everyday life.\u201d",
      "The real-world impact is certainly becoming more noticeable.",
      "Disabled TikTokers have been posting about their experiences, and a teacher recently wrote a Reddit thread titled \u201cGetting real sick of this Timmy trend\u201d, expressing frustration at students' lack of awareness.",
      "This is why I challenged the teens at the station - I felt a duty not only to my 12-year-old self, who once burst into tears feeling helpless at similar taunts, but also to disabled students today.",
      "I returned a second time when the boys called out \u201cTimmy\u201d again after I turned to leave.",
      "\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked forcefully. Silence. One of the group eventually apologised, admitting the behaviour was wrong.",
      "\u201cSpeak to your friends,\u201d I pleaded, sensing a glimmer of hope. \u201cMaybe then they\u2019ll listen.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 13:58:27 GMT",
    "summary": "The actress was the last surviving original cast member of BBC Radio 4 serial The Archers.",
    "story": [
      "June Spencer, who has died aged 105, was the last surviving original cast member of The Archers.",
      "For nearly 70 years, she played Peggy Woolley in the long-running radio drama: one of the best-loved matriarchs in British broadcasting.",
      "Spencer helped launch BBC Radio's \"everyday story of country folk\" on 1 January 1951. Clement Attlee was Prime Minister, and meat, cheese, sugar, and petrol were still being rationed after World War Two.",
      "As Peggy, she weathered the ups and downs of life in Ambridge, with plot lines including alcoholism, gambling, and dementia, until Spencer\u2019s retirement in 2022 at the age of 103.",
      "At the time, her colleagues paid tribute to an actor who never fluffed a line.",
      "\u201cI have rarely worked with such an inventive, focused and technically brilliant actor,\u201d said Jeremy Howe \u2013 the editor of the programme, \"or with such a lovely person\".",
      "The Archers radio star June Spencer dies aged 105",
      "June Rosalind Spencer was born on 14 June 1919, just six months after the end of World War One.",
      "Her acting career began at the age of three, when she was cast as King of the Land of Nod in a school play. When she heard the audience laugh, June knew it was the life for her.",
      "She went to Nottingham High School for Girls, which she found \u201cvery stark, grey and cold\u201d.",
      "She was forced to give up sport \u2013 her favourite lesson \u2013 when a doctor somehow misdiagnosed a heart condition.",
      "An only child, her father was a \u201csensible and supportive\u201d biscuit salesman, but her mother was another story.",
      "A \u201ccomplex woman\u201d, Mrs Spencer had once aspired to the stage herself, but \u2013 according to her daughter - \u201cjust gave up on life... and decided she was an invalid at the age of 40\u201d.",
      "June Spencer had little choice but to leave school to look after her mother \u2013 who eventually lived until she was 94.",
      "Miserably, mother and daughter sat together in a darkened room in case Mrs Spencer had \"an attack\".",
      "Her headmistress was angry, complaining that her former pupil was throwing her life away. \u201cI was frightened of her,\u201d June later recalled.",
      "\u201cShe told me, \u2018Of course, you can't expect to get anywhere without your School Certificate\u2019.",
      "\"I have thought of those words many times since, particularly when I received my OBE.\u201d",
      "In her teens, the aspiring actress enjoyed writing comic monologues - performing them as part of the after-dinner entertainment at local Masonic lodges.",
      "But with her heart set on the stage, her mother was obstructive: refusing to let her daughter sit the exams for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.",
      "\u201cI think my mother thought I would fall in with a bad lot,\u201d Spencer said. \"When I did finally get in [to the theatre] she said: 'Oh well, I suppose it was inevitable'.\"",
      "She joined a drama club, studied for a London Guildhall drama school certificate, and finally joined a local theatre company in 1942.",
      "The same year she married a \u201cfair-haired, blue-eyed boy with the cheekiest grin I\u2019d ever seen\u201d.",
      "She had first met Roger Brocksom when she was 17 years old, on holiday near Skegness \u2013 but he didn\u2019t have the money to buy her a ring.",
      "The wedding took place while he was on leave from the army; wartime shortages meant they had rice paper rather than icing on the cake.",
      "A series of small parts on BBC radio programmes followed, and \u2013 by the time her husband returned from the war \u2013 Spencer was finding regular work.",
      "Then came the moment that changed her life.",
      "The founder of The Archers, Godfrey Baseley, is said to have talked openly in meetings about who was going to be in his new programme \u2013 and news travelled fast.",
      "It reached a mystified June Spencer while she was getting lunch in the BBC canteen.",
      "\u201cA girl said to me, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to be in The Archers, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\" she recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Am I? What\u2019s The Archers?\u2019\u201d",
      "In 1950, there were a few pilot episodes and then the big launch on New Year\u2019s Day, 1951 \u2013 with June Spencer playing a heavily pregnant Peggy Archer.",
      "The series hoped to be a public service for farmers, with gentle storylines that brought urban listeners into rural surroundings \u2013 almost as if they were eavesdropping on farmers and their wives.",
      "To start with, Spencer had a 13-week contract and little idea that she was helping to create a unique slice of British life.",
      "The shows were then broadcast live, with producers creeping in and scribbling alterations on scripts, moments before she read them.",
      "But The Archers was an instant hit with the actors \u2013 despite never having their credits read out on air \u2013 in demand for local appearances.",
      "\"I remember going down to a gathering of all the Women's Institutes in Cornwall,\u201d June recalled, \u201cand I was mobbed. It was quite frightening.\"",
      "There was a brief break from the show when June and Roger adopted two children in the late 1950s. Thelma Rogers took over the part for a while, but soon returned to the theatre.",
      "On taking back the role, Spencer insisted she had little in common with Peggy, who rather lacked a sense of humour, but her on-air journey from young barmaid to grieving widow saw them both involved in some of the show's strongest storylines.",
      "Peggy\u2019s first husband, Jack Archer, succumbed to alcoholism, while her second husband Jack Woolley \u2013 with whom she hoped to enjoy a happy retirement - was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.",
      "The show\u2019s slow-moving plot lines meant each disease unfolded over years - as they do in real life. And both issues were close to June\u2019s heart.",
      "Around the time of her Golden Wedding anniversary, Spencer had noticed that Roger\u2019s memory \u201cwas playing him false\u201d and \u201cthen the repetitive questions started,\u201d she said.",
      "When Peggy Woolley\u2019s husband was given the same disease in The Archers, June was supportive and \u2013 with her experience of Roger\u2019s gradual disintegration \u2013 was often consulted by the scriptwriters.",
      "Roger passed away in 2001. Five years later, June saw her son David \u2013 a ballet dancer who had lost his career through injury - die of alcohol abuse. He was 55 years old.",
      "For Spencer, such things were not unusual occurrences of life imitating art. Her attitude was that every family experiences traumas and disasters, and drama helps them to deal with it.",
      "\u201cWe tackle difficult situations that come up in real life, and treat them without being sensational,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI think people appreciate that. When they have the same sort of problems, they hear how the Archers coped, and I think it helps them.\"",
      "June Spencer was made an OBE in 1991 and a CBE in Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Birthday Honours List in 2017.",
      "Interviewers who came to her home in rural Surrey were routinely charmed.",

      "Just over a year ago, Milena Sanchez suddenly left one of the UK's most successful podcasts in a split that seemed to shock everyone - even her co-hosts.",
      "For seven years, she'd built The Receipts alongside Audrey Indome and Tolani Shoneye, collecting more than 100,000 weekly listeners on the way.",
      "Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, Milena says quitting was a difficult decision but her mental health had deteriorated to a point where she couldn't carry on.",
      "\"It wasn't one I took lightly - even though it might have seemed like that,\" says Milena, 33.",
      "Audrey and Tolani said in January they were blindsided by Milena's decision to leave but Milena claimed it came after a rift that had lasted for years.",
      "There were also rumours - denied by the podcasters - that Milena was bullied and squeezed out of the group.",
      "\"Ultimately, I had to be true to who I was and remove myself from that space,\" Milena tells Newsbeat.",
      "The Receipts, which started in 2016 and signed a lucrative exclusive deal with Spotify in 2019, has about 100,000 weekly listeners on Spotify.",
      "\"Financially, I could've shut my mouth and stayed and collected the bag,\" says Milena.",
      "\"But for me, it's not about that. It meant more to me - my mental health, my integrity and who I am as a person, and to not sell something that wasn't true.",
      "\"It's not easy, and especially when I do have a daughter that depends on me.\"",
      "Milena says her daughter, who was just one year old when The Receipts started and is now almost 10, helped her find the courage to quit.",
      "\"I really had to sit down with myself and ask, if my daughter came to me with the same predicament, what would be my response to her?\" Milena says.",
      "\"My response wouldn't be to stay somewhere just because of money. It would just be, 'choose yourself'.",
      "\"You only live once and I know it sounds so clich\u00e9d, but you can't be stuck in a space where you just don't feel happy.\"",
      "Milena says her year since quitting The Receipts has been a \"whirlwind\".",
      "She says she left London to live in the countryside and pursue music and writing, but realised she was missing podcasting.",
      "\"There's been a lot of reflecting, a lot of self-analysing,\" says Milena.",
      "\"Ultimately I had to say to myself: I love speaking, my voice is very needed.\"",
      "'A one-man band'",
      "Milena says she had to overcome a lot of self-doubt before launching her own solo podcast.",
      "\"I was scared to put this podcast out.",
      "\"I felt like I'm just going to be in my home talking. It doesn't feel big enough, it doesn't feel glitzy enough.",
      "\"But it doesn't matter where it's coming from,\" Milena says she told herself.",
      "\"You started from from the ground before, so let's go again.\"",
      "Since she launched solo project Milena's Diary at the end of September, she says she's been \"overwhelmed\" by the response.",
      "\"It reminded me, 'this is why you are here. This is your purpose'.\"",
      "But \"it was very difficult to start again from the ground up,\" she says - and definitely a change of pace from The Receipts.",
      "There, \"I had a team,\" she says.",
      "\"We had production, we had social media people, somebody that edited the podcasts.",
      "\"All I had to do was turn up and talk and that's it.",
      "\"Now doing this solo, I'm doing everything myself. I'm a one-man band.\"",
      "Previously, she was one of three presenters bouncing off each other and not having that has been a \"hard\" transition.",
      "\"I really do enjoy being on episodes with other people because you do bounce back, there's other stories that are triggered in your mind and it's nice,\" she says.",
      "\"But I feel like having that time alone to self-reflect and to just talk is also very important.\"",
      "Milena says she uses her podcast \"as therapy\" and she feels more authentically herself than ever.",
      "She's also spent the past year releasing music leaning into her Colombian heritage and queer identity.",
      "\"My culture is so ingrained in me, even though I was born in London,\" she says.",
      "\"And I'm a queer woman so I'm going to talk on that openly and very proudly.\"",
      "Looking back on the past year, \"I feel so much happier,\" Milena says.",
      "\"I am in a space where I have done so much work on myself, so much self-reflection and taking accountability for things I don't think that I would've a couple of years back.",

      "We also know the pop star visited a friend's house in Argentina in the days before he died, again with Cassidy.",
      "But when Payne fell to his death, Cassidy had already left the country.",
      "What happened on the day he died?",
      "Payne had been staying in the upmarket Casa Sur hotel for three days before his death.",
      "A call was made to emergency services around 17:00 local time (21:00 BST) on 16 October by staff, with requests to respond to a hotel guest \"who is overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol\" and \"destroying his room\".",

      "He was pronounced dead at the scene, with the emergency services saying there had been \"no possibility of resuscitation\".",
      "What have official tests revealed?",
      "An autopsy, which was carried out that evening, established that Payne suffered \"multiple traumas\" and \"internal and external haemorrhaging\", with 25 injuries that were \"consistent with a fall from a great height\".",

      "They also ruled out self-harm or physical intervention by a third party.",
      "They said Payne didn't adopt a posture to protect himself from the fall. That, along with other information, led them to conclude he was unconscious or semi-conscious when he fell.",
      "They ruled out \"a conscious or voluntary act\", saying he didn't know what he was doing or didn't understand it.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:01:26 GMT",
    "summary": "People in England will be able to get free varenicline tablets to help them quit cigarettes.",
    "story": [
      "The NHS will start offering an \"improved\" stop smoking pill to tens of thousands of people in England who want to quit cigarettes.",
      "Varenicline, a daily tablet given over a few months, is as effective as vapes and more effective than nicotine replacement gum or patches, NHS England says.",
      "The drug, which fights cravings, was available a few years ago on the NHS under the brand name Champix but was withdrawn due to some impurities. The new version has been approved as safe.",
      "E-cigarettes, meanwhile, will \"sometimes\" be offered, often as a starter kit of about two weeks' worth of vapes by local NHS stop smoking services, officials said.",
      "Varenicline is a prescription only medicine, which means people cannot buy it over the counter at a pharmacy or supermarket and will instead need to see their GP or an NHS stop smoking service to get it.",
      "It works by reducing cravings for nicotine and blocking its effect on the brain, while also helping with withdrawal symptoms, such as feeling irritable or having difficulty sleeping.",
      "When used alongside behavioural support, such as counselling, it has been shown to help around one in four people to stop smoking for at least six months, said NHS England.",
      "That could help more than 85,000 people stop smoking each year, it said, and  might prevent around 9,500 smoking-related deaths over the next five years, according to research by University College London.",
      "Around one in eight adults\u00a0 - six million people in the UK\u00a0- are smokers.",
      "There were more than 400,000 hospital admissions in England linked to smoking last year.",
      "Each year the NHS spends around \u00a32.5bn on treating health issues caused by smoking \u2013 it is the leading cause of preventable illness and deaths.",
      "Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"The rollout of this pill can save the NHS millions of pounds, save appointments to help other patients be seen faster and save lives.\"",
      "What about vapes?",
      "Since e-cigarettes are not licensed as medicines, GPs are unable to prescribe vapes to people trying to quit smoking unless there is a locally agreed NHS scheme to do so.",
      "Some local authorities do offer vapes to smokers who are looking to quit.",
      "Guidelines recommend people try a licensed stop smoking medicine first, though vapes are a recognised smoking cessation aid.",
      "Vaping is nowhere near as harmful as smoking cigarettes.",
      "However, it is not entirely risk free and health experts agree people should not start vaping other than to give up smoking.",
      "Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said access to services was variable.",
      "She said: \"Wherever a smoker lives, they should be able to access the most effective forms of treatment to help them stop.",
      "\u201cImproving access to varenicline will be a positive step forward to help prevent the tens of thousands of deaths caused by smoking. However, a drug alone will not transform smoking rates. Services are needed to support smokers and prescribe these products.",
      "\"The NHS has done a good job in setting up in-hospital support to help people quit smoking, which complements the services provided in the community.",
      "\"But gaps remain around the country, with services often in peril as local NHS organisations try to balance the books.\"",
      "Prof Nick Hopkinson, professor of respiratory medicine at Imperial College London, said varenicline was the \"most effective smoking cessation medication\".",
      "The fact it has not been available for the last few years has been a \"real problem\", he said, adding: \"We know that quitting smoking is the best thing anyone who smokes can do to improve their health and the health of people around them, especially children and young people.",
      "\u201cPeople are most likely to quit successfully if they have a combination of counselling support and medication to relieve cravings and help break their tobacco dependence.\"",
      "He said people could access help online at NHS Smokefree and should ask their healthcare provider about varenicline, \"especially if they have not managed to quit successfully using other medications like nicotine patches or gum in the past\".",

      "Boris Johnson\u2019s government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said.",
      "Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.",
      "Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and \u201cbuild resilience\u201d going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said.",
      "The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress.",
      "Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid's impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK.",
      "Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021.",
      "In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020.",
      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",
      "In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals.",
      "That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",
      "Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m.",
      "The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave.",
      "In total, \u00a350.4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic.",
      "The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city.",
      "Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been \u201cuseful\u201d, as the sites had been envisaged as \u201cmilitary field hospitals\u201d at the time.",

    "summary": "NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard says the decision, in July 2020, was very disappointing.",
    "story": [
      "Boris Johnson\u2019s government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said.",
      "Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.",
      "Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and \u201cbuild resilience\u201d going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said.",
      "The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress.",
      "Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid's impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK.",
      "Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021.",
      "In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020.",
      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",
      "In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals.",
      "That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",
      "Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m.",
      "The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave.",
      "In total, \u00a350.4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic.",
      "The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city.",
      "Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been \u201cuseful\u201d, as the sites had been envisaged as \u201cmilitary field hospitals\u201d at the time.",
      "\u201cWe thought we were doing it to avoid a northern Italy situation,\u201d she said, referring to scenes in Lombardy, where intensive-care units had been overwhelmed.",

      "He added he would not comment on \"hypothetical scenarios\" of a future US administration.",

      "Top pub and restaurant bosses have warned the chancellor that tax rises in last month's Budget will \"unquestionably\" cause closures and job losses.",
      "In a letter, more than 200 signatories have said the hospitality industry is disproportionately impacted by an \"unsustainable\" hike in the amount employers pay in National Insurance contributions (NICs).",
      "It adds that businesses have \"no capacity to pass the costs onto customers\", which would instead lead to job cuts and closures of smaller firms.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said that her National Insurance changes for businesses will generate \u00a325bn, which would aid funding of public services, such as the NHS.",
      "From April, the rate employers pay in National Insurance will rise from 13.8% to 15%, and the threshold at which they start paying the tax on each employee's salary will be reduced from \u00a39,100 per year to \u00a35,000.",
      "Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the changes had been designed in a way \"that tried to limit the extra cost on small business\".",
      "Signatories of the letter include Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, the bosses of pub firms Fuller's and Stonegate Group, and Premier Inn's owner, Whitbread.",
      "They are supported by a further 209 businesses, together employing tens of thousands of people across the UK.",
      "According to the letter, the cost increases will cause jobs to be \"drastically\" cut and hours to be reduced for workers.",
      "Ms Nicholls told the BBC that firms in the industry facing these \"tough decisions\" may also reconsider investing.",
      "\"We understand that the government has a tough job to do,\" she said, but urged politicians to \"have a rethink\".",
      "Jones said that the government would not reassess the plan, and that many employers would pay the same in NI contributions as they do now, or less.",
      "\"I think the public would recognise that bigger businesses are able to burden some of the contributions that we need to make to the state.",
      "\"Getting the NHS back on its feet so workers who are off sick can get back to work is probably something that we'd say we'd all benefit from,\" he added.",
      "Impact on lower earners",
      "The letter from industry bosses suggests that changes in the NICs threshold are \"regressive in their impact on lower earners and will impact flexible working practices which many older workers and parents rely upon\".",
      "The signatories are calling for the government to consider one of two measures to \"protect businesses who employ low earners\"  to mitigate the impact.",
      "Suggested measures are a new employer NICs band which would apply between \u00a35,000 and \u00a39,100 at a lower rate of 5%, or implementing an exemption for taxpayers working fewer than 20 hours per week.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has calculated that three quarters of the impact of the NI changes will be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "During a select committee hearing on Tuesday, the OBR's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "The changes set out in the Budget are, however, predicted to raise some \u00a325bn a year, making it one of the biggest single tax-raising measures in history.",
      "The chancellor has previously said that she was not immune to \"criticism\" over the move, but has argued that it will put public finances on a \"firm footing\".",
      "The hospitality industry's letter follows on from big British supermarkets such as M&S and Sainsbury's hinting that they may put up prices in a bid to offset higher wage bills.",

    "title": "What's so wrong with Right To Buy?",
    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 07:43:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The Labour government is expected to make major changes to the Right To Buy scheme launched in the 1980s.",
    "story": [
      "When Harold Wilson was Labour prime minister in the late 1960s, up to a third of people in England lived in a council house or flat.",
      "But by the time Keir Starmer became prime minister in July this year, the proportion of people in England living in social housing had fallen to about 16% of the population \u2013 about four million.",
      "About two million council-built properties have been sold to their tenants at significantly discounted prices under the Right To Buy (RTB) scheme since it was introduced by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government in the early 1980s.",
      "Michael Heseltine described the advent of RTB as \"laying the foundations of one of the most important social revolutions of the century\", but was selling off council houses more cheaply than new ones could be built simply laying the foundations of a housing crisis?",
      "Waiting lists",
      "Historically, money raised from selling off council houses has not gone far towards building new ones - new ones desperately needed, considering about 1.3 million people are on waiting lists for them in England.",
      "Across the north-west of England, for example, about 4,350 council houses have been sold off in the last 10 years, with the money made from the sales going towards building or buying just over 1,400 others, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "While the \u00a3336,612,000 raised from those sales may sound a reasonable sum, it works out on average at about \u00a377,000 per house. And, generally, councils have not been allowed to keep the whole amount, instead having to hand a sizeable chunk back to the government.",
      "About 200,000 people are on waiting lists for social housing in the region.",
      "While housing associations may have built homes, and there may have been schemes funded by cash from other government pots, the fact that the money raised from selling off homes is nowhere near enough to rebuild or buy like-for-like has been a long-standing concern.",
      "And it would seem Labour deputy prime minister and minister for housing Angela Rayner \u2013 who famously bought her own council house in Stockport under RTB \u2013 has taken on board the views of RTB critics.",
      "Rayner has said recently she may impose restrictions so that people who move into newly built council houses will not be able to buy them in the future.",
      "It is a decision that is likely to be welcomed by Labour politicians in regions where the need for social housing is arguably as great as ever, but the amount of it available is very low.",
      "The Labour metro-mayors of both Liverpool and Manchester regions have both said they want to see more social housing built in their regions.",
      "In May, Andy Burnham, leader of Greater Manchester, called on the-then Conservative government to pause RTB on new builds after losing 500 social homes to the scheme in 2022.",
      "He argued that if planned homes could be bought by their tenants, it would be \"like trying to fill a bath without the plug in\".",
      "On Merseyside, virtually all former council housing stock was transferred to housing associations over the last two decades.",
      "But metro mayor Steve Rotheram says registered social landlords (RSLs) have inherited some of the problems that came with RTB.",
      "He says one Merseyside RSL had lost about a third of its homes through sales to tenants in the decade since the housing stock was transferred.",
      "People who are tenants of RSLs can buy their homes under \u201cpreserved\u201d RTB if they lived in their homes when the council owned them.",
      "And once someone has lived in an RSL property for three years, they can apply for the Right To Acquire.",
      "Rotheram says cheaper borrowing rates for RSLs and a moratorium on sales would help boost growth in social housing.",
      "\"You are not going to build a lot of houses for someone to come along in three or four years and buy it below market value,\" he says.",
      "\"How we deal with this is part of our growth plan going to the government, and we are now trying to see if we can work with [Rayner] to come up with proposals.\"",
      "Blackpool Council\u2019s cabinet member for economy and the built environment, Mark Smith, is clear that while the money generated from RTB sales is used to support various investments in housing, the RTB receipts his council receives are \"not sufficient to replace lost social rent housing\".",
      "And he says even with changes such as the government giving councils more flexibility to allow RTB receipts to be used alongside cash from other streams such as funds given by developers who get planning permission for private schemes, there is still some red tape in the way of using different types of funding together to build council housing.",
      "\"We do the best we can within the parameters of the policy as it exists currently but there is always room for improvement,\" he says.",
      "Under the new Labour government policies, councils and housing associations are being given \u201cmore freedom\u201d to decide how to use their RTB money.",
      "Previously, only 50% of the money a council received from a sale could go towards building or buying a new house.",
      "But in future councils will be able to use all that money, and put money received from private developers handed over as part of planning agreements into projects as well.",
      "These deals, known as Section 106 agreements, see developers give money to councils to mitigate any negative impacts their private schemes might have on local communities or housing markets.",
      "Sources within the social housing sector say that in the past the \"policy has never achieved anything like a one-for-one replacement ratio\".",
      "\"If it had then there would be a lot less concern about the policy,\" one says.",
      "\"Yes, a Right To Buy home continues to be a home after it\u2019s sold, but it contributes to a huge loss of social housing stock and contributes to housing waiting lists, or people having to live in unsuitable accommodation.\"",
      "'Serious shortage'",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, says there is a \"serious housing shortage in this country\" and \"record numbers of people living in temporary accommodation\".",
      "Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, says: \u201cWhile the Right To Buy can and has delivered home ownership for many the scheme in its current form does not work.",
      "\"Rising discounts, alongside other measures that restrict councils\u2019 use of Right To Buy receipts, mean that the money raised from the sale of property is usually not sufficient to cover the building costs of replacing the property.",
      "\"We have long called for the removal of rules and restrictions which disincentivise local authorities from building social homes, at risk of losing them.",
      "\"Councils must be given the control, power and flexibility to use receipt monies in a way that works best for their local areas, which includes retaining 100 per cent of the receipts permanently.\"",
      "'Scandal'",
      "In 2012, the Conservative-led government increased the discount a tenant could receive when buying their home.",
      "Since coming to power, Labour has said the discount will be reduced to between \u00a316,000 and \u00a338,000, depending on the location \u2013 a significant reduction from the \u00a3136,000 discount currently available in London and the discount of just over \u00a3100,000 elsewhere.",
      "Rayner, who bought her Stockport council house under a RTB discount in 2007 and sold it several years later for \u00a348,000 more than she paid for it, said she wanted to see a \u201cfairer\u201d system.",
      "Her department says it is a \"scandal\" that only about one third of homes lost to RTB have been replaced since 2012, and that it was \"working at pace to reverse the continued decline of social rented homes\".",
      "But while the government stresses there are \"no plans to abolish the RTB\", the \"social revolution\" Lord Heseltine heralded nearly 45 years ago is clearly facing a radical change to everything but its name.",

      "You\u2019re probably used to politicians telling you we\u2019re living in the most dangerous times for decades.",
      "But who\u2019s going to pay for our protection?",
      "Donald Trump is a lot less willing than the current president to pay for other countries\u2019 defence.",
      "As one UK source told me, \u201cit doesn\u2019t make sense for Europe\u2019s defence interests to be dependent on a few thousand votes in Pennsylvania.\u201d",
      "So Trump's return puts this question right to the top of the list.",
      "The UK government does plan, eventually, to hit the target the Conservatives committed to - of spending 2.5% of the size of the economy on defence, a level last hit back in 2010.",
      "But there\u2019s a defence review underway, and a spending review of every penny spent in Whitehall to get through first.",
      "They\u2019re expected to come one after the other, next spring.",
      "John Healey, the defence secretary, was granted an extra \u00a33bn in the Budget, which is a chunky sum of money - but in terms of defence spending, not a transformative amount of cash.",
      "And it\u2019s only a top-up for a year, with no certainty over long-term funding.",
      "A former minister said: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to order for the years ahead - how long can we be talking, when the need is now?\u201d",
      "The government will not say when they expect to hit the 2.5% target - and won\u2019t commit to hitting it before the end of the Parliament in 2029 - causing frustration in some quarters.",
      "A senior source said \u201cyou either believe it is the most dangerous time in decades and you fund it properly, or you just don\u2019t really believe it, so you don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "And earlier on the Today programme, former Defence Secretary Ben Wallace accused Labour of making an effective \u201ccut in our defence budget\u201d by including \u00a33bn of Ukraine funding in it.",
      "If Labour reach the 2.5% target, he said he\u2019d welcome it, \u201cbut it\u2019s got to be real money with a timetable\u201d.",
      "There is little disagreement that more resources are needed.",
      "John Healey himself has acknowledged the military \u201chave not been ready to fight\u201d. A squeeze on funding over many years had made money tight \u2013 the forces \u201chollowed out\u201d, according to Wallace.",
      "The UK\u2019s support for Ukraine, which has almost universal political support at home, has added to pressure.",

      "PM agrees with Army chief's warning of 'volatile' world",
      "UK must be ready to fight war in three years, says Army head",
      "According to the National Audit Office, the UK has committed nearly \u00a38 billion to Ukraine - air defence missiles, drones, cruise missiles, tanks and ships, as well as clothing and personal equipment.",
      "Another former minister told me that funding \u201cis absolutely urgent \u2013 it is urgent to help Ukraine but the most urgent is where our forces are in danger \u2013 it\u2019s not hypothetical, in the Red Sea the Houthis are firing at our ships.\u201d",
      "And shortly before the election, the government\u2019s new national security adviser Jonathan Powell wrote that a new administration would need to reinforce the UK\u2019s defence and security \u201cwithin the bounds allowed by a struggling economy\u201d.",
      "Some insiders argue rising threats around the world mean the UK should spend way more than 2.5% in any case.",
      "Another former minister told me, \u201cby any measure we are underspending \u2013 if you don\u2019t buy the insurance policy you end up having to pay yourself and the cost of real conflicts would be immense in comparison\u201d.",
      "A defence source told me, \u201cwe are going to have to make a move on spending or we can put our fingers in our ears and hope we get through it \u2013 the Treasury has to do the maths on this \u2013 the way to stop spending 5 percent of GDP in the future is to spend now.\u201d",
      "How it's spent",
      "But it\u2019s not just about how much money goes to defence - it\u2019s also about how it\u2019s spent.",
      "Recent history is littered with examples of Ministry of Defence projects that overrun and overspend, some in eye-watering proportions.",
      "One insider told me, \u201cthe worst thing we could do is spend more and spend it badly \u2026 the number needs to go up but we absolutely need to get a proper grip of procurement.\u201d",

      "One said the MoD had \u201cproved it can spend cash well but it needs to show it can do it consistently\u201d.",

      "A former minister said: \u201cforget your big new fantasy regiment \u2013 we can make what we have more lethal\u201d instead.",
      "The government says it wants to shake up and sort out the mess that defence procurement has become. But there is no doubt that is easier said than done.",
      "Power era",
      "While as a political party, Labour is instinctively uncomfortable with Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, when it comes to defence there is some sympathy with his attitude towards European defence funding.",

      "Another source told me, \u201cTrump set a challenge to Europe last time and he was in part right to,\u201d pointing out that after his term in office the number of Nato countries which hit the target of spending at least 2% of their GDP on defence did go up.",
      "Twenty-three now meet the 2% target, up from just six countries in 2021.",
      "Rather than worrying about what Trump might do in office, they said, \u201ca precondition for Trump to take European defence seriously is for Europe to take its own defence seriously.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to see how that does not mean more countries on the continent spending more of their own cash.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves, Nato does deter Russia, and we have to make sure that happens,\u201d said a defence source.",
      "America\u2019s role in our security is vital. But sources in government acknowledge that Europe, with conflict on its fringes, must play a vigorous financial part.",

      "There is instinctive political unease here with his behaviour, his attitude to the law, convention, and the truth. But perhaps in the words of one source \u201cit\u2019s not a rule of law era, it\u2019s a power era\u201d.",

    "summary": "David Lammy is on his first visit to the continent since he became foreign secretary.",
    "story": [
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy is coming to the end of his maiden tour of Africa with the aim of resetting relations with the 54-nation continent.",
      "\"Our new approach will deliver respectful partnerships that listen rather than tell, deliver long-term growth rather than short-term solutions and build a freer, safer, more prosperous continent,\" he said as he set out the agenda for his trip to the continent's two biggest powers - Nigeria and South Africa.",
      "Lammy's visit follows his appointment as foreign secretary in the Labour government that took office earlier this year.",
      "Since Labour was last in office in 2010, relations between African states and other world powers have changed massively.",
      "Today, China is the largest trade partner for many African countries, while Russia has increasingly made inroads, including by offering military support to West African states battling jihadists.",
      "Oil-rich Gulf nations, along with Turkey,  have also been increasing their influence on the continent by striking business and military deals.",
      "In contrast, UK-Africa relations have been \"a lot more lacklustre\", says Alex Vines, the head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "This is particularly the case between the UK and its  biggest trading partner on the continent, South Africa, and the trip is an \"attempt to reboot that\", he adds.",
      "\"I want to hear what our African partners need and foster relationships so that the UK and our friends and partners in Africa can grow together,\" Lammy said.",
      "Britain is no newcomer to the continent. A long \u2013 and at times chequered \u2013 history underpins many of its relationships with African countries.",
      "Almost all its former colonies on the continent are part of the Commonwealth, although countries that did not have this historical link to the UK have joined the group, including Rwanda, Togo and Gabon. Angola has also applied to join.",
      "\"The Commonwealth will likely continue to be a key platform,\" says Nicole Beardsworth, an academic at South Africa's Wits University.",
      "As its former colonies gained independence in the middle of the last century, Britain continued to play a sort of \"big brother\" role.",
      "But this is now changing.",
      "Dr Vines says Africa did not feature significantly in a major document released last year to outline the UK's priorities on the global stage.",
      "\"There were name checks to countries like Nigeria and South Africa and Kenya in it, but there wasn't much written,\" he says.",
      "Dr Vines adds that he expects South Africa-UK relations to improve under Labour because of its historic ties with the anti-apartheid movement that fought white-minority rule.",
      "\"That comes from the anti-apartheid struggle and the solidarity that Labour and people that were the Labour movement provided for combating apartheid,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth, however, notes that former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May tried to bolster ties with Africa, but her efforts were \"scuppered\" after she resigned in 2019 following turmoil in the then governing party.",
      "The UK then had an unprecedented turnover of prime ministers who had to deal with domestic crises, the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, and the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"Africa fell off the radar,\" Dr Beardsworth says, adding that the exception was the controversial, and now-scrapped, deal to send some asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda.",
      "Being the world\u2019s youngest continent \u2013 with a median age of 19 \u2013 Africa presents opportunities for the future, the UK Foreign Office said.",
      "\"Africa has huge growth potential, with the continent on track to make up 25% of the world\u2019s population by 2050,\" read a statement from the office.",
      "With an ageing population in the UK - as with much of the developed world - Dr Vines says that the sharing of skills will increase.",
      "He adds that migration is an \"emotive and complicated issue\", but the UK and other Western nations should avoid \"cherry-picking the best and corroding African states from being successful themselves\".",
      "The UK Foreign Office said that \"growth is the core mission of this government and will underpin our relationships in Nigeria, South Africa and beyond\".",
      "That will mean \"more jobs and more opportunities for Brits and Africans alike,\" it added.",
      "The UK's Africa policy has long focused on development aid, but this has been slashed in recent years as the country faces its own economic crisis.",
      "Dr Vines says aid can be important to deal with humanitarian crises, climate shocks and to finance projects aimed at expanding the private sector in Africa, but he does not see the Labour government increasing funding.",
      "\"When you had a previous Labour government under Tony Blair, Britain saw itself as a global superpower for international development - that\u2019s no longer the case,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth says relations are expected to move towards being more economically focused, and \"much more mutually beneficial\".",
      "She says this could also see the normalisation of the UK's relations with Zimbabwe and Harare being welcomed back to the Commonwealth after relations broke down during the rule of the late Robert Mugabe.",
      "Differences over international affairs such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could also play out less in the public.",
      "South Africa\u2019s position on both conflicts has been at odds with much of the West.",
      "But South African analyst Yanga Molotana does not see this as a major problem.",
      "\"Two things can exist at the same time - I can still hold my position, I can still hold my views, and we can still have a mutually beneficial relationship without the moral pressure of you saying that I have to agree with everything that you say,\" she adds.",
      "Dr Vines agrees, saying he expects the UK to continue promoting multi-party democracy in Africa, but there will be \"less finger-wagging, and more quiet diplomacy\".",
      "\"The concern is probably going to be more regularly raised in private,\" he says.",

    "summary": "The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the sterile worlds scientists have long thought.",
    "story": [
      "The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the dead sterile worlds that scientists have long thought.",
      "Instead, they may have oceans, and the moons may even be capable of supporting life, scientists say.",
      "Much of what we know about them was gathered by Nasa\u2019s Voyager 2 spacecraft which visited nearly 40 years ago.",
      "But a new analysis shows that Voyager's visit coincided with a powerful solar storm, which led to a misleading idea of what the Uranian system is really like.",
      "Uranus is a beautiful, icy ringed world in the outer reaches of our solar system. It is among the coldest of all the planets. It is also tilted on its side compared to all the other worlds \u2013 as if it had been knocked over \u2013 making it arguably the weirdest.",
      "We got our first close-up look at it in 1986, when Voyager 2 flew past and sent back sensational pictures of the planet and its five major moons.",
      "But what amazed scientists even more was the data Voyager 2 sent back indicating that the Uranian system was even weirder than they thought.",
      "The measurements from the spacecraft\u2019s instruments indicated that the planets and moons were inactive, unlike the other moons in the outer solar system. They also showed that Uranus\u2019s protective magnetic field was strangely distorted. It was squashed and pushed away from the Sun.",
      "A planet\u2019s magnetic field traps any gases and other material coming off the planet and its moons. These might be from oceans or geological activity. Voyager 2 found none, suggesting that Uranus and its five largest moons were sterile and inactive.",
      "This came as an enormous surprise because it was unlike the solar system\u2019s other planets and their moons.",
      "But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day.",
      "The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field.",
      "So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London.",
      "\u201cThese results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans that below the surface that could be teeming with fish!\u201d.",
      "Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions. She said that she was delighted to hear about the new results, which have been published in the Journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\u201cThe results are fascinating, and I am really excited to see that there is potential for life in the Uranian system,\u201d she told BBC News.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m also so pleased that so much is being done with the Voyager data. It\u2019s amazing that scientists are looking back at the data we collected in 1986 and finding new results and new discoveries\u201d.",
      "Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as \u201cvery exciting\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt shows how important it is to look back at old data, because sometimes, hiding behind them is something new to be discovered, which can help us design the next generation of space exploration missions\u201d.",
      "Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research.",
      "It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years\u2019 time.",
      "According to Nasa\u2019s Dr Jamie Jasinski, whose idea it was to re-examine the Voyager 2 data, the mission will need to take his results into account when designing its instruments and planning the scientific survey.",
      "\u201cSome of the instruments for the future spacecraft are very much being designed with ideas from what we learned from Voyager 2 when it flew past the system when it was experiencing an abnormal event. So we need to rethink how exactly we are going to design the instruments on the new mission so that we can best capture the science we need to make discoveries\u201d.",
      "Nasa\u2019s Uranus probe is expected to arrive by 2045, which is when scientists hope to find out whether these far-flung icy moons, once thought of as being dead worlds, might have the possibility of being home to life."

    "story": [
      "Someone moved the UK's oldest satellite and there appears to be no record of exactly who, when or why.",
      "Launched in 1969, just a few months after humans first set foot on the Moon, Skynet-1A was put high above Africa's east coast to relay communications for British forces.",
      "When the spacecraft ceased working a few years later, gravity might have been expected to pull it even further to the east, out over the Indian Ocean.",
      "But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles (36,000km) above the Americas.",
      "Orbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location.",
      "Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards. The question is who that was and with what authority and purpose?",
      "It's intriguing that key information about a once vital national security asset can just evaporate. But, fascination aside, you might also reasonably ask why it still matters. After all, we're talking about some discarded space junk from 50 years ago.",
      "\"It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,\" says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves.",
      "\"It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis.",
      "\"Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it,\" he explains.",
      "Dr Eves has looked through old satellite catalogues, the National Archives and spoken to satellite experts worldwide, but he can find no clues to the end-of-life behaviour of Britain's oldest spacecraft.",
      "It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name \"Skynet\" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise.",
      "But there's no connection other than the name and, in any case, real life is always more prosaic.",

      "How do we solve the problem of space debris?",
      "What we do know is that Skynet-1A was manufactured in the US by the now defunct Philco Ford aerospace company and put in space by a US Air Force Delta rocket.",
      "\"The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore. However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,\" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation.",
      "This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire.",
      "\"The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,\" the long-retired engineer told me.",
      "\"In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I'm afraid I can't remember,\" says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.",
      "Rachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has also been scouring the National Archives.",
      "Her readings have led her to one very reasonable possibility.",
      "\"A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?\u201d Ms Hill speculated.",
      "The official, though incomplete, logs of Skynet-1A\u2019s status suggest final commanding was left in the hands of the Americans when Oakhanger lost sight of the satellite in June 1977.",
      "But however Skynet-1A then got shifted to its present position, it was ultimately allowed to die in an awkward place when really it should have been put in an \"orbital graveyard\".",
      "This refers to a region even higher in the sky where old space junk runs zero risk of running into active telecommunications satellites.",
      "Graveyarding is now standard practice, but back in the 1970s no-one gave much thought to space sustainability.",
      "Attitudes have since changed because the space domain is getting congested.",
      "At 105 degrees West longitude, an active satellite might see a piece of junk come within 50km of its position up to four times a day.",
      "That might sound like they\u2019re nowhere near each other, but at the velocities these defunct objects move it\u2019s starting to get a little too close for comfort.",
      "The Ministry of Defence said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK's National Space Operations Centre. Other satellite operators are informed if there's likely to be a particularly close conjunction, in case they need to take evasive action.",
      "Ultimately, though, the British government may have to think about removing the old satellite to a safer location.",
      "Technologies are being developed to grab junk left in space.",
      "Already, the UK Space Agency is funding efforts to do this at lower altitudes, and the Americans and the Chinese have shown it's possible to snare ageing hardware even in the kind of high orbit occupied by Skynet-1A.",

      "He said this company was interested in sponsoring the COP29 summit but wanted to discuss investment opportunities in Azerbaijan's state energy firm, Socar, in return. An online meeting with Soltanov was arranged.",
      "During the meeting, Soltanov told the potential sponsor that the aim of the conference was \"solving the climate crisis\" and \"transitioning away from hydrocarbons in a just, orderly and equitable manner\".",
      "Anyone, he said, including oil and gas companies, \"could come with solutions\" because Azerbaijan\u2019s \"doors are open\".",

      "Initially, Soltanov suggested the potential sponsor might be interested in investing in some of the \"green transitioning projects\" Socar was involved in - but then spoke of opportunities related to Azerbaijan's plans to increase gas production, including new pipeline infrastructure.",
      "\"There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established,\" Soltanov says on the recording. \"Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.\"",
      "Soltanov then described natural gas as a \"transitional fuel\", adding: \"We will have a certain amount of oil and natural gas being produced, perhaps forever.\"",
      "The UN climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges there will be a role for some oil and gas up to 2050 and beyond. However, it has been very clear that \"developing\u2026 new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C\".",

      "It is now \"virtually certain\" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record, according to projections by the European climate service.",
      "Global average temperatures across the year are on track to end up more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which would make 2024 the first calendar year to breach this symbolic mark.",
      "These high temperatures are mainly down to human-caused climate change, with smaller contributions from natural factors such as the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",
      "Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.",
      "Many scientists expect the opposite, cooler phase, La Ni\u00f1a, to develop soon. This should, in theory, lead to a temporary drop in global temperatures next year, although exactly how this will play out is uncertain.",
      "\"We will watch with interest what happens going into 2025 and beyond,\" says Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.",
      "But, with levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still rising quickly, scientists warn it is likely only a matter of time before new records are set.",
      "\"The warmer temperatures [are making] storms more intense, heatwaves hotter and heavy rainfall more extreme, with clearly seen consequences for people all around the world,\" says Prof Hawkins.",
      "\"Stabilising global temperatures by reaching net zero emissions is the only way to stop adding to the costs of these disasters.\"",

      "Back then, he announced the US would pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the most important UN process to tackle climate change.  The agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.",
      "But the shock of Trump's decision was limited. The treaty's rules meant the US was not able to withdraw until November 2020, a few months before he left office.",
      "If Trump withdraws again, he will only have to wait a year before the US is completely out. That would give him three years to chart his own course without any need to report to the UN or be bound by its rules.",

      "\"They can't commit to anything and that means that countries like China will not want to commit to anything.\"",
      "In recent years, richer countries such as the US, UK and EU states have tried to increase the funds available for developing countries to cope with climate change. But they also insist that big developing economies also contribute.",
      "\"The US basically wanted to have China cough up some money for that fund as well. Now they won't be able to do that. That leaves China off the hook,\" Prof Klein said.",
      "Climate scientists say developing countries need billions of dollars of extra investment to become net zero, where they are not contributing to climate change, and stave off the effects of rising temperatures.",
      "While the US might leave the Paris Agreement quite quickly, Trump would still be bound by other global efforts to fight climate change.",
      "There have been reports that some of his supporters also want to turn their backs on these as well. Some have argued for a complete break from UN efforts on climate change, urging the president-elect to leave something called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that underpins global collective action to tackle climate change.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 12:05:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The Northern Taurids are at their peak on 11-12 November - but will the clouds part to let us see them?",
    "story": [
      "Shooting stars may be spotted tonight as the Northern Taurid meteor shower peaks",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Sky watchers will be looking out for the Northern Taurids meteor shower which will peak overnight on Monday (11-12 November).",
      "The meteors can be seen from virtually anywhere on Earth but sightings will be affected by the phase of the Moon and the weather conditions.",
      "These showers, known for their slow-moving, long-lasting meteors, are linked to Comet Encke.",
      "There are two streams to the Taurids with the Southern Taurids having peaked earlier in the month.",
      "What is the Taurid meteor shower?",
      "The Taurid meteor shower is caused by the debris - ice and dust - from Comet Encke as it passes through our solar system.",
      "Each time Encke returns to the inner solar system, its nucleus sheds ice and rock into space into a vast debris stream. When Earth passes through this debris the \"comet crumbs\" heat up as they enter our atmosphere and burn up in bright bursts of light.",
      "Taurid meteors tend to be larger than other meteors and can survive for longer periods as they pass through Earth's atmosphere. They also travel relatively slowly, crossing the sky at about 17 miles (27km) per second. This is about half the speed of the Perseids.",
      "A recent theory as to why Encke has such a large debris stream is that it was once part of a larger comet that broke up about 20,000 years ago. It has the shortest orbital period of any known comet within our solar system, taking just 3.3 years to orbit the Sun.",
      "When is the peak?",
      "Encke's debris stream is so large and spread out that it takes Earth a rather long time to pass through it. This is why we experience two separate parts to the shower - the Southern Taurids and the Northern Taurids.",
      "The Southern Taurids run from about 23 September to 12 November and peaked earlier this month. Northern Taurids stem from a nearby but slightly different stream and are active from about 13 October to 2 December, peaking around 11-12 November.",
      "The Taurids are not very prolific, tending to produce only five meteors per hour but they can be very bright. The showers sometimes produce fireballs \u2013 a perfect target for astrophotography.",
      "There seems to be a seven-year cycle with these fireballs. There were lots of sightings of them in 2022 and the next best opportunity may be in 2029.",
      "How do I watch?",
      "You do not need any equipment such as telescopes or binoculars as the secret is to take in as much sky as possible and allow about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark.",
      "The best time to view is around midnight when the shower's radiant (the spot in the sky from which the meteors appear to emanate), the Taurus constellation, is high in the sky.",
      "To find Taurus, look for the constellation Orion and then peer to the north-east to find the red star Aldebaran, the star in the bull's eye. Shooting stars will be visible all over the night sky so move your gaze around the nearby constellations.",
      "Skies have been clearing over the past 24 hours, leading to improved viewing conditions.",
      "Will I be able to see them?",
      "Viewing the Taurids may be affected by the illumination of the Moon, which could obscure some of the fainter meteors. The Moon will be in a waxing gibbous phase \u2013 going from half moon to full moon.",
      "However, the weather is looking much more favourable for stargazing now. The recent blanket of cloud we have had for several weeks has moved off, leaving a clearer air mass and a much better view of the night sky.",
      "Fog patches may obscure the sky for some - especially across southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, north-west England and north Wales. Any fog will tend to sit in the valleys though, so head for higher ground in these regions to have a better chance of spotting some spectacular shooting stars.",
      "If you do miss this meteor shower you won't have long to wait until the next one, as the Leonid meteor shower is expected to peak next week on the morning of 18 November.",

      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",
      "\u201cThe industry as a whole don\u2019t appreciate the importance of good retrofit advice,\u201d he says.",
      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",
      "He suggests that neighbourhood-scale schemes, for example to provide solar power to a whole street, might make more sense and could include more people in one go.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:03:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Big mining firms are switching to driverless trucks and other autonomous equipment.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

    "story": [
      "Out of all of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters, Derrick Evans has a particular reason to be happy with November\u2019s election results \u2013 he hopes the president-elect will give him a pardon for participating in the 6 January riot at the US Capitol.",
      "\u201cA pardon will be life changing,\u201d said Evans, who was a member of the West Virginia legislature when he and at least 2,000 others stormed the Capitol in 2021. It was part of an effort to overturn the results of the US election, inspired by the false belief that it was Trump, not President Joe Biden, who had won.",
      "He reached an agreement with prosecutors which saw him plead guilty to civil disorder and spent three months in federal prison in 2022. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he would pardon the rioters, whom he has called \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d. But who exactly will be pardoned - and when - is still an open question.",

      "But he has stopped short of proposing a blanket pardon, at one point telling CNN: \"I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can't say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control.\"",
      "His campaign has previously said decisions would be made \u201con a case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House\u201d.",
      "Arrests still being made",

      "Some of those who have been given the longest sentences, such as Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, did not participate in the violence inside the building. Instead, they were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other felonies for organising the melee.",
      "Arrests are still being made. In an update issued last week, the FBI said it is still looking for nine suspects wanted for violent assaults on police officers.",
      "But with Trump - who still maintains, without evidence, that he was the winner of the 2020 election - coming back to the White House, the future of the investigation remains uncertain.",
      "Citing Justice Department sources, NBC News reported that officials are focusing on trying the \u201cmost egregious\u201d cases before Trump\u2019s inauguration on 20 January.",
      "Delayed hearings",
      "In the meantime, several Capitol riot defendants have asked for hearings to be delayed in anticipation of pardons.",
      "Among them are Christopher Carnell, a North Carolina man who was found guilty on several riot-related charges earlier in the year.  His lawyers asked for a hearing to be delayed last week because of possible \"clemency actions relevant to his case\u201d, but the request was turned down.",
      "Jonathanpeter Klein, who along with his brother Matthew pleaded guilty to several charges in July, asked for his sentencing hearing, scheduled for 15 November, to be delayed. That request too was turned down.",
      "Wendy Via, co-founder of the not-for-profit Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), said that there is already a sense of excitement amongst rioters and their supporters.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 04:59:18 GMT",
    "summary": "The apology comes after a report found 200,000 children and vulnerable adults were abused for decades.",
    "story": [
      "New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has formally apologised to victims of abuse in care homes, following an inquiry into one of the country's biggest abuse scandals.",
      "The historic apology, delivered in parliament, comes after a report found that 200,000 children and vulnerable adults had suffered abuse while in state and faith-based care between 1950 and 2019.",
      "Many of them included people from the M\u0101ori and Pacific communities and those with mental or physical disabilities.",
      "The government has since promised to reform the care system.",
      "\u201cI make this apology to all survivors on behalf of my own and previous governments,\" said Luxon on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt was horrific. It was heartbreaking. It was wrong. And it should never have happened,\u201d he added. \u201cFor many of you it changed the course of your life, and for that, the government must take responsibility.\u201d",
      "The inquiry, which Luxon described as the largest and most complex public inquiry ever held in New Zealand, took six years to complete and included interviews with more than 2,300 survivors of abuse in state and faith-based care institutions.",
      "The ensuing report documented a wide range of abuses including rape, sterilisation, and forced labour.",
      "It found that faith-based institutions often had higher rates of sexual abuse than state care; and civil and faith leaders fought to cover up abuse by moving abusers to other locations and denying culpability, with many victims dying before seeing justice.",
      "The findings were seen as vindication for those who found themselves facing down powerful officialdom, the state, and religious institutions - and often struggling to be believed.",
      "Almost one in three people in NZ care was abused",
      "Some survivors and advocates arrived in parliament Tuesday to hear the prime minister's apology, while hundreds of others tuned in through livestreams across the country. Luxon had earlier faced criticism for delivering the apology in parliament, as that meant many survivors could not hear from the prime minister directly.",
      "Survivors have argued that Luxon's apology rings hollow unless it is accompanied with proper plans for restitution.",
      "\"The effects of that trauma came through later on in life,\" Tupua Urlich, a M\u0101ori survivor who had given his testimony of abuse to the inquiry, told the BBC's Newsday programme. \"It's not just the physical abuse, it was the disconnection from my family, from my culture.\"",
      "\"Justice? No, not yet... These words are nothing unless they're followed by action, and the right kind of action that is informed by survivors.",
      "\"The government have proven that alone they're not trusted, nor capable, of providing the sort of change and service that we need.\"",
      "Details on a restitution scheme are not expected until early next year.",
      "Luxon said Tuesday that while the government works on a new financial redress mechanism for survivors, it would pump an additional NZ$32m ($19m, \u00a315m) into its current system.",
      "The inquiry had made over 100 recommendations, including public apologies from New Zealand authorities and religious leaders, as well as legislation mandating suspected abuse to be reported.",
      "Luxon said the government has either completed or is in the process of working on 28 of these recommendations, but did not give specific detail.",
      "A bill aimed at better protecting children in care had its first reading in parliament on Tuesday, after Luxon delivered the apology. The bill proposes, among other things, a ban on strip searches and greater restrictions on people working with young children.",
      "Luxon also announced a National Remembrance Day to be held on 12 November next year to mark the anniversary of Tuesday\u2019s apology.",
      "\u201cIt is on all of us to do all we can to ensure that abuse that should never have been accepted, no longer occurs,\" he said."

      "It took just three minutes for Joel Cauchi to fatally stab six people and injure 10 more during a rampage at a popular Sydney shopping centre, an inquest into the attack has been told.",
      "The New South Wales Coroner's Court heard on Tuesday that Cauchi, 40, was knife-obsessed and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but had come off his medication and was homeless at the time of the incident.",
      "The inquiry also heard that no alarm sounded inside the centre until after Cauchi had been shot dead by police.",
      "The incident on 13 April devastated Australia, where mass murder is rare, and prompted a national conversation about gendered violence.",
      "All up, 14 of the 17 people stabbed that day were female - including five of the six  who were killed, and a nine-month-old baby. The NSW police commissioner said at the time that it was \"obvious\" Cauchi had targeted women.",
      "Tuesday's hearing laid out the areas of focus for an extensive inquiry which is due to begin in full in April 2025. The investigation will look into possible security lapses and failings in the mental health systems in NSW and Queensland, Cauchi's home state.",
      "Speaking in court, Dr Peggy Dwyer SC, the counsel assisting the coroner, said Cauchi had been off his psychotropic medication since 2019, despite authorities being repeatedly warned of his deteriorating state. Cauchi had come \"to the attention\" of Queensland police several times, she said.",
      "In her statement, Dwyer also provided the first detailed timeline of how the violence actually unfolded in Bondi that day.",
      "She said that Cauchi - who had been sleeping rough in the suburb of Maroubra on the morning of the attack - entered Westfield shopping centre around 15.30 (local), and began stabbing people roughly three minutes later, after removing his knife in line at a bakery.",
      "His first victim was Dawn Singleton, 25, followed by 47-year-old Jade Young and 25-year-old Yixuan Cheng. He then attacked Ashlee Good, 38, from behind.",
      "Good - who has been described by her family as an \"all-round outstanding human\" - then saw Cauchi stabbing her nine-month-old baby girl in her pram, and was further wounded trying to save the child's life, the court heard.",
      "Faraz Tahir, a 30-year-old security guard, was stabbed next, alongside a colleague. Onlookers at the time said he died \"trying to save others\".",
      "Cauchi fatally stabbed Pikria Darchia, 55, before being shot dead by NSW Police Insp Amy Scott, who had been on duty close by. Between the moment Insp Scott arrived and the moment she killed Cauchi just over a minute had passed, the court heard.",
      "In total, the attack lasted for five minutes and 43 seconds - yet no alarm sounded during that time.",
      "\"It\u2019s presently unclear why it took so long for the alarm to sound,\" Dwyer said.",
      "Before opening the hearing, state coroner Teresa O\u2019Sullivan acknowledged the pain and loss the broader community was still feeling as a result of the violence.",
      "\"I offer my sincere condolences to the family and loved ones who are here in court today as well as those who can\u2019t be here in person,\" she told the court, according to the Guardian Australia.",

      "- 13% of the black vote in 2024 compared to Republican John McCain\u2019s 4% against Obama",

      "\u201cDemocrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face,\u201d Moulton told the New York Times. \u201cI have two little girls, I don\u2019t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I\u2019m supposed to be afraid to say that.\u201d",

      "Once that glue came unstuck, he said, the party was ripe for defeat.",

      "But 2024\u2019s results will provide plenty of fuel for Democratic angst in the days to come.",
      "The Harris campaign itself believes she lost to Trump because she was facing a restive public angry over the economic and social turbulence in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic.",

      "US President-elect Donald Trump has doubled down on his campaign promise of the mass deportation of illegal immigrants, saying the cost of doing so will not be a deterrent.",
      "In some of his first public remarks since winning the election, Trump said his priority upon taking office in January would be to make the border \u201cstrong and powerful\".",
      "\"It\u2019s not a question of a price tag. It\u2019s not - really, we have no choice,\" Trump told NBC News.",
      "But how would Trump\u2019s campaign pledge of mass deportations of migrants actually work and what are the hurdles he may face?",
      "What are the legal challenges?",
      "The latest figures from the Department of Homeland Security and Pew Research indicate that there are around 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US, a number that has remained relatively stable since 2005.",
      "Most are long-term residents - nearly four-fifths have been in the country for more than a decade.",
      "Immigrants who are in the country without legal status have the right to due process, including a court hearing before their removal. A drastic increase in deportations would likely entail a large expansion in the immigration court system, which has been beset by backlogs.",
      "Most immigrants already in the country enter into the deportation system not through encounters with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents but through local law enforcement.",
      "However, many of the country\u2019s largest cities and counties have passed laws restricting local police co-operation with Ice.",
      "Trump has pledged to take action against these \u201csanctuary cities\u201d, but America\u2019s patchwork of local, state and federal laws further complicates the picture.",

      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, or MPI, said that co-operation between Ice and local officials would be a \"critical\" aspect of any mass deportation programme.",
      "\"It's much easier for Ice to pick someone up from a jail if local law enforcement co-operates, instead of having to go look for them,\" she said.",
      "As an example, Ms Bush-Joseph pointed to an early August declaration from the sheriff's offices of Florida's Broward and Palm Beach counties, in which they said they would not deploy deputies to help any mass deportation plan.",
      "\"There are many others who would not co-operate with a Trump mass deportation plan,\" she said. \"That makes it so much harder.\"",
      "Any mass deportation programme is also likely to be almost immediately met with a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists.",
      "A 2022 Supreme Court ruling, however, means that courts cannot issue injunctions on immigration enforcement policies - meaning they would continue even as the challenges work their way through the legal system.",
      "But can it be done, logistically?",
      "If a US administration was able to legally move ahead with plans for mass deportations, authorities would still have to contend with enormous logistical challenges.",
      "During the Biden administration, deportation efforts have focused on migrants recently detained at the border. Migrants deported from further inland in the US, from areas not located near the border, are, overwhelmingly, those with criminal histories or deemed national security threats.",
      "Controversial raids on worksites that were carried out during the Trump administration were suspended in 2021.",
      "Deportations of people arrested in the US interior - as opposed to those at the border - have hovered at below 100,000 for a decade, after peaking at over 230,000 during the early years of the Obama administration.",
      "\"To raise that, in a single year, up to a million would require a massive infusion of resources that likely don't exist,\" Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council, told the BBC.",
      "For one, experts are doubtful that Ice's 20,000 agents and support personnel would be enough to find and track down even a fraction of the figures being touted by the Trump campaign.",
      "Mr Reichlin-Melnick added that the deportation process is long and complicated and only begins with the identification and arrest of an undocumented migrant.",
      "After that, detainees would need to be housed or placed on an \"alternative to detention\" programme before they are brought before an immigration judge, in a system with a years-long backlog.",
      "Only then are detainees removed from the US, a process that requires diplomatic co-operation from the receiving country.",
      "\"In each of those areas, Ice simply does not have the capacity to process millions of people,\" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said.",
      "Trump has said he would involve the National Guard or other US military forces to help with deportations.",
      "Historically, the US military's role in immigration matters has been limited to support functions at the US-Mexico border.",
      "Aside from the use of the military and \"using local law enforcement\", Trump has offered few specifics on how such a mass deportation plan could be carried out.",
      "In an interview with Time magazine earlier this year, the former president said only that he would \"not rule out\" building new migrant detention facilities, and that he would move to give police immunity from prosecution from \"the liberal groups or the progressive groups\".",
      "He added that there could also be incentives for state and local police departments to participate, and that those who do not \"won't partake in the riches\".",
      "\"We have to do this,\" he said. \"This is not a sustainable problem for our country.\"",
      "Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA - an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls - said that any deportation programme from the interior would only be effective if coupled with increased border enforcement.",
      "\"That has to be the priority. You're going to make very little progress in the interior if that's not the case,\" he said. \"That's what keeps people showing up.\"",
      "Additionally, Mr Ruark said that a crackdown on companies that hire undocumented migrants would also be necessary.",
      "\"They're coming for jobs,\" he said. \"And they're getting those jobs because interior enforcement has basically been dismantled.\"",
      "The financial and political costs",
      "Experts estimate that the total bill for one million or more deportations would run into tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars.",
      "The Ice budget for transportation and deportation in 2023 was $420m (\u00a3327m). In that year the agency deported slightly more than 140,000 people.",
      "Thousands of immigrants would be detained while awaiting court hearings or deportations, and the Trump campaign has envisioned building large encampments to house them all.",
      "The number of removal flights would also need to be dramatically expanded, possibly requiring military aircraft to augment current capacity.",
      "Just a small expansion in any of these areas could result in significant costs.",
      "\"Even a minor change is in the tens of millions, or hundreds of millions,\" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said. \"A significant change is in the tens or hundreds of millions.\"",
      "Those costs would be in addition to the expense of other border enforcement efforts that Trump has promised: continuing work on a southern US border wall, a naval blockade to prevent fentanyl entering the country, and moving thousands of troops to the border.",
      "Adam Isacson, a migration and border expert from the Washington Office on Latin America, said that \"nightmarish images\" of mass deportations could also cost a potential Trump administration politically from a public relations standpoint.",
      "\"Every community in the US would see people they know and love put on buses,\" Mr Isacson said.",
      "\"You'd have some very painful images on TV of crying children, and families,\" he added. \"All of that is incredibly bad press. It's family separation, but on steroids.\"",
      "Have mass deportations happened before?",
      "Under the four years of the previous Trump administration, around 1.5 million people were deported, both from the border and the US interior.",
      "The Biden administration - which had deported about 1.1 million people up to February 2024 - is on track to match that, statistics show.",
      "During the two terms of the Obama administration - when Mr Biden was vice-president - more than three million people were deported, leading some immigration reform advocates to dub Barack Obama the \"deporter-in-chief\".",
      "The only historical comparison to a mass deportation programme came in 1954, when as many as 1.3 million people were deported as part of Operation Wetback, named after a derogatory slur then commonly used against Mexican people.",
      "That figure is disputed by historians, however.",
      "The programme, under President Dwight Eisenhower, ran into considerable public opposition - partly because some US citizens were also deported - as well as a lack of funding. It was largely discontinued by 1955.",
      "Immigration experts say that the earlier operation's focus on Mexican nationals and lack of due process makes it incomparable to what a modern-day mass deportation programme would look like.",
      "\"Those [deported in the 1950s] were single, Mexican men,\" said MPI's Kathleen Bush-Joseph.",
      "\"Now, the vast majority of people coming between ports of entry are from places that are not Mexico, or even northern Central America. It makes it so much harder to return them,\" she added.",

(The government has always rejected such ratings, saying they are biased against India.)",
      "Senior lawyer Kamini Jaiswal says Justice Chandrachud\u2019s appointment had come at \u201ca crucial juncture as some of the last chief justices had left under a cloud of dark spots and the position had been denigrated with serious allegations\u201d.",
      "\u201cSo, we thought Justice Chandrachud would use his erudition and brilliant mind to do a lot of good for the citizens. But he has been disappointing,\u201d she said.",
      "Senior Supreme Court lawyer Chander Uday Singh says his record is \u201ca mixed bag\u201d.",
      "\u201cIn his judgments, he would lay down the law brilliantly which could be used as a precedent for future cases. But whenever the state was heavily invested in any issue, he failed to hold power to account, so the state got away with what they had set out of achieve.\u201d",
      "For instance, he points out that the court struck down a government scheme that allowed people to make anonymous donations to political parties, calling it unconstitutional and illegal. \u201cBut then he did not hold anyone accountable for the illegality.\u201d",
      "Similarly, when it came to a political crisis in the western state of Maharashtra or Delhi\u2019s power struggle with the federal government, his judgments tended to favour the government, he adds.",
      "\u201cThere was hope that through his judgments, he would set things right in a country that is under a strong majoritarian government. But he fell short.\u201d",
      "Several top lawyers have also criticised Justice Chandrachud for what he did as the \u201cmaster of the roster\u201d by failing to effectively prevent the prolonged incarceration of political prisoners - leading to the death of some of them without ever getting bail. This happened despite Justice Chandrachud saying that bail should be the norm and not the exception.",
      "And as he neared his retirement, Justice Chandrachud also made headlines for what he did not in the court, but outside.",
      "In September, there was uproar over a viral video that showed him praying at home with PM Modi during a Hindu religious festival.",
      "Ms Jaiswal said by publicising the photo, \u201ca message was being sent that the chief justice is close to the PM\u201d. Lawyers, former judges, opposition politicians and many citizens also criticised him saying \u201cthe presence of a politician at a private event erodes the perception of impartiality of the judiciary\u201d.",
      "Another burst of criticism greeted Justice Chandrachud\u2019s comment last month when he said he had asked God for a solution to the vexed Babri Mosque-Ram temple dispute. \u201cI sat before the deity and told him he needed to find a solution and he gave it to me,\u201d he said.",
      "The comment led to a firestorm of criticism, not entirely unexpected as the mosque-temple dispute has been one of the most contentious and religiously polarising issues in modern India.",
      "The mosque was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992. A five-judge bench, which included Justice Chandrachud, ruled in 2019 that the demolition was illegal, but still gave the disputed land to Hindus and a separate site for the mosque to be built. Earlier this year, PM Modi inaugurated a grand new temple at the site, fulfilling a longstanding promise by his party.",
      "So, no surprise then that Justice Chandrachud\u2019s comment, seen by many as religious, was extensively criticised.",
      "Retired high court judge Anjana Prakash told HW news that his comment was \u201cdramatic, filmy and laughable and it had brought down the level of judiciary\u201d.",
      "\u201cA judge has to decide cases on principles of law. Where does God come into a judgement? Besides, people have different gods. And if a justice from another faith had said this, would the reaction be the same?\u201d she asked.",
      "Justice Prakash and other critics wondered if he was cosying up to the government for a post-retirement assignment.",
      "In the days preceding his retirement, Justice Chandrachud addressed some of the criticism in interactions with the media.",
      "\u201cThe separation of powers doesn\u2019t mean antagonistic relations between the executive and the judiciary, it doesn\u2019t mean that they cannot meet,\u201d he said at an event by the Indian Express newspaper, adding that such meetings were not used \u201cto cut deals\u201d.",
      "\u201cThe ultimate proof of our good behaviour lies in the written word \u2013 in our judgements. Is it consistent with the constitution or not?\u201d",
      "Justice Chandrachud said his comment on seeking divine guidance was because \u201cI am a person of faith\u201d and \u201cto impute motives to judges is not right\u201d.",
      "He added that courts were facing pressure \u201cfrom lobbies and pressure groups\u201d and they would praise a decision critical of the government, but if he ruled in favour of the government, they questioned his independence.",
      "At his farewell on Friday, the outgoing chief justice said he was perhaps India\u2019s most trolled judge, but his \u201cshoulders are broad enough to accept all criticism\u201d.",
      "And at the weekend, he told Times of India that he believed he had \u201cleft the system better than I found it\u201d.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m retiring with a sense of satisfaction,\u201d he said.",

The crown prince has never forgiven or forgotten Biden saying that Saudi Arabia needed to be made a pariah for its attitude to human rights.",
      "Trump\u2019s record in office is a mixed one when it comes to the Middle East.",
      "On the one hand he pleased Israel and upset the Arab world by recognising Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital as well as Israel\u2019s annexation of the occupied Golan Heights. But he also secured the Abraham Accords in 2020 which saw the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco establish full diplomatic relations with Israel and Sudan agree to do so.",
      "Trump was, and is, hawkish on Iran.",
      "In 2018, he pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Calling it \u201cthe worst deal in history\u201d, he shared the views of many governments in the region that the deal, aimed at curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, failed to tackle Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme while enriching the Revolutionary Guards with money then used to fund proxy militias around the region.",
      "In 2020, to Iran\u2019s fury but to the satisfaction of many in the Gulf Arab states, Trump ordered the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Quds Force.",
      "But today\u2019s Middle East is not the same as the one when Trump left the White House.",
      "Israel is at war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and exchanged blows with both the Houthis in Yemen and their backers in Iran.",
      "Under the Biden administration US influence in the region is seen to have waned with a White House largely ineffective at restraining its close ally, Israel, as it wages war in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House is thought likely to give Israel a freer hand to strike targets in Iran - like oil and nuclear facilities - that the Biden administration said were off limits.",
      "\u201cHis staunch support for Israel and aggressive stance towards Iran\u2019s destabilising efforts made him a key ally in the region, and his return to power is expected to intensify efforts to limit Iran\u2019s influence,\u201d former Israeli intelligence officer Joshua Steinrich says.",
      "But something else has changed in the region.",
      "Brokered by China, Saudi Arabia and Iran have agreed to put aside their differences, ending seven years of hostility, characterised most visibly by the war in Yemen where the Saudi air force bombed Iran-backed Houthi rebels.",
      "On Sunday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s military chief flew to Tehran to meet his Iranian counterpart, with both countries now talking about deepening their co-operation on defence and security.",
      "Ever since Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolution in 1979, Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab neighbours in the region have viewed Iran as a major threat to their security. But the surprise 2019 drone strike on Saudi oil facilities, attributed to Iran-backed militants in Iraq, was an uncomfortable reminder to the Gulf Arab states as to just how vulnerable they were to attack by Iran.",

    "summary": "With swathes of South Sudan submerged, a whistleblower warns water sources are being polluted by oil.",
    "story": [
      "Herders scooping murky water from a small pond in grasslands in South Sudan are well aware of the dangers they face if they drink it.",
      "\"The water is dirty because this place has oil - it has chemicals in it,\" says their chief, Chilhok Puot.",
      "Nyatabah, a woman from this community raising cows in the heart of oil fields in Unity State, adds: \"If you drink it, it makes you pant and cough.",
      "\"We know it's bad water, but we don't have anywhere else, we're dying of thirst.\"",
      "A former oil engineer, David Bojo Leju, has told the BBC World service that flooding in the area is washing pollution into water sources.",
      "Large swathes of the state have been under water for several years after unprecedented flooding, which scientists say has been worsened by climate change.",
      "Mr Bojo Leju says the floods are a \"disaster\" and that pollution from mismanaged oil facilities is a \"silent killer\" spreading across the state.",
      "South Sudan is the world\u2019s youngest country and one of its poorest, with a government hugely dependent on oil revenue.",
      "Unity State, a major oil-producing state, has always experienced seasonal flooding. But in 2019, extreme rains brought a deluge that engulfed villages, grasslands and forests. Year after year of intense rainfall followed. The water built up, trapped on the clay soil.",
      "At the worst point in 2022, two-thirds of Unity State were submerged, according to the UN World Food Programme (WFP) - even now, it says about 40% is still under water.",
      "Mr Bojo Leju worked for eight years for the oil consortium Greater Pioneer Operating Company (GPOC), a joint venture between Malaysian, Indian and Chinese oil companies - with South Sudan\u2019s government owning 5%.",
      "After a major pipeline rupture five years ago, he started photographing and filming pools of oily water and heaps of blackened soil in locations in Unity State, including sites near Roriak, where the herders live.",
      "He says spills from oil wells and pipelines were \"a recurring situation\", and that he was involved in transporting contaminated soil away from roads, so it would not be seen.",
      "He tried to raise his concerns with company managers, but he says little was done and \"there was no treatment plan for soil\".",
      "Mr Bojo Leju also says \"produced water\" - water released from the ground when oil is extracted and often containing hydrocarbons and other pollutants - was not properly treated.",
      "There were reports of high oil content, above international standards, in the produced water \"every day in our morning meeting\", he says, \"and this water is injected back into the environment\".",
      "\"The question is where does water flow?\" he says.",
      "\"Up to the river, up to the water source where people drink, up to ponds where people catch fish.\"",
      "Mr Bojo Leju explains that \"some of the oil chemicals seeped down\" into the groundwater, where they will flow into boreholes.",
      "\"The water table is contaminated,\" he says.",
      "When intense rains began in 2019, earth dykes were put around some spilled oil \"but it was not enough to withstand the volume of water\", he adds.",
      "In Roriak, there is no data available about the quality of the water the herders drink, but they fear pollution is making their cattle sick.",
      "They say calves have been born without heads or without limbs.",
      "Unity State\u2019s agriculture minister blames the deaths of more than 100,000 cattle in the last two years on the floods combined with oil pollution.",
      "In a forest close to Roriak, a group of men and women chop down trees to make charcoal.",
      "They have walked for eight hours along dirt roads flanked by flood water to reach the forest.",
      "They say the only water they can find here is polluted.",
      "Even boiled \"it causes diarrhoea and abdominal pain\", says one woman, Nyakal.",
      "Another, Nyeda, wipes away tears, saying she needs the charcoal to sell, but is worried about her seven children, left with her mother for a week.",
      "\"She has nothing either,\" she says.",
      "Nyeda lives near the state capital, Bentiu, in a reed hut squeezed into a camp housing 140,000 people who have fled conflict or the floods. It is completely surrounded by flood water and protected only by earth dykes.",
      "There is some food aid, but many in the area survive by foraging for water lily roots and fish to supplement their rations.",
      "Safe water is scarce. Nyeda uses water from a borehole for washing and cooking, but needs money to buy drinking water.",
      "Health professionals and politicians in the area have told the BBC they fear pollution and the lack of clean water are taking a toll on human health.",
      "In a hospital in Bentiu, a mother has just given birth. Her new-born baby\u2019s nose and mouth are joined.",
      "\"They have no access to clean water,\" says Dr Samuel Puot, one of the doctors caring for the baby.",
      "\"They just drink from the river where water and oil are mixed. That might be the problem.\"",
      "He says there are \"many\" cases of children born with abnormalities, such as no limbs or a small head, in Bentiu and also Ruweng, an oil-producing area north of Unity State.",
      "They often die within days or months, he adds.",
      "Genetic testing can give clues about the causes of congenital abnormalities, but the hospital does not have the facilities, and results are often not conclusive.",
      "Dr Puot wants the government to keep a register of cases.",
      "As the data is not recorded systematically, it is not clear whether these anecdotal reports indicate an unusually high prevalence of congenital abnormalities.",
      "\"It is plausible that oil-related pollution could contribute to an increased risk of birth defects,\" says Dr Nicole Deziel, an environmental health specialist at Yale University.",
      "Environmental pollution is a risk factor for congenital abnormalities, alongside genetics, maternal age, infection and nutrition, she says.",
      "Some compounds released during the production of oil can affect foetal development, Dr Deziel adds.",
      "\"Anecdotal reports can serve as important indicators of environmental health problems,\" she says, but stresses that without systematic data collection, establishing evidence of a causal relationship is difficult.",
      "In 2014 and 2017, the German-based non-governmental organisation Sign of Hope carried out peer-reviewed studies close to other oil fields in Unity State.",
      "They found increased salinity and high concentrations of heavy metals in water nearer oil wells, as well as high concentrations of lead and barium in human hair samples.",
      "The researchers concluded these were indicators of pollution from oil production.",
      "You can watch South Sudan: Poisoned Floods on iPlayer (UK only) or on the BBC Africa YouTube channel (outside the UK)",
      "It begins the new season of the BBC World Service series Life at 50\u00b0C, which investigates climate change and the devastating effects of water insecurity in some of the hottest parts of the world.",
      "The government has commissioned an environmental audit of the impact of the oil industry, but the results are yet to be made public more than a year later than expected.",
      "Mary Ayen Majok, a senior politician from the ruling party, has been raising concerns about oil pollution for more than a decade.",
      "She is a member of the government and deputy speaker in the upper house of the South Sudanese parliament, and is from Ruweng.",
      "She says one of her own relatives has had a child \"born with deformities\" and believes many such cases are not reported because of fear of stigma or lack of access to medical facilities.",
      "Ms Majok says South Sudan \"inherited an industry that was based on bad practices\" when the country was formed in 2011 after it gained independence from Sudan.",
      "A five-year civil war broke out in 2013. For a nation facing conflict and heavily dependent on oil revenues, improving environmental responsibility has been \"at the tail of our priorities\", she says.",
      "Laws and institutions have been established but \"accountability is not that strong\", she says.",
      "\"Talking about oil is like touching the heart of the government,\" says Mr Bojo Leju.",
      "He spoke to the BBC in Sweden, where he has been granted asylum.",
      "In 2020 he was approached by South Sudanese lawyers who wanted to sue the government over oil pollution.",
      "He agreed to testify as a witness. But he says security personnel detained him, hit him on the head with a pistol and forced him to sign a document recanting his evidence.",
      "He fled the country soon afterwards. The lawyers did not pursue their case.",
      "The BBC asked the oil consortium GPOC and the South Sudanese president\u2019s office to comment on the allegations in this report, but they did not respond.",
      "Scientists are not sure whether the floods in Unity State will ever recede.",
      "Dr Chris Funk, director of the Climate Hazards Center at University of Carolina, Santa Barbara, says 2019 saw record sea surface temperatures in the west Indian Ocean, which \"would have been impossible in a world without climate change\".",
      "Warmer air can hold more moisture, and he says there was a \"strong link\" between these sea temperatures and the 2019 extreme rains over East Africa.",
      "Dr Funk says higher rainfall has continued since then over the Lake Victoria basin that feeds into South Sudan, but it is not clear whether this is a permanent new pattern.",
      "Temperatures in South Sudan have risen and are expected to rise further, he adds.",
      "This means extreme precipitation \"will be more extreme\" and, under some global warming scenarios, heat and humidity could mean some parts of the country \"would not be liveable\", he says.",
      "However, despite the floods and pollution fears, many here hope to return to a life of raising animals and living off the land.",
      "In Roriak, children fashion a miniature village out of the clay on the ground, complete with model huts and cows.",
      "And near Bentiu, an elderly woman grinds water lily roots next to the flood water. She says she would like to a have a cow again, one day.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 00:17:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The South Korean hit drama returns for a second season in December.",
    "story": [
      "When I ask the creator of the hit Korean drama Squid Game about reports that he was so stressed while shooting the first series he lost six teeth, he quickly corrects me. \u201cIt was eight or nine,\u201d he laughs.",
      "Hwang Dong-hyuk is speaking to me on set as he films the second series of his dystopian Netflix thriller, which sees hundreds of debt-laden contestants fight it out for a whopping cash prize, by playing a string of life-or-death children\u2019s games.",
      "But another series was not always on the cards. At one point, he swore against making one.",
      "Given the stress it has caused him, I ask what changed his mind.",
      "\u201cMoney,\u201d he answers, without hesitation.",
      "\u201cEven though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn\u2019t make much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t fully finish the story,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first series was Netflix\u2019s most successful show to date, thrusting South Korea and its home-grown television dramas into the spotlight. Its dark commentary on wealth inequality touched a nerve with audiences around the globe.",
      "But having killed off almost every character, Hwang has had to start from scratch, with a new cast and set of games, and this time audience expectations are sky high.",
      "\u201cThe stress I feel now is much greater,\u201d he says.",
      "Three years after the first series aired, Hwang is even more pessimistic about the state of the world.",
      "He points to current wars, climate change and a widening global wealth gap. Conflicts are no longer confined between the rich and poor, they are playing out intensely between different generations, genders and political camps, he says.",
      "\u201cNew lines are being drawn. We\u2019re in an era of us vs them. Who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong?\u201d",
      "As I toured the show\u2019s playful set, with its distinctive brightly-coloured staircase, I picked up a few clues as to how the director\u2019s despair will be reflected this time around.",
      "In this series, the previous winner, Gi-hun, re-enters the game on a quest to bring it down and save the latest round of contestants.",
      "According to Lee Jung-jae, who plays the leading character, he is \"more desperate and determined\u201d than before.",
      "The floor of the dormitory, where the contestants sleep at night, has been divided in two.",
      "One half is branded with a giant red neon X symbol, the other with a blue circle.",
      "Now, after every game, the players must pick a side, depending on whether they want to end the contest early and survive, or keep playing, in the knowledge all but one of them will die. The majority decision rules.",
      "This, I am told, will lead to more factionalism and fights.",
      "It is part of director Hwang\u2019s plan to expose the dangers of living in an increasingly tribal world. Forcing people to pick sides, he believes, is fuelling conflict.",
      "For all those who were captivated by the shocking storytelling of Squid Game, there were others who found it gratuitously violent and difficult to watch.",
      "But it is clear from talking to Hwang, that the violence is fully thought out. He is a man who thinks and cares deeply about the world and is motivated by a mounting unease.",
      "\u201cWhen making this series, I constantly asked myself \u2018do we humans have what it takes to steer the world off this downhill path?\u2019. Honestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says.",
      "While viewers of the second series might not get the answers to these big life questions, they can at least be comforted that some plot holes will be filled in \u2013 like why the game exists, and what is motivating the masked Front Man running it.",
      "\u201cPeople will see more of the Front Man\u2019s past, his story and his emotions,\u201d reveals the actor Lee Byung-hun, who plays the mysterious role.",
      "\u201cI don't think this will make viewers warm to him, but it may help them better understand his choices.\u201d",
      "As one of South Korea\u2019s most famous actors, Lee admits that having his face and eyes covered and his voice distorted throughout the first series, was \u201ca little bit dissatisfying\u201d.",
      "This series he has relished having scenes without a mask, in which he can fully express himself \u2013 a chance he nearly did not get.",
      "Hwang tried for 10 years to get Squid Game made, taking out large loans to support his family, before Netflix swooped in.",
      "They paid him a modest upfront amount, leaving him unable to cash in on the whopping \u00a3650m it is estimated to have made the platform.",
      "This explains the love-hate relationship South Korea\u2019s film and television creators currently have with international streaming platforms.",
      "Over the past few years, Netflix has stormed the Korean market with billions of dollars of investment, bringing the industry global recognition and love, but leaving creators feeling short-changed.",
      "They accuse the platform of forcing them to relinquish their copyright when they sign contracts \u2013 and with it, their claim to profit.",
      "This is a worldwide problem.",
      "In the past, creators could rely on getting a cut of box office sales or TV re-runs, but this model has not been adopted by streaming giants.",
      "The issue is compounded in South Korea, creators say, due to its outdated copyright law, which does not protect them.",
      "This summer, actors, writers, directors and producers teamed up to form a collective, to fight the system together.",
      "\u201cIn Korea, being a movie director is just a job title, it\u2019s not a way to earn a living,\u201d the vice-president of the Korean Film Directors Guild, Oh Ki-hwan, tells the audience at an event in Seoul.",
      "Some of his director friends, he says, work part-time in warehouses and as taxi drivers.",
      "Park Hae-young is a writer at the event. When Netflix bought her show, 'My Liberation Notes', it became a global hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been writing my whole life. So, to get global recognition when competing with creators from across the world, has been a joyful experience,\u201d she tells me.",
      "But Park says the current streaming model has left her reluctant to \u201cpour her all\u201d into her next series.",
      "\u201cUsually, I\u2019ll spend four or five years making a drama in the belief that, if it's successful, it could somewhat secure my future, that I'll get my fair share of compensation. Without that, what's the point of working so hard?\u201d",
      "She and other creators are pushing the South Korean government to change its copyright law to force production companies to share their profits.",
      "In a statement, the South Korean government told the BBC that while it recognised the compensation system needed to change, it was up to the industry to resolve the issue. A spokesperson for Netflix told us it offers \u201ccompetitive\u201d compensation, and guarantees creators \u201csolid compensation, regardless of the success or failure of their shows\u201d.",
      "Squid Game\u2019s Hwang hopes his candor over his own pay struggles will initiate that change.",
      "He has certainly sparked the fair pay conversation, and this second series will surely give the industry another bump.",
      "But when we catch up after filming has wrapped, he tells me his teeth are aching again.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen my dentist yet, but I\u2019ll probably have to pull out a few more very soon.\u201d",

    "title": "India's luxury airline Vistara flies into the sunset",
    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 03:59:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Vistara is operating its last flight on Monday as it completes its merger with Air India.",
    "story": [
      "Indian full-service carrier Vistara will operate its last flight on Monday, after nine years in existence.",
      "A joint venture between Singapore Airlines and the Tata Sons, Vistara will merge with Tata-owned Air India to form a single entity with an expanded network and broader fleet.",
      "This means that all Vistara operations will be transferred to and managed by Air India, including helpdesk kiosks and ticketing offices. The process of migrating passengers with existing Vistara bookings and loyalty programmes to Air India has been under way over the past few months.",
      "\u201cAs part of the merger process, meals, service ware and other soft elements have been upgraded and incorporates aspects of both Vistara and Air India,\u201d an Air India spokesperson said in an email response.",
      "Amid concerns that the merger could impact service standards, the Tatas have assured that Vistara's in-flight experience will remain unchanged.",
      "Known for its high ratings in food, service, and cabin quality, Vistara has built a loyal customer base and the decision to retire the Vistara brand has been criticised by fans, branding experts, and aviation analysts.",
      "The consolidation was effectively done to clean up Vistara\u2019s books and wipe out its losses, said Mark Martin, an aviation analyst.",
      "Air India has essentially been \u201csuckered into taking a loss-making airline\u201d in a desperate move, he added.",
      "\"Mergers are meant to make airlines powerful. Never to wipe out losses or cover them.\"",
      "To be sure, both Air India and Vistara\u2019s annual losses have reduced by more than half over the past year, and other operating metrics have improved too. But the merger process so far has been turbulent.",
      "The exercise has been riddled with problems \u2013 from pilot shortages that have led to massive flight cancellations, to Vistara crew going on mass sick leave over plans to align their salary structures with Air India.",
      "There have also been repeated complaints about poor service standards on Air India, including viral videos of broken seats and non-functioning inflight entertainment systems.",
      "The Tatas have announced a $400m (\u00a3308m) programme to upgrade and retrofit the interiors of its older aircraft and also a brand-new livery. They\u2019ve also placed orders for hundreds of new Airbus and Boeing planes worth billions of dollars to augment their offering.",
      "But this \u201cturnaround\u201d is still incomplete and riddled with problems, according to Mr Martin. A merger only complicates matters.",
      "Experts say that the merger strikes a dissonant chord from a branding perspective too.",
      "Harish Bijoor, a brand strategy specialist, told the BBC he was feeling \u201cemotional\u201d that a superior product offering like Vistara which had developed a \u201cgold standard for Indian aviation\u201d was ceasing operations.",
      "\u201cIt is a big loss for the industry,\u201d said Mr Bijoor, adding it will be a monumental task for the mother brand Air India to simply \u201ccopy, paste and exceed\u201d the high standards set by Vistara, given that it\u2019s a much smaller airline that\u2019s being gobbled up by a much larger one.",
      "Mr Bijoor suggests a better strategy would have been to operate Air India separately for five years, focusing on improving service standards, while maintaining Vistara as a distinct brand with Air India prefixed to it.",
      "\u201cThis would have given Air India the time and chance to rectify the mother brand and bring it up to the Vistara level, while maintaining its uniqueness,\u201d he adds.",
      "Beyond branding, the merged entity will face a slew of operational challenges.",
      "\"Communication will be a major challenge in the early days, with customers arriving at the airport expecting Vistara flights, only to find Air India branding,\" says Ajay Awtaney, editor of Live From A Lounge, an aviation portal. \"Air India will need to maintain clear communication for weeks.\"",
      "Another key challenge, he notes, is cultural: Vistara's agile employees may struggle to adjust to Air India's complex bureaucracy and systems.",
      "But the biggest task for the merged carrier would be offering customers a uniform flying experience.",
      "These are \u201ctwo airlines with very different service formats are being integrated into one airline. It is going to be a hotchpotch of service formats, cabin formats, branding, and customer experience. It will involve learning and unlearning, and such a process has rarely worked with airlines and is seldom effective,\u201d said Mr Martin.",
      "Still, many believe Vistara had to go \u2013 now or some years later.",
      "A legacy brand like Air India, with strong global recognition and 'India' imprinted in its identity, wouldn\u2019t have allowed a smaller, more premium subsidiary to overshadow its revival process.",
      "Financially too, it makes little sense for the Tatas to have two loss-making entities compete with one another.",
      "The combined strength of Vistara and Air India could also place the Tatas in a much better position to compete with market leader Indigo.",
      "The unified Air India group (including Air India Express, which completed its merger with the former Air Asia India in October) \u201cwill be bigger and better with a fleet size of nearly 300 aircraft, an expanded network and a stronger workforce\u201d, an Air India spokesperson said.",
      "\u201cGetting done with the merger means that Air India grows overnight, and the two teams start cooperating instead of competing. There will never be one right day to merge. Somewhere, a line had to be drawn,\u201d said Mr Awtaney.",
      "But for many Vistara loyalists, its demise leaves a void in India\u2019s skies for a premium, full-service carrier - marking the third such gap after the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways.",
      "It\u2019s still too early to say if Air India, which often ranks at the bottom of airline surveys, can successfully fill that void."

      "There was no sign of Take That or Aitch, or Liam Gallagher - even though he won best rock star.",
      "Organisers made a few subtle nods to the city: The stage was framed in the black and yellow stripes of Factory Records, and New Order's Blue Monday pumped through the speakers every time nominees were announced.",
      "But the show took a more global perspective, highlighting acts from Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and America - including a predictable victory for Taylor Swift in the night's two biggest categories, best artist and video of the year.",
      "She only appeared by video, choosing instead to spend the night watching her boyfriend, American Football player Travis Kelce, lead the Kansas City Chiefs to victory against the Denver Broncos.",
      "But there were plenty of other stars at the show and on the red carpet. Here's some of the gossip we picked up along the way.",
      "1) Raye gave an update on her missing song books",
      "Two weeks ago, Raye told fans her second album had been delayed by thieves who stole her car and, with it, several notebooks full of lyrics and song ideas.",
      "On the red carpet, she confirmed the police hadn't been able to track them down, saying: \"I've just had to let it go.\"",
      "The singer said she couldn't recreate a lot of the ideas, because the act of writing them down freed her mind to work on other things.",
      "\"You let it go, because you think you can come back to it - and now there are so many ideas that are just gone. It's so sad.\"",
      "But the singer, who won best UK artist, maintained a positive outlook.",

      "2) Busta Rhymes revealed his unlikely comedy hero",
      "The decision to bring rap legend Busta Rhymes to Manchester to receive a global icon award wasn't as random as it sounded.",
      "Before he developed his rapid-fire rap delivery, an 11-year-old Rhymes spent two summers living with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe.",

      "Manchester is home to the UK's biggest K-Pop shop and, on Sunday morning, the staff couldn't quite believe one of the genre's biggest girl bands had landed in their city.",
      "\"Le Sserafim were posting pictures from the Christmas market,\" one of them told me. \"That's only five minutes from here!\"",
      "The five-piece, who've been setting chart records over in the US, jetted in for their first-ever UK performance, a mash-up of Chasing Lightning and the 90s house banger Crazy.",

      "\"It was so good, we had baklava!\" enthused singer Huh Yun-Jin; while her bandmate Sakura tucked into a portion of fish and chips.",
      "\"It was my first time,\" she said. \"I loved it.\"",

      "\"Coming to Europe is something that we've always dreamt of, so this is absolutely surreal,\" said Yun-Jin. \"We just want to make a good impression.\"",
      "Mission accomplished.",
      "6) Jedward spent two hours on the red carpet",
      "For absolutely no reason at all, Jedward went on a massive charm offensive for the international press.",
      "\"Oasis are back and Jedward are back!\" they declared, before racing over to baffled German and French journalists, while singing Stop Crying Your Heart Out.",

      "It was only fitting that the event marked his death - but striking the right tone in the middle of a huge showbiz event is never easy.",
      "In the end, his friend and collaborator Rita Ora just spoke from the heart.",
      "\"There were so many ways that we were talking about honouring him,\" she said. \"But sometimes simply speaking is enough.\"",
      "Addressing the camera directly, she shared her memories of the 31-year-old, as her voice cracked.",
      "\"Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew,\" she said. \"He brought so much joy to every room he walked into. And he left such a mark on this world.\"",

      "The exact same dress had previously been worn by US rapper Eve at the 2000 Soul Train Awards.",
      "And R&B legend Aaliyah wore a canary yellow version at the 2000 MTV Awards, where she won best female video for Try Again.",
      "The ceremony took place in September 2000, less than a year before Aaliyah's tragic death in an plane accident.",
      "The singer was just 22 at the time - the same age that Tyla is now."

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 04:21:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Building the link to western Europe has become more urgent as the Baltics see Russia as a threat.",
    "story": [
      "The three Baltic states came up with the idea years ago for a high-speed railway spanning 870km (540 miles) across Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.",
      "Rail Baltica began as a grand project, but it has now become a strategic imperative: since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Baltics increasingly view their neighbour as an existential threat.",
      "Currently, there is no direct link that crosses the Baltics and connects with Poland.",
      "Rail Baltica will do that, cutting travel time and bringing economic and environmental benefits, but the costs of this ambitious scheme are mounting.",
      "Meanwhile, Baltic states and their Nato allies need the railway in place fast.",
      "Estonia's Infrastructure Minister Vladimir Svet said the rail link is vital amid the Russian war in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cHistory is repeating itself,\u201d he said. \u201cPutin's aggressive regime is trying to recreate an imperial project on the territory of the former Soviet bloc.\"",
      "The memory of decades of Soviet occupation is still fresh in the Baltics. Moscow deported hundreds of thousands of people from the region to Siberia.",
      "Estonia and Latvia share land borders with Russia, while Lithuania is adjacent to the Russian enclave Kaliningrad, which also shares a border with Poland, and Moscow's close ally, Belarus.",
      "About 10,000 Nato soldiers are currently stationed in the Baltics, alongside local troops. Their total number could reach 200,000 in a worst-case scenario.",
      "\u201cRail Baltica will increase military mobility and allow trains to go directly from the Netherlands to Tallinn,\u201d Cmdr Peter Nielsen, from Nato's Force Integration Unit, said.",
      "For Estonia's infrastructure minister, the railway is \u201can unbreakable link with the networks of Europe\u201d.",
      "Not far from the Estonian capital, Tallinn, at the tip of the railway, dozens of workers are welding and hammering away at the new \u00dclemiste passenger terminal.",
      "\u201cThis will be the network's most northern point, the starting point of 215km of railway in Estonia and 870km across the three Baltic States,\u201d said Anvar Salomets, CEO of Rail Baltica Estonia, stepping carefully across the embryonic platforms.",
      "Until now, the Baltics have used a Russian track width because their rail system dates back to the Soviet era.",
      "Passengers have to change trains to the European system when they get to the Polish border.",
      "The new network will use the European railway track width and connect seamlessly with railways across the EU.",
      "LISTEN: Building a geopolitical railway",
      "Baltic concerns over plans to move Russia's sea borders",
      "\u201cThe trains will run at up to 250km/h (155mph) compared with 80 or 120km/h (50 or 74mph) right now,\u201d Salomets added.",
      "That means journey times from Tallinn to the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, will be massively reduced, from at least 12 hours now to under four.",
      "\u201cIt'll be a game-changer, decreasing the environmental impact across our whole transport sector,\u201d says Salomets, who foresees big economic benefits.",
      "Recent analysis for the Rail Baltica consortium estimates the overall economic boost at \u20ac6.6bn (\u00a35.5bn).",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of studies of existing high speed rail systems show a positive economic impact,\u201d said Adam Cohen of the University of California at Berkeley.",
      "But those benefits will not appear overnight and there is growing concern at the spiralling cost. Developers' estimates have increased fourfold since 2017 and now stand at \u20ac24bn.",
      "So far, the EU has subsidised 85% of the project and has just announced another \u20ac1.1bn.",
      "Estonia and Latvia have also come under criticism for focusing on putting up the rail terminals first before they build the mainline.",
      "French engineer Emilien Dang, whose RB Rail oversees the project, blamed recent global crises for the big spike in costs: \u201cOur initial estimate hadn't taken into account the Covid pandemic and high inflation - and the situation in Ukraine has dramatically increased the cost of material.\u201d",
      "As he walked across a big new terminal in the Latvian capital Riga, he also cited cultural issues.",
      "\u201cThe view from France, wrongly, is that the Baltics are one unit.  But they are three countries, with different regulations.\u201d",
      "The Baltic states have decided to split the project into two phases. The first, costing \u20ac15bn, will have a single instead of double track laid by 2030 and focus on the most important train stops.",
      "The second track and additional train stations are to be completed as part of a second phase with no specific completion date yet.",
      "The soaring costs have prompted the states to scale back some of their ambitions.",
      "\u201cWe can further scale back the scope of phase one, for example by connecting Riga airport at a later stage,\u201d said Andris Kulbergs, who chairs a Latvian parliamentary committee investigating the project.",
      "As billions of euros for the first phase are yet to be secured, that might be necessary.",
      "Estonia's national auditor Janar Holm believes several more years of delays are likely: \u201cWe have to find the funds to build this railway now or it'll be even more expensive.\u201d",
      "The country's infrastructure minister, Vladimir Svet, insisted \"we are decreasing the budget as much as possible, we\u2019ve rationalised the public procurement process and, if necessary, we'll take on a loan.\"",
      "\u201cIf we want to preserve our culture and feel secure about our freedom, there is no other way than being in a strong EU, Nato and international community that supports international law,\u201d he added.",
      "For the three Baltic states that broke free of the Soviet Union to join the EU and Nato, Rail Baltica could serve as a lifeline - if it manages to stay on track.",
      "Mystery fires were Russian 'test runs' to target cargo flights to US",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 10:06:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Cheers\" actor's new series is the Netflix comedy \"A Man on the Inside,\" in which he plays a retired widower-turned-investigator who goes undercover in a nursing home.",
    "story": [
      "Sitting down to talk about his new TV show, Ted Danson admits he is nervous. Why? \"Because I want people to see it, I really do,\" he said. \"I think it's an important conversation.\"",
      "It's strange to think of Danson as nervous about anything, but in this case, it's not hard to see why: his latest project means a lot to him, about a subject that touches everyone. In the new Netflix series \"A Man on the Inside,\" Danson is a recently-retired widower without much to do, until he answers an ad from a private investigator, and becomes a mole inside a nursing home.",
      "Like a lot of TV series, the premise seems a little far-fetched, but this one's true: it's based on \"The Mole Agent,\" a 2020 documentary about a real-life 83-year-old who goes undercover in a Chilean nursing home looking for signs of patients being mistreated. What the documentary found was a group of elderly people fighting loneliness and loss with heart and humor.",
      "\"A Man on the Inside\" is no different, says series creator Mike Schur. \"I would say the purpose of this show is simply to discuss a subject that very few people discuss, which is aging,\" said Schur. \"It's this subject that we just don't like to talk about. It's thought of in this country (I think more than other countries) as something almost shameful or embarrassing.\"",
      "\"If you're dying, you somehow made a mistake,\" said Danson.",
      "\"You screwed up! Yeah, you screwed up, you got old, you know?\" Schur said. \"And I think that's weird, because this is what happens if we're lucky. If we're lucky, we get old!\"",
      "At 76, Danson himself is aging gracefully, with an attitude inspired by a Hollywood legend: Jane Fonda. \"She was turning 80, and at 70 I was starting to go, 'Well, I'd better look for a nice place to land, you know, this life plane,' or whatever,\" he said. \"And I looked at her and it was like, no. She has her foot on the gas pedal! She's, like, doing a 12-hour day, shooting her show, jumping on a bus to go, you know, support the service industry in Sacramento with a handful of women.",
      "\"Don't slow down, just keep going, keep living your life. I think that's one of the things our elders can pass on to us. This is how you live life right up until the end.\"",
      "Seems like Danson's elders set a good example: his parents wouldn't allow a TV in their home. \"My mother didn't like them,\" he said. \"She'd rather you read, or go out and play, or be creative.\"",
      "But then, Danson got famous, on TV. \u00a0His parents finally got one. \"But they put kind of this beautiful tapestry over the front of it, so when you walked in their house, you didn't see a TV, you saw this beautiful tapestry with a candle on top, and they would take it off and watch 'Cheers,'\" he said.",
      "Danson still credits his success today to that one show about a Boston bar. But since he hung up his bartender apron in 1993, he's been in hit after hit. He was the title character in \"Becker.\" In \"Damages,\" he held his own with Glenn Close. He went to heaven and hell in \"The Good Place.\" And he's even played himself in \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"",
      "Along the way Danson has used his fame to draw attention to his passion project, Oceana, an organization dedicated to preserving the world's oceans. Asked if he feels they have made progress, he replied, \"Yes. I mean, our focus is fishing, over-fishing, making sure that the fisheries of the world are healthy. Because if done right, you could feed a billion people a fish meal every day.\"",
      "That sounds a little like a miracle \u2013 something he touches on in his new show, and something he says he lives with every day.",
      "Asked what are the miracles in his life, Danson replied, \"Mary Steenburgen is, you know, literally heaven-sent. I did some work on myself for about a year before I met her, after 'Cheers,' becoming emotionally mature and real. And I worked hard at it. And then along came Mary Steenburgen. \u2026 We are so blessed. To love somebody and to be loved, is just one of those heaven-on-earth miracles, you know? And that came with Mary.\"",
      "And the idea Ted Danson is hoping to share with his latest project is that miracles can be found in any life, right up until the very end. \"This is your life,\" he said, \"not just up to, you know, 65 and then you retire and are going down. No, you get to live right up until you don't live. And it's your life. It's such a gift. Explore it, and be excited about it. Yes, it hurts. Yes, it's sad. Yes, there's grief. Yes, there's all of that. But embrace it. Embrace it, is kind of what I think the message of the show is. It's what I hope I live with.\"",

      "\"It was so fun!\" Burnett laughed. \"That's what I mean. It's fun to do the dark world, you know, as long as you don't have to actually live in it!\"",
      "Joseph Henry Burnett III grew up in Fort Worth, Texas. He can't recall how he got his nickname T Bone.",
      "He was on the high school golf team. Golfing great Ben Hogan practiced at the course where he played: \"And when he would hit that ball in those pecan trees over there, the resonance, that's one of the places where I began falling in love with sound, actually, on the golf course, 'cause he would hit, crack that thing and you could hear it all through the trees. Isn't that crazy? You know, I'm just sonically oriented.\"",
      "In 1975, Bob Dylan recruited Burnett to play guitar in his \"Rolling Thunder\" revue, starting a lifelong friendship. In 2021, they played together again, re-recording Dylan's classic, \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" using a special high fidelity analog system that Burnett says creates the highest quality audio ever.",
      "\"We decided to just make one disc; there are no copies,\" he said. \"The germ of it was, I wanted to do something that couldn't be put online. It couldn't be commoditized. I'm not doing this to keep it away from anybody. I'm just doing it to work at the highest possible level.\"\u00a0The disc sold at auction in 2022 for nearly $1.8 million.",
      "Burnett said, \"I love the process of recording. I love going into a room where there's nothing, and then you come out and there's something.\"",
      "\"It's a mystical kind of thing,\" said Mason.",
      "\"Yeah, it is to me. And you build a world of resonance, and that's the stuff that's the most thrilling to me, and the part of life that a machine will never comprehend.\"",
      "T Bone Burnett's new record earned a Grammy nomination this past week for best Americana album, and at 76, he's even starting to enjoy another sound \u2026 the sound of a crowd. \"I think I had a much more benevolent view of the audience than I used to have,\" he said.",
      "\"And that's because you're just not overthinking it?\" asked Mason.",
      "\"Yeah. That's exactly right!\" he laughed.",
      "Asked what music gives him, Burnett replied, \"Well, everything, really. It's my religion. Music gives me life and hope and love, and everything worth having, really!\"",

      "\"For the prosecution, this situation would also rule out the possibility of a conscious or voluntary act on the part of the victim,\" the prosecutor's office said.",
      "The investigation included nine raids on homes in the region and dozens of interviews with hotel staff, Payne's family and friends and experts in the fields of medicine, biochemistry and psychiatry, the prosecutor's office said. Investigators also reviewed more than 800 hours of video footage from the hotel and public roads and conducted a forensic analysis of Payne's cell phone to review his digital footprint in the period leading up to his death.",
      "An autopsy was also conducted. After that, Payne's body was returned to his father, Geoff Payne, who had been in Argentina since the day after his son's death.",
      "Toxicology tests conducted as part of the autopsy showed that Payne \"only had traces\" of drug use in his system. There were \"traces\" of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant, the prosecutor's office said. Medical experts found that Payne only had injuries from his fall.",
      "All of the information gathered by investigators was summarized into a 180-page report presented to Judge Laura Bruniard, who oversees criminal cases. Bruniard approved the charges against the three people, but the investigation will continue, the prosecutor's office said, as investigators continue to try to access Payne's other personal devices.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:30:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 10:30:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has long been used to combat compression sickness in divers. But at a hospital in Israel they're using it to address a very different malady - post-traumatic stress disorder - for military veterans and survivors of terror attacks.",
    "story": [
      "Idit Negrin would try anything to beat the trauma haunting her since attending the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, when Hamas massacred hundreds of civilians. \"We saw the terrorists, and they started shooting at us,\" she said. She ran for her life.",
      "Afterwards, \"I woke up every night, every night around 3 o'clock screaming and sweating and shaking. I think after a day, or two days after, I felt that I'm falling down, crying.\"",
      "We met her this summer as she was two-thirds of the way through her 60-session course of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). It's a treatment long used to combat compression sickness in divers, and wounds that will not heal. But at the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research, in Be'er Ya'akov, Israel, they're now also treating a very different malady: post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.",
      "Negrin described her experiences with PTSD: \"You feel like you're going crazy. I call people and scream, 'There is a terror attack again!' And then you understand that you have no control of your brain.\"",
      "Negrin is trying to regain that control, along with about 650 other October 7th survivors suffering from PTSD who are being treated, for free, alongside military veterans at the Sagol Center \u2013 currently the largest hyperbaric center worldwide.",
      "Dr. Shai Efrati runs this clinic, where they're treating up to 350 patients a day, and are on the forefront of this sort of medicine. \"What we are doing is actually tricking the body,\" Efrati said. \"Hypoxia, lack of oxygen, is the most powerful trigger to induce all the repair mechanism cascade.\"",
      "Efrati says they're inducing repair mechanisms in the body and brain inside these pressurized chambers, where it feels like you're scuba diving down to 30 feet. Patients breathe in pure oxygen, which under such high-pressure conditions the body can absorb at up to 16 times the normal level. Then, masks are removed for five-minute intervals.",
      "Efrati said, \"The decline from very high back to the normal is being interpreted at the similar level as hypoxia, as lack of oxygen. That causes the body to trigger the stem cells, and for the first time even in humans, we can see generation of new neurons, generation of new blood vessels in the brain. And this is mind-blowing.\"",
      "The treatment has been described as \"unapproved\" and \"not proven.\" \"When we speak about hyperbaric oxygen therapy, this is how it should look like,\" Efrati said.",
      "\"You're saying there are a lot of frauds out there?\" asked Doane.",
      "\"Indeed. And this is not only not good, it can be even dangerous.\"",
      "Dr. Efrati is constantly experimenting with new ways to use this treatment. At his clinic near Tel Aviv, we got to see how they're catering hyperbaric medicine to athletes (\"If we can shorten the recovery period, you can push harder doing the exercises\"), and helping patients with brain injuries regain movement through the growth of new neurons and blood vessels in the brain.",
      "\"It's not that we are fixing his running,\" Efrati said about one athlete's performance. \"We are fixing the brain.\"",
      "They've published several studies, looking at PTSD in veterans. One, out today, found that 68% of patients showed significant improvement. Another reported that PTSD remission lasted at least two years, which is higher than other established treatments. \"We want to evaluate everything objectively,\" said Efrati.",
      "It's conclusive enough for the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, to ask Efrati's team to stop testing and start treating. The doctor says that while you can always ask for more data, \"You see the evidence in front of you.\"",
      "Shachar Mizrhai was one of those IDF veterans referred in 2018 for the initial clinical trial. He was a soldier during a 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza and was in an armored vehicle when it was ambushed. In the short term, he was thinking about survival; the suffering came later. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"In the moment I put [on] the uniform, I feel like I want to die. I smell blood. I smell war.\"",
      "He'd tried drugs, therapy and sleeping pills. He contemplated suicide. \"Nothing really helped to get back to life,\" he said. \"And I heard that this might be help, and maybe this is my last chance before I finish my life.\"",
      "Dr. Keren Doenyas-Barak, who heads the PTSD program at the Sagol Center, followed Mizrhai through his 60 sessions, and showed us his brain scans from June 2018, and March 2019, highlighting activation of areas used to effectively regulate emotion, or process information. The later brain scan images were lighting up; that wasn't happening before the treatment.",
      "\"Many people tend to look at PTSD as a psychological phenomenon, not as a biological phenomenon,\" Doenyas-Barak said. \"So, we treat PTSD very similar to other brain conditions.\"",
      "For Mizrhai, the treatment changed everything:\" \"It's the first time that I was feeling again. I begin to sleep at night, I was less afraid. It's make me feel alive again. \u2026 I was a dying man, and after this, I'm a living man.\"",
      "North Carolina Republican Congressman and medical doctor Greg Murphy said, \"If it's being offered in Israel and they're getting such good results, why the hell are we not offering it in the United States?\"",
      "That's a question Murphy \u2013 a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs \u2013 is raising in the halls of Congress. One in 10 of his constituents is a veteran. \"I love our VA,\" he said. \"But we're not reaching a certain segment of our veterans if we're having 22 commit suicide every day. And if we're doing something and there is a treatment that has shown definitive results, I believe it's medical malpractice not to offer that to our veterans.\"",
      "In 2023 he introduced the Veterans' National Traumatic Injury Treatment Act. \"We just basically want the VA to do a pilot study within their own confines to see whether they show that hyperbaric oxygen works or not,\" he said.",
      "And what is he hearing from the VA? \"They just don't want to do anything; it's just hands up,\" he said. \"The reasons that we've heard is, 'Well, the results are mixed.' Fine. Look at the results in the last 15 years. Look at the studies in Israel. We are seeing an absolute effect in this, and other disorders, for Parkinson's, migraines, some even MS, neurological disorders.\"",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" requested an interview with the Department of Veterans Affairs, but they declined to comment.",
      "In Salt Lake City, Utah, we met Dr. Lin Weaver, who runs Hyperbaric Medicine at Intermountain Health. They treat about 20 patients a day, which puts into perspective the huge numbers - 350 daily \u2013 being treated in Israel. \u00a0He says they use their hyperbaric chambers for PTSD patients rarely, because it is expensive, but he has seen positive results: \"I've had patients that I've treated. Every one has got surprisingly better,\" Weaver said.",
      "But insurance companies say there is not enough proof it works for PTSD. And in the U.S., out-of-pocket costs soar above $50,000.",
      "\"What's necessary is like a drug trial,\" Weaver said. \"But these trials take years to accomplish. It all rests with, 'Is there an initiative? And is there a funding source?'\"",
      "Doane asked, \"But if doctors like you feel so strongly that this works, why isn't there enough push coming from folks like you to say, 'Prove this'?\"",
      "\"Well, believe me, we've tried,\" Weaver replied. \"I have submitted proposals to extramural funding agencies. So far, they haven't accepted them.\"",
      "Doane asked Dr. Efrati, \"You are out on the frontier here of medicine. Is there a danger in that?\"",
      "\"As a scientist, I will always tell you I need more study, I need more data,\" he replied. \"But as a physician, when I'm sitting in front of you looking at your eyes, you have a problem now. This is our job as a physician.\"",
      "Idit Negrin says this treatment is giving her hope she can move past that nightmare at the Nova Music Festival. She hopes, with the therapy, she can move on with her life.",
      "But she wears a reminder \u2013 a Nova necklace \u2013 while she gets treatment. \"I don't get her off my neck,\" she said.",
      "Her progress is motivation for Dr. Efrati to keep innovating, thinking about the future so his patients can process the past.",
      "Doane said, \"Some people are gonna listen to this and say it sounds too good to be true.\"",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign say.",
      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",
      "Kennedy's supporters argue that the election offers a mandate not just for Trump's platform overall but for Kennedy and his \"Make America Healthy Again\" proposals to combat chronic disease, citing the votes Kennedy may have delivered in Trump's favor.",
      "As one example, podcast host Joe Rogan initially voiced support for Kennedy and his ideas before later endorsing Trump.",
      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",
      "Other potential HHS secretary picks",
      "However, Kennedy is not the only name that has been floated by Republicans for the top job at HHS.",
      "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suggested Wednesday his top health official, state surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo, could be a candidate. Under Ladapo, the state's health department has warned some against getting COVID-19 booster shots, citing claims that federal health authorities and outside experts criticized as unproven or misleading.",
      "Other names floated by Trump allies in Washington include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former deputy HHS secretary Eric Hargan, who supporters think could be effective because he knows how to navigate the department's bureaucracy.",
      "But people close to the campaign say few Trump surrogates and supporters have spent as much time with the president-elect as Kennedy or plotted as ambitious an agenda.",
      "The two spent hours flying together in the final stretch of the campaign. Kennedy was also in Florida after the election, huddling with the president-elect's top ranks to weigh potential candidates to fill the administration.",
      "\"He's going to help make America healthy again. And he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it,\" Trump said on Wednesday morning after the election.",
      "Trump has previously said he's been friends with Kennedy \"for a long time\" and would let him \"go wild\" on many of his policy priorities, except for curbing fossil fuels.",
      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet,\" Trump said in New York on Oct. 27.",
      "Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform",
      "Kennedy's nomination would come at a key time for many of the issues he campaigned on, which he says underpin \"the chronic-disease crisis.\"",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of \"aggressive suppression\" of a range of products, including psychedelics \u2014 after MDMA failed to earn the agency's approval earlier this year \u2014 and raw milk, which officials have discouraged amid the ongoing bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "In the days ahead of the election, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to \"root out the corruption and the conflicts of interests\" in agencies that oversee drugs and vaccines, pledging to \"restore transparency\" and stop \"hiding science.\"",
      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",
      "His call for stopping water fluoridation comes as the Environmental Protection Agency is now facing a court order to take action against the practice.",
      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",
      "But were he to end up HHS secretary, some of Kennedy's aims would fall outside of his jurisdiction, like the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Other responsibilities under the broad HHS umbrella could consume much of Kennedy's time, some allies worry, distracting from his priorities.",
      "\"Bobby is very action-oriented, brilliant, an excellent communicator, has a great grasp of details, and is a transformational leader. He is not, his skillset is not, as a bureaucrat administrator,\" said Dr. Robert Malone, a longtime Kennedy ally who was with him and Trump on election night.",
      "Malone said he had spoken with many of the aides from some of the \"at least four different HHS transition teams\" under Trump, but not personally with Kennedy, in recent weeks about the future of the department.",
      "He said he thought Kennedy would likely do better in a role at the White House, serving as a czar who could target specific issues across different departments.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 17:54:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:30:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",
      "Making the enhanced subsidies permanent would cost $335 billion over 10 years,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CBO.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Measure that would repeal so-called \"government pensions offset\" has been gaining support in House.",
    "story": [
      "The House is expected to try to pass a Social Security-related bill this week to ensure benefits for workers who are also eligible for other pensions, despite a surprise move by hard-right Freedom Caucus leaders to derail the effort.",
      "It's a quick turnaround to salvage what had been a bipartisan effort to pass the bill, called the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, during what's now the lame-duck post-election period of the Congress.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal the so-called \"government pensions offset,\" or GPO, which reduces Social Security spousal or widow(er) benefits for those who receive noncovered pensions, according to the Social Security Administration's\u00a0website.",
      "The summary also says the bill also eliminates the so-called \"windfall elimination provision\" that \"in some instances reduces Social Security benefits for individuals who also receive a pension or disability benefit from an employer that did not withhold Social Security taxes.\"",
      "Such pensions are paid by employers \u2014 typically, state and local governments or non-U.S. employers \u2014 that do not withhold Social Security taxes from employee salaries.",
      "\"The GPO reduces the spousal or widow(er) benefit by two-thirds of the monthly non-covered pension and can partially, or fully, offset an individual's spousal/widow(er) benefit, depending on the amount of the non-covered pension,\" according to SSA.gov.",
      "The bill would repeal the GPO provision and reinstate full Social Security benefits.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, an individual with a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security, who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension, would see their Social Security benefit reduced by $667, or two-thirds the non-covered pension amount. That leaves them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit.",
      "If the GPO measure is repealed, the same individual would be entitled to the entire $900 spousal benefit amount without an offset reduction.",
      "Does the bill have bipartisan support?",
      "Yes, the bill was introduced by a Republican, Rep. Garrett Graves of Louisiana, and a Democrat, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and it has gained support in the House. A robust 300 lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have signed on to it.",
      "Other groups have also supported the bill, such as the National Association of Counties, which represents county governments. That group says that eliminating the GPO would help county governments recruit workers at a time when many are facing labor shortages.",
      "What happened next to the bill?",
      "To force the legislation forward, the sponsors of the bill, Rep. Graves and Rep. Spanberger, this fall used a rarely successful process called a discharge petition.",
      "They collected the minimum 218 signatures needed from House lawmakers to dislodge the bill from committee and send it to the floor for a vote.",
      "The move is often seen as an affront to House leaders, particularly the House speaker and the majority leader who determine the floor schedule.",
      "But Spanberger and Graves \u2014 who both did not seek reelection \u2014 had little to lose. Besides, Johnson backed the bill before becoming speaker.",
      "Did the House Freedom Caucus block the Social Security bill?",
      "Two leaders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus intervened when the rest of Congress was away from Capitol Hill, mostly in home states for Election Day.",
      "The Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., and former chair Rep. Bob Goode, R-Va., used a routine pro forma session of the House on Nov.\u00a05 to swiftly table part of the measure.",
      "The Freedom Caucus tends to block new spending. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add some $196 billion to the federal deficit over a decade.",
      "Graves said that's the amount people are missing out on without reinstating full Social Security benefits.",
      "But in tabling the legislation the conservatives actually set back its procedural rule, but not the bill itself.",
      "The legislation is expected to move forward with a House vote anyway, possibly in the week ahead.",
      "Could the Social Security Fairness Act still pass?",
      "Yes, but that said, passage will now be tougher, requiring a supermajority threshold rather than a simple majority as had been planned under the rule that the Freedom Caucus leaders turned back.",
      "If it passes the House, it's unclear if the bill has enough support to clear the Senate. But the wide margin in the House indicates potentially broad support.",
      "It would then go to President Joe Biden's desk. If signed into law, the summary says the changes are effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",

      "Part B covers visits to doctors, outpatient care, preventative services such as vaccines, medical equipment like wheelchairs as well as home health care. (Part A, which covers inpatient care in hospitals and other facilities, is premium-free for all but about 1% of beneficiaries due to taxes paid by most retirees while they worked.)",

      "The standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B enrollees will climb by $10.30, or about 6%, to $185.00 from $174.70 in 2024, CMS said\u00a0Friday.",
      "Meanwhile, the annual deductible for all Medicare Part B beneficiaries will rise to $257 in 2025 from $240.",
      "The reason for the 2025 premium and deductible increases is due to \"projected price changes and assumed utilization increases that are consistent with historical experience,\" according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "The premium stood at $164.90 in 2023, when the cost fell just over $5 from the year before, a rare decline.",
      "How does that compare with the Social Security COLA?",
      "Medicare's Part B premiums have generally outrun inflation as well as Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA).",
      "Yearly inflation climbed 2.4% in September, while the Social Security COLA for next year will be 2.5%, or an average of $50 more per household.",
      "What do higher-income Medicare enrollees pay?",
      "Given that a beneficiary's Part B monthly premium is based on one's income, wealthier Americans also pay an Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount, or IRMAA, which impacts about 8% of those with Medicare Part B, CMS stated.",
      "Those who are married and lived with their spouses at any time during the year, but who file separate tax returns with modified adjusted gross income of $106,000 or less, will pay just the Medicare Part B premium of $185.00 a month.\u00a0Beneficiaries with incomes above $106,000 but below $394,000 are looking at paying IRMAA of $406.90 plus the standard $185.00, or $591.90 a month.\u00a0Seniors with incomes in excess of $394,000 will pay $443.90 in IRMAA and the standard $185.00, or a total of $628.90 a month.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Thursday announced its second interest rate cut of 2024, trimming its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points amid cooling inflation. The expected move by the U.S. central bank provides additional relief to millions of Americans grappling with high borrowing costs.",
      "The Fed cut, half the size of its September reduction, lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% from its current 4.75% to 5% level.",
      "The announcement marks the Fed's first interest rate decision since President-elect Donald Trump secured another term in the White House\u00a0following the Nov. 5 election. In\u00a0exit polls\u00a0on Tuesday, many voters reported that they're still hurting from the sharpest inflation in 40 years and expressed dissatisfaction with the nation's economic trajectory.",
      "Inflation remains \"somewhat elevated\"",
      "Although inflation has since cooled and now hovers just above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate, prices remain high, while elevated borrowing costs have also hit people's pocketbooks.",
      "\"Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-setting panel, said in its statement. \"Inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.\"",
      "The two rate cuts so far this year, which have reduced the federal funds rate by a combined 0.75 percentage points, but the larger impact will be felt if the Fed continues to cut rates at its December meeting and into 2025, experts say.",
      "\"The Fed cutting rates a quarter point this month is more about a long-term trend,\" Christopher Clarke, a professor of economics at Washington State University, told CBS News. \"People should think about this as a half a point a month ago, a quarter point this month, a quarter point next month.\"",
      "He added, \"Overall, we're expecting a whole percentage point this year and another percentage point next year, so that's going to lower interest rates on auto loans, mortgages, credit cards, et cetera.\"",
      "Analysts with Capital Economics predicted the Fed would drop its benchmark rate by a quarter point at each of its next three meetings, with the rate bottoming out in May between 3.50% and 3.75%.",
      "Will Trump win affect the Fed's thinking?",
      "While many economists expect an additional cut at the Fed's December meeting and more reductions in early 2025, any future moves by monetary policy makers appear more uncertain following the election amid concerns that some of Trump's key economic proposals could stoke inflation.",
      "\"With additional inflation and employment data in, the Fed went 25 basis points as expected.

      "ICE is biggest customer",
      "During Trump's first term in office, from 2017-2021, immigration detention expanded at record levels, according to an ACLU report. In 2019, ICE detained an average of over 50,000 people each day. At times, that number exceeded 56,000 \u2014 about 50% more than peak levels during the Obama administration, according to the report. During his first term in office, Trump expanded the federal government's use of private prison companies to detain immigrants.",
      "As of January 2020, 81% of people detained in ICE custody across the U.S. were held in facilities owned or managed by private prison corporations, according to the ACLU report.",
      "In his second term, President-elect Trump promises a radical shift in policy at the U.S.-Mexico border from his predecessor. That includes a pledge to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history, which could bring significantly more business to CoreCivic and Geo Group.",
      "For the first nine months of 2024, ICE accounted for 30% of each company's revenue.",
      "Both Geo Group and CoreCivic said they currently have excess capacity to accommodate a larger population of detainees. CoreCivic executives noted that they're taking steps to prepare to activate additional capacity to meet ICE's needs. That could include reconfiguring facilities to accommodate a bigger intake area, they noted.",
      "\"There is room for an uptick in occupancy from a capacity standpoint and both companies expect an ask from the Trump administration for more beds. The question is how much, and we just don't know right now,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Brian Violino told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Monitoring",
      "Geo Group also provides monitoring services for ICE under its Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), a monitoring program using wearable technology that serves as an alternative to detention.",
      "\"If there is a finite number of beds and a significant number of people are detained, which Trump is discussing in his plans, there could be an increased usage in this alternative to detention,\" Violino said.",
      "Geo Group executives said they have the necessary technology and staffing resources to scale up the contract to more than several million participants, if necessary.",
      "Funding from Congress",
      "The degree to which ICE expands its contracts with the two largest private prison companies depends on how big of an increase in funding Congress authorizes. While Republicans won the Senate majority in Tuesday's election, it remains to be seen which party will obtain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "\"That's a big part of the story, and if it's a Republican sweep, it will be easier for Trump to get funding from Congress to support this operation he's looking to do,\" Violino said.",

      "Between finding openings, sending out your resume and interviewing, looking for a job is tough. Now a growing trend of\u00a0scammers\u00a0impersonating recruiters is making it even harder.",
      "In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised.",
      "Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information.",
      "\"We've really seen tremendous growth in job scams,\" Velasquez said. \"I think that's just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.\"",
      "It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.",
      "After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment she'd need for the job.",
      "A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That's when she learned the job was a scam.",
      "\"I'm a little traumatized,\" said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.",
      "If you're a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers:",
      "Job scams are a type of\u00a0impersonation scam.",
      "Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.",
      "\"They're going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,\" she said. \"And they're often saying it's a 100% remote position because that's so appealing to people.\"",
      "Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver's license details.",
      "The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.",
      "Other details don't generally need to be shared with an employer until after you've gotten an offer.",
      "Whether you're replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn't initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.",
      "Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.",
      "Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:",
      "\u2014 Don't respond to the message right away.",
      "\u2014 Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.",
      "\u2014 Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.",
      "\u2014 If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.",
      "If you receive a message from a recruiter, it's best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.",
      "In Islam's case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.",
      "A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "\"If you deposit a check and it's fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,\" Puig said.",
      "So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.",
      "When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.",
      "\"Don't let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,\" Velasquez said.",
      "After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter's email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.",
      "\"This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can't just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,\" Islam said.",

While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the November 5 election highlights the frustrations of millions of voters, with many Americans noting in\u00a0exit polls on Tuesday that they're still hurting from the highest inflation in 40 years and dissatisfied with the nation's economic trajectory.",
      "Trump ran on a campaign that vowed to tackle those issues, pledging to end the \"inflation nightmare\"\u00a0and to bring prices down \"very quickly.\" He also offered a myriad of tax cuts to various groups, ranging from senior citizens to homeowners, as well as to finance some of those cuts through new tariffs on imports from China and other nations and to\u00a0deport millions of undocumented immigrants.",
      "In the aftermath of Trump's win, economists and policy experts are assessing how those policies might impact the economy as well as consumers' wallets. Already, Wall Street is predicting that his policies could boost corporate growth, sending the S&P 500 higher by as much as 2.2% on Wednesday.",
      "But some experts note Trump's plans may also boost inflation, potentially hurting consumers who are hoping for relief at the checkout counter.",
      "\"The devil will be in the details,\" Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at investment bank Raymond James, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump tax, trade, tariff and immigration agenda could have significant economic impacts and raise concerns about a second wave of inflation.\"",
      "However, compromises or alterations to his plans \"could mitigate the impact,\" Mills added.",
      "To be sure, whether Trump can respond to voters' most pressing economic issues isn't certain, especially if the House of Representatives flips to Democratic control, which could stymie his plans to extend tax cuts that were enacted in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA) as well as to enact other changes.",
      "Here are five ways Trump's policies could impact the economy and your money.",
      "Your money under Trump's tax plans",
      "The core of Trump's tax plan is to extend the provisions in the TCJA that are set to expire at the end of 2025. These include the law's lowered tax brackets and expanded standard deduction.",
      "Trump also wants to provide deeper tax cuts for some individuals and businesses, with his campaign proposing lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%. He's floated the idea of eliminating personal income taxes on many types of earnings, from tips to Social Security benefits, but has yet to offer details.",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts, would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "If Trump is able to enact these tax code changes, personal income taxes would decline for all income groups. But the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model (That research assesses Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.)",
      "That means a middle-class family with earnings of about $80,000 a year would get a tax break of about $1,740 in 2026, the analysis found. Top-earning households, with incomes of more than $14 million, would see their taxes reduced by $376,910, according to Penn Wharton.",
      "What could happen with inflation?",
      "Consumers rank inflation as one of their biggest economic concerns, with many still feeling impact of soaring prices during the pandemic. Although the U.S. inflation rate has now fallen close to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal, many Americans still describe it as high because prices haven't come down; rather, prices are simply rising more slowly than they did during the pandemic.",
      "Economists have cautioned that Trump's plans could reignite inflation. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by American consumers, rather than the countries that export goods to the U.S. On top of that, Trump's plan to deport millions of immigrants could also boost inflation as employers would likely face higher wages due to a labor crunch.",
      "\"Two main pillars of his policy proposals, tariffs and mass deportations, are likely to cause prices to rise as they will make it more difficult for businesses to produce goods,\" Jacob Channel, chief economist at LendingTree, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Trump's plan to levy a 10% tariff on all imports and 60% or more on Chinese goods shipped to the U.S. could add $1,700 a year in additional costs for a typical middle-class household, according to the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump's plans could boost the inflation rate by as much 1 percentage point, bringing it to an annual rate of about 3.4% \u2014 above the Fed's 2% goal \u2014 according to Andrzej Skiba of RBC Global Asset Management.",
      "\"If you add 1% to next year's inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts,\" Skiba said.",
      "Could the economy grow faster?",
      "The economy could initially grow slightly faster under Trump's plans to cut corporate taxes, but that impact could fade over time, especially due to the impact of deporting millions of immigrants, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Real GDP growth could be 0.3 percentage points higher in 2026 than if current economic policies continued, wrote Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a November 6 research note.",
      "But, he added, GDP growth could eventually fall to 0.6 percentage points lower in 2028 than earlier projections due to the impact of deportations and higher tariffs.",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Probably not, according to Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant.",
      "First, if Trump's plans reignite inflation as some economists are forecasting, the Federal Reserve may not continue lowering its benchmark rate. Without further cuts in borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, mortgage rates aren't likely to fall, she added.",
      "Second, deporting millions of undocumented immigrants could impact the housing sector \u2014 which already faces a severe shortage of homes \u2014 because it relies on these workers to build new homes, Sturtevant said.",
      "\"His mass deportation proposal would have a chilling effect on the construction industry, shrinking the already constrained labor force and stalling badly needed new housing construction,\" she said. \"At the same time, proposed tariffs will increase building costs.\"",
      "Will Trump's policies help your 401(k)?",
      "Possibly, given that Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts and support for lighter regulations on businesses, if enacted, could bolster company profits and lift the stock market.",
      "On Wednesday, indices including the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average,\u00a0soared on Wall Street optimism for stronger corporate growth.",
      "\"Lower corporate taxes and/or deregulation of the energy and financial sectors under a Trump administration could provide additional support,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Other financial instruments could also get a boost, including cryptocurrencies, due to Trump's pledge to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "At the same time, much of these forecasts depend on Trump pushing through changes to the tax code, regulations and other laws, Channel noted.",
      "\"Virtually all of these policies will be tough to implement, even with Republican control over the House, the Senate and the presidency,\" he said. \"With that in mind, we might not see much change at all in the broader economy.\"",
      "He added, \"Inaction from the next Trump administration could mean that the economy continues to chug along its current course.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it would seek to pull a widely used ingredient in cough and cold medicines from the market, after the agency's scientists concluded that the oral version of the drug is ineffective as a nasal decongestant.",
      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",
      "\"Based on our review of available data, and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant,\" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release.",
      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association said Thursday it was \"disappointed\" in the FDA's proposal.

      "The FDA's proposal caps a push by pharmacy professors at the University of Florida who have urged the agency for years to pull the product, pointing to new data showing phenylephrine did no better than a placebo when swallowed.",
      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",

    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

      "As President-elect Donald Trump readies to return to the Oval Office, U.S. retailers that depend on foreign suppliers are prepared to pass along the cost of his proposed import tariffs to consumers, potentially leading to higher prices for a range of products.",
      "Americans stand to lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods due to the new tariffs, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released Monday.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said\u00a0in a statement. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter.

      "For example, a $40 toaster oven would retail for $48 to $52 after the tariffs, while a $50 pair of running shoes would jump to to $59 to $64, according to the industry trade group. A $2,000 mattress and box spring set would cost $2,128 to $2,190, the NRF said.",
      "During President-elect Trump's first term in office, his administration imposed tariffs of up to 25% on more than $360 billion in products from China. President Joe Biden's White House kept most of those tariffs and added more onto goods including Chinese electric cars and microchips.",
      "Now, Trump has said he plans to impose a 60% tax on goods from China and a 10% to 20% levy on all of the $3 trillion in foreign goods the U.S. imports annually. Such sweeping tariffs would reignite inflation, as they would mostly be paid by U.S. consumers, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, offering a general view widely\u00a0shared by\u00a0other economists on both sides of the political aisle.",
      "\"A consistent theoretical and empirical finding in economics is that domestic consumers and domestic firms bear the burden of a tariff, not the foreign country,\" the nonpartisan Budget Lab at Yale University stated in an\u00a0analysis published in mid-October.",
      "Trump has repeatedly contended that foreign companies would foot the bill, telling a gathering last month at the Economic Club of Chicago that \"the countries will pay\" the tariffs. In reality, American importers pay the tariffs to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency when their goods cross the border.",
      "\"These policy steps would amount to regressive tax cuts, only partially paid for by regressive tax increases,\" and cost a typical middle-income household about $1,700 in increased taxes a year,\" according to economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The proposed tariffs would shift tax burdens from the well-off to lower-income Americans, the nonprofit also stated in a policy\u00a0brief\u00a0published in August.",
      "For now, it is unclear when the new Trump regime could seek to stiffen tariffs. The process to complete legislation required to raise the levies could take nearly a year, so any adverse impact might not be felt until 2026, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Harvard University professor and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers questioned the wisdom of taxing imports, noting the potential impact on prices. \"For parents, we're coming up on the holiday season and most of our toys are imported from China,\" Summers tweeted on Thanksgiving Day.",
      "Trump has argued that tariffs compel American companies to make goods on U.S. soil rather than purchasing from foreign suppliers.",
      "But some companies have other plans.",
      "\"If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer,\" Philip Daniele, CEO of vehicle parts supplier AutoZone,\u00a0told\u00a0Wall Street analysts in an earnings call in late September. \"We'll generally raise prices ahead of \u2014 we know what the tariffs will be \u2014 we generally raise prices ahead of that,\" Daniele said.",
      "Major suppliers to AutoZone include companies based in China, India and Germany, according to the company.",
      "Stanley Black & Decker CEO Donald Allan Jr.\u00a0said\u00a0last week his tool-producing company has been planning for the possibility of additional tariffs on imports since the spring. \"Obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we [would] put into the market.\"",
      "Allan downplayed the idea of moving manufacturing back to the U.S., saying it would not be cost-effective. The company's options could include \"moving production and aspects of the supply chain to different parts of the world,\" including from China to other parts of Asia and possibly Mexico, the executive said.",
      "Such a shift has already been made by Shelton, Connecticut-based Acme United, which now has its Westcott brand products like rulers made in Thailand and the Philippines, avoiding the tariffs targeting China, CEO Walter Johnsen said in an October earnings call.",
      "Acme has switched production of certain medical products to India, Egypt and U.S. plants in Florida, North Carolina and Washington state, the executive said.",
      "Businesses have also stocked up, placing bigger-than-usual import orders ahead of new tariffs taking hold, as the U.S. imported 11% more Chinese products in July and August than they did during the same two-month period a year ago, according to the Census Bureau.",

      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Rep. Michael Waltz, a Florida Republican, as his national security adviser, two sources familiar with the plans confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The national security adviser is a top aide to the president who plays a major role in foreign and national security policy decision-making. The role does not require Senate confirmation.",
      "Waltz, a Green Beret veteran who served multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa, was elected to Congress in 2018, replacing Ron DeSantis who had been elected Florida's governor.",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report that Trump had selected Waltz.",
      "Waltz, a China hawk, serves on the House China Task Force that seeks to develop solutions to address the Chinese Communist Party's influence.",
      "He has also been skeptical of giving more aid to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. He has said that the U.S. has \"leverage\" over both Ukraine and Russia to get them to the table to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "\"We have leverage, like taking the handcuffs off of the long-range weapons we provided Ukraine as well. And then, of course, I think we have plenty of leverage with Zelenskyy to get them to the table,\" he told NPR earlier this month.",
      "He served nearly three decades in the U.S. Army and National Guard, retiring from the military during his second term in Congress. He was awarded four Bronze Stars, including two for valor.",
      "Before his election to Congress, Waltz served in various roles at the Pentagon and White House, including as defense policy director for Secretaries of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates.",
      "Waltz's wife, Julia Nesheiwat, served as Trump's Homeland Security adviser in the last year of his first term. She has also served in various roles in the Bush and Obama administrations.",

McMaster\u00a0(now a CBS News contributor) was the first, and\u00a0Trump fired him\u00a0after 13 months. John Bolton replaced McMaster, and he lasted 17 months in the job before he was\u00a0also ousted\u00a0from the administration.

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 19:43:08 -0500",
    "summary": "Tom Homan, Trump's newly-named \"border czar,\" recently told CBS how he'd carry out a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.",
    "story": [
      "Tom Homan, tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to be his incoming administration's \"border czar,\" is a veteran immigration official and immigration hawk whose law enforcement career spans decades.",
      "Once a police officer in New York state and Border Patrol agent, the Obama administration tapped him to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch in 2013. During Homan's time at ICE under President Obama, the agency carried out record numbers of formal deportations. Obama gave Homan a Presidential Rank Award, the highest civil service recognition.",
      "Trump early in his first term named Homan acting director of ICE. He quickly generated controversy when he suggested undocumented immigrants \"should be afraid\" under the Trump administration.",
      "Homan was one of the masterminds of the first Trump administration's infamous \"zero tolerance\" policy, which led to the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents. The parents were prosecuted for illegal entry, while the children were sent to shelters for unaccompanied minors \u2014 without a plan to reunite them. He was one of the three officials who signed the policy memo that then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen approved to greenlight the separations. He left ICE in June 2018.",
      "During an interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" in October, Homan outlined how the U.S. government would carry out the largest deportation operation in American history, one of Trump's signature pledges on the campaign trail.",
      "\"It's not threatening to the immigrant community,\" Homan said of Trump's campaign promise. \"It should be threatening to the illegal immigrant community. But on the heels of [a] historic illegal immigration crisis. That has to be done.\"",
      "He suggested to CBS News correspondent Cecilia Vega that he would target criminals and national security threats first, and then seek to deport non-criminal migrants who are in the country illegally and are ordered deported. That would require reversing Biden administration rules that currently instruct ICE to focus on arresting and deporting serious criminals, national security threats and recent border crossers and that effectively shield undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for a long time without committing serious crimes from deportation.",
      "Homan also indicated he would revive large-scale immigration arrests at workplaces, which the Biden administration discontinued in 2021. \"That's gonna be necessary,\" he said of worksite immigration enforcement.",
      "But Homan said the deportation operation would not involve \"concentration camps\" or a \"mass sweep of neighborhoods.\"",
      "Asked if mass deportations could be carried out without separating families, Homan said, \"Of course there is. Families can be deported together.\" One study shows roughly 4 million U.S. citizen children live with an undocumented parent.",

    "story": [
      "Waves of U.S. Capitol riot defendants are citing Donald Trump's election in requests to delay their criminal prosecutions because of his public pledge to pardon some of the people convicted of crimes on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "In court filings reviewed by CBS News, defense attorneys asked federal judges in Washington, D.C., to postpone proceedings in some of the Jan. 6 cases until 2025, when President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "The filings complicate the Justice Department's ability to conclude its prosecutions \u2014 hundreds of which remain active \u2014 before the changeover in power.",
      "William Pope, a Jan. 6 defendant from Kansas, has filed a new request for a delay, blistering the Justice Department for continuing apace with his prosecution.\u00a0Pope's filing cited Trump's reelection, arguing, \"Any further action in these cases is not an 'administration of justice' in the public interest as the government claims, but a belligerent disregard for the will of the American people, from which all law and governmental power in this country is derived.\"",
      "In a new request to delay his sentencing, defendant Terry Allen's attorneys filed a motion saying, \"History has shown that President Donald Trump is not shy when it comes to exercising his pardon powers and there is clearly no reason to believe he won't do as he says.\" Allen's attorneys noted that in Trump's first term, he \"pardoned, commuted, or rescinded the convictions of 237 people,\" and \"[m]any were controversial.\"",
      "Some defendants are quoting Trump's campaign statements in their new court filings. Attorneys for defendant Larry Brock argued that Trump \"explicitly campaigned on justice for the January 6 defendants.\" They cited Trump's July 31 interview with the National Association of Black Journalists, in which he said he'd \"'absolutely' pardon those convicted in the January 6th prosecutions because 'they were convicted by a very tough system.'\" They also quoted Trump's claim about Jan. 6 convicts: \"'[S]ome call them prisoners. I call them hostages...release the J6 hostages, Joe. Release them, Joe. You can do it real easy, Joe.'\"",
      "Brock, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, was accused of rifling through papers on the desks of senators while amid the mob.",
      "Defense attorney Joseph McBride, who has defended several Jan. 6 criminal defendants told CBS News that requests would be made \"across the board\" to delay cases until Trump takes office. \"It would be foolish not to,\" he said. \"The Justice Department Is still arresting people, which is nuts and pointless. The pardon thing is looming. And I don't think any of these prosecutions will continue beyond (Trump taking office).\"",
      "Former federal prosecutor Scott Fredericksen told CBS News he thinks the Justice Department is going to be forced to confront the question of what to do with the cases.",
      "\"The department will probably say, 'We're going to continue with the cases,' and that the discussion of pardons is not sufficient to warrant delays,\" Fredricksen said.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately return requests for comment. In court filings, it has opposed requests for delays. In the case of Terry Allen, prosecutors disagreed that a continuance of the case was warranted because \"the defendant's justification at this time is mere speculation.\"",
      "\"The Court should proceed as it would in any other prosecution,\" prosecutors argued. \"Courts in this jurisdiction have denied similar motions.\"",
      "Opposing a request to delay the trial of defendant Stephen Baker, the Justice Department argued, \"There is a public interest in the prompt and efficient administration of justice. The government and the Court have endeavored to deliver that interest. The government disagrees that a continuance is warranted here, and the Court should proceed as it would in any other prosecution.\"",
      "But the numbers of delay requests are expected to grow significantly. McBride, the New York-based defense attorney, told CBS News requests are expected by all similarly situated defendants. He said defense attorneys must argue for all of their clients and may not \"pick and choose\" to ask for delays only for some.",
      "In his court filing, Pope included a photo of himself standing next to Trump.",
      "\"It is now up to the Court to decide if it wishes to expend judicial resources by enduring a taxing schedule in this case,\" the filing said. \"Ultimately, I will get the same result with a trial or with no trial.\"",
      "The Justice Department has launched over 1,500 criminal cases in its prosecution of the Capitol siege.\u00a0 According to federal records, approximately 950 defendants have pleaded guilty, and 200 more have been found guilty at trial.",
      "Arrests continue, including new cases unsealed over the past few weeks.",
      "Fredericksen said a Trump-appointed attorney general could move to have the department dismiss pending Jan. 6 cases \u2014 and could opt to reopen and dismiss cases against those who have already been convicted and sentenced to prison.",

    "summary": "Trump campaign co-chair Susie Wiles will serve as White House chief of staff, the first woman \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 ever to hold that position.",
    "story": [
      "Last week,\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0announced his campaign co-chair Susie Wiles will serve as his White House chief of staff, the first woman \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 ever to hold that position. Calling her \"tough, smart, innovative..., universally admired and respected,\" Trump credited her with helping him win both the 2024 and 2016 elections.",
      "Behind the scenes",
      "Wiles is known as a formidable political operative who prefers to work behind the scenes, rather than on any stage \u2014 or in front of cameras. In keeping with that, when Trump\u00a0declared victory\u00a0in the early hours of last Wednesday morning, he invited her to come to the microphones, but she politely declined.",
      "She's managed to not just curry favor, but more critically, to remain in good standing with Trump, winning his trust while working in a high-profile campaign role, managing the ambitions, personalities and egos in Trump's orbit.",
      "Relationship with campaign staff",
      "Wiles is beloved by the Trump campaign staff, many of whom call her a mentor.",
      "\"Susie Wiles is a tremendous advocate for President Trump and a great boss to those that work for her,\" said Trump senior adviser Danielle Alvarez. \"She knows how to bring people together.\"",
      "\"For myself and countless others, having Susie Wiles as a mentor and a friend is a gift,\" said Brian Hughes, another senior adviser. \"The nation will see that with President Trump in the White House with Susie as the COS the next four years will be America's best.\"",
      "Those who have worked for Wiles \"will take a bullet for Susie,\" said Carlos Trujillo, a campaign adviser who served as U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States. Trujillo said most people don't see Wiles' motherly and grandmotherly side. \"She always made sure her people were taken care of,\" he said. \"She's very soft spoken, but she holds everyone accountable, and it's always done through love and kindness but never a place of hate.\"",
      "Management style",
      "Staffers say Wiles runs a tight and focused ship. Trump's 2024 campaign did not go through the big, dramatic shakeups or infighting that characterized his previous campaigns. Wiles' appointment signals that as president-elect, he wants to run his administration in a similar way.",
      "Wiles' legacy, Trujillo said, is her ability to cultivate talent. \"Susie in politics is the greatest coach of all time...she's going to be able to recruit the best talent.\"",
      "And while Wiles shies away from the spotlight, she made a rare comment on X when businessman Mark Cuban, in an interview on ABC's \"The View,\" accused Trump of not associating with \"strong, intelligent women.\" In response, Wiles\u00a0posted\u00a0for the first time this year: \"I'm told [Mark Cuban] needs help identifying the strong and intelligent women surrounding Pres. Trump. Well, here we are!\"",
      "Background",
      "After Trump won the 2016 election, Wiles, who was the chief strategist in Florida for his campaign, was dispatched in late September of 2018 to help Ron DeSantis with his 2018 bid to be Florida governor. At the time, he was trailing Democrat Andrew Gillum in several polls.",
      "After helping DeSantis win, however, Wiles was shut out of his inner circle, according to\u00a0The Atlantic's Tim Alberta. Wiles told Alberta that working for DeSantis was the \"biggest mistake\" of her career. She returned to the Trump campaign and ran his Florida campaign in 2020, and then after his loss, she went on to run Trump's Save America PAC.",
      "As Trump's 2024 co-campaign manager, Wiles, along with Chris LaCivita, hatched a plan to recruit, register and turn out Trump's low-propensity voters, Alberta reported. During the primary campaign, they pursued people in the reddest areas of the country who liked Trump but weren't habitual voters and in many cases, weren't even registered to vote. During the general campaign, Wiles and LaCivita raised a volunteer army to take on the legions of canvassers paid by Kamala Harris' cash-rich coffers.",
      "Wiles is a native of New Jersey, the daughter of renowned the late NFL kicker and sportscaster Pat Summerall. Soon after she graduated from college at the University of Maryland, she worked for Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign, and later went on to work in Florida politics. In 2010, she helped Sen. Rick Scott win his election against Democrat Bill McCollum, and she has also been a political consultant in Florida.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday that he's appointing a \"border czar,\" former Immigrations and Customs Enforcement director and immigration hardliner Tom Homan, to join his administration. Homan, however, may not be the only such \"czar\" in the Trump administration.",
      "\"I am pleased to announce that the Former ICE Director, and stalwart on Border Control, Tom Homan, will be joining the Trump Administration, in charge of our Nation's Borders (\"The Border Czar\"), including, but not limited to, the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The term \"czar\" is shorthand for a high-level executive branch official in charge of a specific policy focus.",
      "They aren't Senate-confirmed positions",
      "The \"czar\" role is one that allows a president to step over the pesky checks and balances of the three branches of government. \"Czar\" roles aren't Senate-confirmed cabinet positions, like say, the secretary of state or Health and Human Services secretary. That means a president can appoint that person to his administration without the Senate's input, and quickly.",
      "Trump wants to put his people in place, and quickly, after experiencing in his first term how congressional authority can gum up an administration's plans. Trump said as much in a social media post on Sunday.",
      "\"Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more,\" Trump wrote Sunday, saying he wants recess appointments. \"This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again. We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\"",
      "Trump wouldn't be the first president to use \"czars\"",
      "Trump would not be the first president to use \"czars.\" Such czars have been appointed by presidents of both parties. Former President Barack Obama had, in part, an \"energy and environment czar,\" \"Afghanistan czar,\" \"car czar,\" \"health czar\" and \"auto recovery czar.\"",
      "His use of these positions was so widespread that in 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the history and legality of executive branch czars. The committee noted that some of these policy czars were at one point confirmed by the Senate, while others were in positions outside the White House that reported to a Senate-confirmed officer. But a handful worked in the White House. The use of such \"czars\" ignited a firestorm of criticism from Republicans, and even some Democrats raised concerns about their authority.",
      "But presidents before Obama had \"czars,\" too. President Bill Clinton had a \"Y2K czar,\" and President George W. Bush had an \"AIDS czar,\" \"counterterrorism czar\" and \"reading czar,\" among others. Historians believe the role dates back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, who rapidly expanded the size and role of the federal government.",
      "Trump also had something of a \"czar\" in his first term. Moncef Slaoui, a former pharmaceutical executive, oversaw Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's initiative to fast-track COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "During the Obama administration, Republicans blasted the growth of the administrative state, and decisions made by unelected bureaucrats. And during the Trump administration, Trump supporters bemoaned the so-called \"deep state\" of unelected career officers.",
      "Vice President Harris was sometimes dubbed a \"border czar,\" although not by President Biden himself, since the president tasked her with tackling the influx of migrants at the southern border. Harris fought against that label as the Democratic nominee.",
      "A \"czar\" position could make room for controversial names like RFK, Jr.",
      "The Senate will be controlled by Republicans when Trump takes office. But Trump still may have trouble confirming a few of the most controversial names, like vaccine denier Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to Senate-confirmed Cabinet positions.",
      "Kennedy\u00a0is on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the\u00a0president-elect's\u00a0campaign said. But it's also possible Kennedy could serve in a less formal role, like a \"czar.\"",
      "Where did the concept of \"czars\" originate?",
      "\"Czar\" comes from the Russian word \"tsar,\" which is derived from the Latin word \"caesar,\" according to World History Encyclopedia. Specifically, the term tsar refers to Russia's rulers for hundreds of years. Ivan IV The Terrible was formally crowned the \"tsar of all Russia\" in 1547, and the title continued until Russia's monarchy was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917.",
      "Franklin D. Roosevelt, who greatly expanded the size and scope of the federal government, used \"czars.\" But even before his time in office, the first use of the phrase \"czar\" in the U.S. was likely Nicholas Biddle, tapped to be president of the Bank of the United States during Andrew Jackson's presidency. He was sometimes called \"Czar Nicholas,\" which overlapped with Russia's Czar Nicholas I's reign.",
      "Over time, the term in U.S. came to be used informally for people handpicked by the president for principal positions who don't undergo Senate vetting, scrutiny or confirmation.",
      "What are the pros and cons of \"czars\"?",
      "Critics of such roles have argued \"czars\" run amock of the checks and balances system the forefathers founded. The late Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd criticized both Obama and Bush for creating such roles in their administrations.",
      "\"The rapid and easy accumulation of power by White House staff can threaten the Constitutional system of checks and balances,\" Byrd wrote in a publicized letter to Obama in 2009. \"At the worst, White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.\"",
      "The president can, of course, appoint White House employees. The constitutional issues come into question when the president selects a principal who isn't Senate-confirmed.",
      "But for a president looking to appoint an ally quickly, a \"czar\" is logistically much easier to get into office than is a Cabinet secretary.",
      "How effective a \"czar\" can really be is up for debate \u2014 especially since \"czars\" generally don't control budgets.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Senate Republicans prepare to vote Wednesday on new leadership for the upcoming Congress, President-elect Donald Trump is already weighing in with demands for the new majority leader regarding his Cabinet.",
      "After a decisive victory in the 2024 elections, Trump is returning to the White House with a GOP-led Senate at his side. Senate Republican leaders are expected to ease the way for the president-elect's agenda and his Cabinet and judicial nominees. Trump has made it clear that he'd like his nominees to be installed immediately, suggesting that he may want the option to bypass the Senate's advice and consent role entirely.",
      "Trump weighs in on recess appointments",
      "Perhaps the biggest factor remaining in the leadership race is whether Trump himself weighs in on the candidates. On Sunday, he stepped into the conversation, demanding in a Truth Social post that anyone seeking the position as leader \"must agree to Recess Appointments.\"",
      "Recess appointments enable a president to temporarily install nominees without the Senate confirmation process. Trump argued in a post on social media that without recess appointments, \"we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner.\"",
      "\"We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\" the president-elect said.",
      "The Constitution's Recess Appointment Clause grants presidents the ability to \"fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate.\" The maneuver is considered to be a way to make swift appointments during the Senate's absence, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service, which notes that recess appointments have also been used for political reasons \u2014 for instance, to make an appointment on a temporary basis for an individual who would not be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "With a GOP majority of at least 52 seats, Trump shouldn't have too much difficulty getting his nominations through the chamber through the regular process. But pushback from a handful of Republicans like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Todd Young of Indiana or Sen.-elect John Curtis of Utah could imperil some of his more controversial picks. The process could also be delayed by Democrats in the minority, who could rely on procedural maneuvers to extend the time it takes for Trump's Cabinet to be confirmed.",
      "But the recess appointment maneuver is a controversial one that both parties have combated in recent years. Recess appointments are allowed only when the Senate is out of session for 10 days. For the last decade, both chambers have headed off recess appointments by going into pro-forma sessions even when lawmakers are in recess. And a Supreme Court decision in 2014 gave the Senate more authority to prevent the maneuver, after controversial recess appointments by President Barack Obama.",
      "If Trump were to make an appointment during a recess in the first session of the new Congress, the appointment could last for almost two years, after which the individual could be appointed again through a recess appointment or the regular process, according to the CRS report. But without the Senate's approval, the appointee would not be paid.",
      "Should Republicans force a change to procedure in the upper chamber, they would do so with the risk that Democrats will take the same steps in their favor when they regain the majority. Still, all three candidates for GOP leader threw their support behind Trump's demand for recess appointments on Sunday.",
      "The candidates for Senate majority leader",
      "Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, are considered the front-runners in the race to replace Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. But Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has seen a surge of support from members of Trump's orbit \u2014 from Tucker Carlson to Elon Musk \u2014 that has drawn increased attention to the race.",
      "Thune, 63, is currently the No. 2 Republican and considered by some to be the favorite in the race. He's been in the Senate since 2004 and served as GOP whip since 2021. But he hasn't always had a strong relationship with Trump, and initially backed Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina for president in the GOP primaries.",
      "Cornyn, 72, has been in the Senate since 2002 and previously served as the Republican whip from 2013 to 2019. His fundraising chops have made him a top candidate in the Senate leadership race. But like Thune, he's previously distanced himself from Trump \u2014 a gap both senators have sought to close in recent months.",
      "Meanwhile, Scott has been angling for the position. The Florida Republican challenged McConnell for the role after the midterm elections in 2022, when he earned the support of just 10 members of his conference. Scott is similarly expected to find support from some of the conference's conservative members in this year's contest, and the outside endorsements from those who claim Cornyn and Thune are too close to McConnell could be a boon.",
      "Electing the \"next generation of leadership\"",
      "The leadership election comes after McConnell's decision to step away after 17 years at the helm, becoming the longest serving Senate leader in history.",
      "McConnell's decision to step aside and welcome \"the next generation of leadership\" teed up a high-stakes race for leader that has been shaking out behind the scenes since February. After Republicans flipped the Senate, the leadership race took on even greater importance.",
      "\"I had really hoped I'd be able to hand over to my successor the majority,\" McConnell told reporters at a news conference last week. \"I've been the majority leader, I've been the minority leader \u2013 majority's a lot better.\"",
      "Outside influence and endorsements",
      "The race, nine months in the making, has begun to draw input from outsiders in recent days. Tucker Carlson, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are among the Trump loyalists who have weighed in to back Scott, urging that he is best suited to carry out the president-elect's agenda.",
      "How the input from prominent outsiders weighs on the race remains to be seen. Senate Republicans will meet behind closed doors to elect the new leader, casting secret ballots, which make senators less likely to be swayed by external pressures.",
      "For months, the three candidates have been working behind the scenes to persuade their colleagues to back them for the chamber's top post. And so far, just a small portion of the Republican conference has shared publicly who they plan to support.",
      "Thune has the backing of Sens. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, along with Steve Daines of Montana, who chaired the GOP campaign arm, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, this cycle and may have valuable sway with new members whose races he buoyed. Meanwhile, Cornyn has the support of Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. And Scott has the backing of Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. In recent days, he also earned endorsements from Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee \u2014 two senators who have been floated as possible picks for Trump's cabinet.",
      "The bulk of the conference has yet to weigh in publicly, and likely won't be swayed by outsiders on a decision that will guide how the chamber operates for the next two years. But an endorsement of a candidate from Trump himself, who will work with the leader going forward, could change the dynamic.",
      "Whether Trump endorses a particular candidate remains to be seen. Thune acknowledged on CNBC last week that Trump can \"exert a considerable amount of influence\" on the leadership race, but he cautioned him against doing so, saying, \"I think my preference would be, and I think it's in his best interest, to stay out of that.\"",
      "\"He's got to work with all of us when it's all said and done,\" Thune said. \"But whatever he decides to do, that's going to be his prerogative, as we know.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump will nominate New York Rep. Elise Stefanik to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, tapping a key House ally to join his administration.",
      "Stefanik, 40, has been one of Trump's most vocal defenders in Congress. She's likely to be confirmed by the new, GOP-led Senate when the president-elect takes office in January, which will set up a race not only to fill Stefanik's seat in the lower chamber, but also to succeed her as chair of the Republican conference.",
      "\"I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,\" Trump said in a statement to CBS News. \"Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter.\"",
      "Here is what to know about the New York Republican.",
      "Stefanik's record in Congress",
      "Stefanik was elected to represent New York's 21st Congressional District in 2014 and at the age of 30, became the youngest woman elected to Congress. Currently in her fifth term, she cruised to reelection in November, defeating Democrat Paula Collins with more than 62% of the vote.",
      "Stefanik serves on the Armed Services, Education and Workforce, and Intelligence Committees. She also is a member of the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, which was created in 2023 when Republicans took control of the House. The weaponization panel was a nod to what many Republicans believed was federal investigators' unfair treatment of Trump.",
      "The New York Republican is the highest-ranking woman in the House, serving in leadership as the GOP conference chair. She replaced former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming in the post after Cheney was ousted for her criticisms of Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Stefanik has been one of Trump's staunchest defenders in the House, having emerged as a crucial ally during his first impeachment proceedings in 2019. She also introduced a nonbinding resolution last year that sought to \"expunge\" both of Trump's impeachments by the House.",
      "During this Congress, Stefanik made headlines for her grilling of university presidents during a hearing about their response to antisemitic incidents following the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks on Israel by Hamas. The presidents of Harvard, Stefanik's alma mater, and the University of Pennsylvania resigned following the hearing.",
      "While Stefanik supported earlier packages sending assistance to Ukraine, she voted against a plan to send $60.8 billion to aid Ukraine in its war against Russia in April.",
      "Stefanik and the 2020 election",
      "The congresswoman was among a group of more than 100 House Republicans who signed onto a friend-of-the-court brief filed with the Supreme Court after the 2020 election in a longshot bid to overturn the election results in four battleground states. She also joined GOP lawmakers in objecting to certifying Pennsylvania's election results.",
      "\"Tens of millions of Americans are concerned that the 2020 election featured unconstitutional overreach by unelected officials and judges, ignoring state election laws,\" Stefanik said during a speech on the House floor after the Capitol attack. \"We can and we should peacefully discuss these concerns.\"",
      "But the congresswoman also condemned the violence of Jan. 6 during the same speech, calling it a \"truly tragic day\" for the country.",
      "\"We all join together in fully condemning the dangerous violence and destruction that occurred today in our nation's Capitol,\" she said. \"Americans will always have the freedom of speech and the Constitutional right to protest, but violence in any form is absolutely unacceptable, it is anti-American, and must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Stefanik would not commit to certifying the results of the election, telling NBC News in January it would depend on whether \"this is a legal and valid election.\"",
      "Stefanik before Congress",
      "Stefanik graduated from Harvard University and worked in the White House for President George W. Bush on the Domestic Policy Council and in the chief of staff's office. She also was an adviser to former House Speaker Paul Ryan during the 2012 presidential campaign, when he was the Republican vice presidential nominee.",

    "story": [
      "Lateefah Simon is a widowed mom who is taking a new job, moving her 13-year-old to a new school. She was born legally blind and her life is about to go through some further upheaval.",
      "When asked what worries her most, Simon paused for a moment, then took a deep breath. Simon answered, \"I will do whatever I can so that my eighth grader finishes her science homework. And, God bless, try to help her pass that French class too.\"",
      "Simon, 48, arrives in Washington Monday for orientation sessions near Capitol Hill having been elected as the new U.S. Congresswoman representing California's 12th District, which includes Oakland and Berkley.",
      "Simon, who counts Vice President Kamala Harris as a close mentor, served as a civil rights attorney and helped the victims of sex trafficking, will be sworn into office with the 119th Congress on Jan. 3, 2025.",
      "Simon is arriving in a Washington that is transfixed by the return of President-elect Donald Trump, his outsized personality and his pledges to overhaul the government and secure retribution against political enemies.",
      "But Simon and some of her new colleagues do not intend to go unnoticed \u2014 no matter which party controls the Congress or the White House.",
      "With her vision impaired, Simon has relied on public transportation and has a history of advocating to make mass transit more accessible to low-income people. She is embracing the opportunity to succeed Rep. Barbara Lee, a longtime progressive fixture in Washington who left office to pursue an unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic party's nomination for U.S. Senate in California in 2024.",
      "Speaking to CBS News by phone while preparing for her first trip to Washington as an elected congresswoman, Simon said she first must rebound from Harris's defeat in the Presidential race. \"I'm devastated. My mentor was the President we deserved. But Kamala would always say: 'Head up, roll up your sleeves, get to work.' So that's what I intend to do.\"",
      "Simon said she'll pursue roles with the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, considering her background championing issues of mass transportation, and will seek out early leadership roles.",
      "Simon told CBS News it is important that there is diversity among the members of key panels. \"We must defend the values of not just our party, but the people of the United States, particularly me, as disabled people,\" she said. \"Also the elders, the folks who are seeking health care, queer kids. I have work to do.\"",
      "Simon and the dozens of others who were newly-elected to Congress on Tuesday face a more immediate hurdle:\u00a0 A tidal wave of life changes.",
      "For Simon, that includes moving her daughter to a new community midyear.",
      "\"As long as my seat is on the floor... I won't complain\"",
      "For Tom Barrett, a military veteran who won a competitive race for a vacated seat in the Michigan 7th Congressional District, it has been impossible to simply open all of the text messages.",
      "Barrett told CBS News, \"I can't even tell you how many phone calls I've received in the last couple of days. I probably received 1,000 text messages just on election night. I haven't read them all.\"",
      "Barrett, a Michigan state senator from the Lansing area, bested a Democratic challenger in one of the most heated and expensive House races in the Midwest. Barrett said he is hesitant to make any demands of his new colleagues.",
      "\"I joked to House Speaker Mike Johnson that as long as my seat is on the floor \u2014 and not in the upper Gallery \u2014 I won't complain,\" Barrett said.",
      "\"I recognize that it is a significant job that has a lot of responsibility,\" Barrett said.",
      "But he appears poised to work comfortably in a Trump-dominated Washington. When asked for his top legislative and leadership priorities, Barrett uncorked a response that name-checked Trump six times.",
      "Barrett spoke of \"extending a lot of the provisions of the Trump tax cuts,\" \"Helping the Trump Administration stem the flow of people over the border\" and restoring prior \"Trump policies.\"",
      "Barrett served as a helicopter pilot in the U.S. Army in the Iraq War and said he'd be interested in a seat on the\u00a0 House Committee on Armed Services. But in the meantime, the Eaton County, Michigan, resident must find a different flight plan. He is spending time seeking the best weekly plan to trek by air to Washington, D.C. from either Lansing, Grand Rapids or Detroit.",
      "\"He's getting an apple juice; I'm getting a beer\"",
      "After an exhausting campaign in which he and his campaign volunteers touted that they knocked on 200,000 doors, Democrat Josh Riley said he was looking forward to one quiet, post-election night with his 4-year-old son.",
      "\"He's getting an apple juice, I'm getting a beer and we're going to watch a Cornell hockey game,\" Riley said.",
      "Riley won one of the most expensive House races in the nation, defeating first-term Republican Marc Molinaro in an 11-county swath of upstate New York, spanning from Cooperstown to Binghamton and the distant New York City exurbs.",
      "Arriving at a tumultuous moment in Washington, Riley said he will not try to compete with Trump or his powerful colleagues for a spotlight.\u00a0 Riley told CBS News, \"I'm not searching for a way to stand out. If I do this job successfully, people in upstate New York will have more job opportunities and good wages.\"",
      "Riley said he will take office with a high priority issue:\u00a0 Housing prices. \"One of the things I'd like to do,\" Riley said, \"Is stop the predatory practice of Wall Street entities running around upstate New York, gobbling up our single family homes and using them to extract profits. Housing should be looked at as a civil right, not as a driver of profits.\"",
      "Riley, an attorney and former congressional aide, acknowledged his two-year term is expected to be spent in the minority party in the House. But with narrow margins, Riley talked of exploring joining a New York Republican's proposal for housing affordability.",
      "\"Eight firehoses\"",
      "Rob Bresnahan laughed a bit when he said, \"I'm drinking out of nothing less than eight firehoses right now.\"",
      "Bresnahan is getting his first taste of elected office, but beginning in the big leagues.",
      "\"It's starting to feel slightly more real,\" Bresnahan told CBS News, \"I never thought a kid from Butler Street in Wyoming, Pennsylvania would now be a member of Congress. I mean, it's, it's incredible.\"",
      "Bresnahan edged a veteran House Democrat to secure the seat representing the Scranton area of Pennsylvania. He leads an electrical and construction business, while also working in real estate development.\u00a0 His introduction to politics included an unexpected stress: Bresnahan said his fianc\u00e9e, a local television news anchor, worked as the same broadcast outlet on which his opponent aired attack ads against him.",
      "\"I give her so much credit for being able to, you know, watch the horrible things that were being said about me,\" Breshnahan said.",
      "Bresnahan was one of two Republicans to oust Democratic House incumbents in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Those victories gave Republicans an edge in securing a majority control of the House, which could turbocharge Trump's legislative agenda in 2025.",
      "Bresnahan told CBS News he'd seek a seat on the House's Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.",
      "\"I understand the significance of infrastructure and transportation, outside of traditional roads and bridges,\" he said. \"Airports, levies, ports, freight rail and power distribution systems and sewer systems, that is the foundation and the hierarchy of needs of a society. I really think I can make a tangible difference with just my history of what I've done.\"",
      "\"If you change something and it's unpalatable to the other side, they're just going to come and kick it out next time\"",
      "Ryan Mackenzie will arrive in Washington with a 7-month-old son, who was born just days before Mackenzie won the primary to secure the Republican nomination in Pennsylvania's 7th Congressional District, in the Allentown area.",
      "And Mackenzie will be bringing a rescue dog too.",
      "Mackenzie told CBS News that he and his wife \"are going to be loading up the SUV and going down and trying to find an apartment.\"",
      "But the new work begins quickly.",
      "Mackenzie said it is vital for Congress to move swiftly on the issues of inflation and border security championed by candidates, including Trump.",
      "After toppling incumbent Democrat Susan Wild in a heated battleground race that captured the attention of both parties, Mackenzie argued that bipartisan efforts hold the most promise of big change.",
      "\"If you want lasting change, you have to do it in a bipartisan fashion,\" he said. \"If you change something and it's unpalatable to the other side, they're just going to come and kick it out next time. And then the pendulum swings back and forth.\"",
      "Mackenzie, 42, is one of dozens of Members of Congress-elect who will represent politically-purple congressional districts, in which the opposing party is likely to muster a well-funded challenger in 2026.",
      "He will begin his new job, with an immediate potential political target on his back. \tMackenzie said his successful challenge to Wild was an expensive and grueling battle.",
      "\"In a close and competitive district, it was never going to be a blowout,\" he said. \"That's not the reality of this district. So we always knew it was going to be close, always competitive.\"",
      "Mackenzie has served in the Pennsylvania state legislature, focusing on financial services and banking issues, and would seek similar committee work next year in the House. The House Ways and Means Committee and Financial Services Committee are expected to play outsized roles, as Trump pursues new tax cuts, tariffs and campaign pledges to tackle inflation.",
      "\"National conversation about Trump-this and Trump-that\"",
      "Kristen McDonald Rivet capped her victorious election week with a Friday trek to a cellphone store. Her 15-year-old son needed a cellphone repair, which was joking referred to as a \"national emergency.\"",
      "The mother of six already repaired some of the damage her party suffered Tuesday. McDonald Rivet, a state legislator in Michigan, won a competitive race for Michigan's 8th Congressional District in the Flint area. Trump prevailed in the 8th Congressional District and Democrats worried about their prospects there, because of the retirement of longtime Democratic Representative Dan Kildee, the latest in a family dynasty that's held the seat for decades.",
      "\"Here's the thing: My district voted for Donald Trump,\" McDonald Rivet told CBS News by phone, after returning from the cellphone store repair mission. \"There is a lot of national conversation about Trump-this and Trump-that.\u00a0 When we're working on things like prescription drugs, the cost of housing and lowering the cost of groceries, then I'm on board.I'm not going to get involved in the yelling and screaming and the stuff that makes politics awful.\"",
      "She paused a moment, relating to CBS News that it really is striking just how many groceries a 15-year-old son can consume. (She correctly fact-checked that the CBS News reporter's 14-year-old son was also prodigious at eating high volumes of food)",
      "McDonald Rivet arrives in Washington with years of experience in Michigan's state legislature in Lansing. \u00a0 \"I've spent my life working on issues, like creating economic security for families, particularly for kids. \u00a0 I started my career in Head Start.\u00a0 These issues are top of mind, including expansion of the child tax credit.\"",
      "119th Congress",
      "The group of newly-elected US House members arrives at a generally unstable moment in Washington, but amid a rare spec of stability in the lower chamber. Leadership of House Republicans and House Democrats is expected to remain unscathed, after an expensive and heated election in which the margins in the House could emerge unchanged.",
      "Orientation sessions for new members of the House begin this week near Capitol Hill, with some of the newly-elected seeking living quarters and training sessions for their unique new jobs.",
      "Several of those who spoke with CBS News said they have spent their first days as an elected federal official working to find staff and constituent service experts.",
      "Bresnahan, the incoming freshman Representative from northeast Pennsylvania, is among those who must wind down \u2014 or find contingency plans \u2013 for private businesses back home. \"I'm also a real estate developer and am trying to figure out, y'know, who is going to assume my role here,\" he said.",
      "Bresnahan also has a post on the local SPCA board in Pennsylvania to navigate, as he simultaneously tries to learn to navigate the winding hallways and tunnels of Capitol Hill.",
      "As for Simon, who says she is shifting her daughter to a new school in advance of beginning a term in Congress, the juggling of her new career is already well underway. As a single mom, she's bearing an additional burden.",
      "Simon paused a few moments in silence, then told CBS News, \"Here's the deal:\u00a0 It's going to be a tough job. But there are single mothers who are barely making minimum wage. And they are making ends meet barely. I will figure it out.\"",

      "First, votes are confirmed, to make sure that all valid votes are counted. This stage involves reconciling the number of mail, early, overseas and Election Day ballots cast with the number of registered voters \u2014 a process also known as canvassing. Many states also do a post-election audit to verify that voting equipment used during the election counted the votes correctly.

      "\"I am pleased to announce that the Former ICE Director, and stalwart on Border Control, Tom Homan, will be joining the Trump Administration, in charge of our Nation's Borders,\" he wrote late Sunday on his Truth Social site.",

      "He says he had \"no doubt\" Homan \"will do a fantastic, and long awaited for, job.\"",
      "Such a role does not require Senate confirmation.",
      "In an interview on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Homan said the military wouldn't be rounding up and arresting immigrants in the country illegally and that ICE would move to implement Trump's plans in a \"humane manner.\"",
      "\"It's going to be a well-targeted, planned operation conducted by the men of ICE. The men and women of ICE do this daily. They're good at it,\" he said. \"When we go out there, we're going to know who we're looking for. We most likely know where they're going to be, and it's going to be done in a humane manner.\"",
      "On \"60 Minutes\" on Oct. 27, 2024, nine days before the election, Homan defended what at the time was candidate Trump's vow to institute a mass deportation plan.",

    "story": [
      "Nogales, Mexico \u2014 Ivan Castro Santos, his wife and their four children, including 1-year-old triplets, have been living in a crowded room over the past four months, waiting for an opportunity to enter the U.S.",
      "The young family traveled from southern Mexico to the House of Mercy and All Nations shelter in the northern Mexican border city of Nogales, joining other migrants from across Latin America. Half of them are children. All of them have one objective: finding work and safety in the U.S.",
      "Castro Santos, 22, said he and his wife, Fatima Gonzalez Hernandez, 19, decided to leave Guerrero, Mexico, because of \"the crime and the risk to the children\" there. \"To protect them,\" he added in Spanish, looking at his young children.",
      "Tens of thousands of migrants are estimated to be in Mexico, hoping to enter America, including through a program that allows them to use a smartphone app to request a time to be vetted, processed and admitted by American border officials. The system was established by the Biden administration to dissuade migrants from crossing the border illegally, but many are now worried that President-elect Donald Trump will make it much harder for them to make it into the U.S. at all.",
      "Castro Santos said he's worried about Trump \"canceling the appointments\" offered by the U.S. government app, known as CBP One. \"We don't want to run that risk of going back and putting them at risk,\" he said, referring to his children. If allowed into the U.S., he said his family would like to settle in Houston, where his sister lives. He said he would like to learn how to cook and work in a restaurant.",
      "Trump made tackling illegal immigration a central theme of his campaign, running on a platform of mass deportations, harsher asylum rules and a reversal of the Biden administration's border policies, including the app-powered entry system used by migrants in Mexico. His immigration promises appealed to many American voters, polls show, including those living near the southern border.",
      "Anna Parada, who was born and raised in Nogales, Arizona, just miles away from the border with Mexico, said the \"main\" reason she voted for Trump was because of his stance on immigration.",
      "\"I really saw the Biden administration being a little bit too lax on immigration,\" Parada said. \"And having Trump back in office, I believe it's going to be a difference again.\"",
      "On the Mexican side of the border, the reaction to Trump winning was dramatically different.",
      "Luz Angela, a migrant from Bolivia, said she felt \"scared\" when she learned American voters had elected Trump.",
      "\"I felt scared because he promised in his speeches that they would deport all the migrants,\" Angela said in Spanish. \"And that he would close the CBP One application.\"",
      "A doctor by trade, Angela said she and her 9-year-old son, Matias, fled political persecution in Bolivia. She said she was targeted by the government there after complaining about corruption in the hospital where she worked.",
      "Angela and her son have been waiting for a CBP One appointment for nearly 7 months since arriving in Nogales, Mexico. During her wait, she has volunteered as a doctor at the House of Mercy and All Nations shelter, treating fellow migrants.",
      "\"What we're looking for is for an opportunity to improve our lives but also perhaps improve the health care system over there,\" she said. \"I really like helping people who don't have easy access to healthcare.\"",
      "U.S. officials worry that Trump's election will end the months-long lull in illegal border crossings, which plunged this year following an aggressive effort by Mexican officials to interdict migrants and President Biden's move in June to make most of those crossing into the country illegally ineligible for asylum. Larger numbers of migrants, officials have said, could be incentivized to cross into the U.S. unlawfully in the coming weeks, before Trump takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Alba Jaramillo, a Tucson-based immigration attorney, said Trump's win and the potential end to the CBP One system, could prompt more migrants to cross the southern border without authorization, including along dangerous parts of the Arizona desert where some perish trying to make it into the U.S.",
      "\"They're desperate,\" said Jaramillo, the co-executive director of the Immigration Law and Justice Network, a pro-immigrant organization. \"I mean they have given up everything to come to the north.\"",

    "summary": "Rep. Ro Khanna said Democrats \"need to be emphasizing the economic issues\" after bruising defeats in the 2024 election.",
    "story": [
      "Rep. Ro Khanna said Democrats \"need to be emphasizing the economic issues\" in the wake of the 2024 election, which delivered bruising blows to the party \u2014 and prompted a reckoning on the path forward.",
      "\"We did not have a compelling enough economic vision,\" Khanna, a California Democrat, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President-elect Donald Trump won a decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris last week, as the Democrats lost support from key demographic groups from the 2020 election. Khanna, a member of the party's progressive wing, attributed the fracturing among the Democratic coalition to the shortcomings in the party's economic message.",
      "\"The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans,\" Khanna said. \"Not just working-class Americans \u2014 a large slice of Americans who feel the American Dream has slipped away for their families and their kids.\"",
      "Khanna said new voices in Congress, like Reps. Pat Ryan, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Chris Deluzio, have encouraged that Democrats need to tell a \"better economic story,\" emphasizing a vision of raising the minimum wage, addressing child care and building new factories.",
      "\"I think that can unify our party \u2014 moderates and progressives \u2014 and it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, Black voters, White working class voters,\" Khanna said. \"And we have a better vision than Donald Trump on that.\"",
      "In the days since the election, some Democrats have expressed that the economic message should have been front and center in the campaign, while arguing that the party had a focus on identity politics. But Khanna said that while he's been clear on the importance of economic issues, \"I don't think we should run away\" from issues like standing up for transgender rights and equal rights.",
      "Khanna urged Democrats not to \"shy away from your convictions,\" adding that with the issues, along with a focus on the economy, the party can still be successful.",
      "\"I think we can win over people, even if they may not agree with us on a particular social issue,\" Khanna said.",
      "In Michigan, Harris lost key support in Arab American areas amid Israel's war in Gaza. Khanna said he believes that Harris would have won Michigan \"if there was more of a reckoning with the failures of policy on Gaza.\" He added that he has seen that even \"beyond Michigan, this really was a concern for a lot of young people and a lot of progressives.\"",
      "Amid the hand wringing over the election, Democrats have also pointed to President Biden's late decision to leave the race and endorse Harris, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Khanna said while he has a \"lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi,\" he's \"chuckled\" at the idea.",
      "\"The day he got out, we had Democrats with the most over-the-top superlatives, comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing,\" Khanna said. \"So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory.\"",
      "Khanna said Harris' was a \"winnable campaign,\" adding that \"anyone who is saying now 'this was not a winnable campaign' didn't say that back in August.\"",
      "\"The reason we didn't win, ultimately, is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground\" on emphasizing economic issues, Khanna said. \"The reason I'm hopeful for the future is we have the substance.\"",

      "With a final tally of 312 electoral votes, Republicans scored their biggest White House win in 36 years. Republicans will also control the Senate with at least 52 seats, and there are two races that have not yet been called by CBS News. Control of the House is still to be determined with a few contests outstanding, but CBS News rates it as leaning Republican at this point.",

      "ROBERT COSTA: Great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "In recent days, I have spoken to president-elect Trump, called him up on the phone, along with his top advisers and allies. And what's notable about this transition is that, unlike in 2016, when he was elected as a Washington outsider, now he knows all the players in Washington.",
      "And he alone, more than any other aid, is evaluating the personnel and possibilities around him. And he reflected in one of our conversations about how he sees his mandate, that he has a movement and a base and now a party that's fully behind him. And he wants to make sure that anyone who comes on board has his same vision for that mandate and for his perceived level of support.",
      "And you have seen in recent days people around Trump in the wider orbit are trying to recommend a lot of names, but it's Trump himself who's saying to his top aides like Susie Wiles, his incoming chief of staff, that he wants to make sure that this is not a chaotic process and it's reflective of where he wants to go, more than any other kind of counsel.",
      "And on foreign policy, for example, you see names like Senator Bill Hagerty, Senator Marco Rubio, former Ambassador Ric Grenell, all people who identify with Trump's vision. But those who have had issues with Trump in the past about how he perceives foreign policy, like, for example, former Ambassador Nikki Haley or former Secretary Mike Pompeo, are now out of the process.",
      "And it's not because of any personal trouble with Trump, I'm told. It's because, at the end of the day, Trump wants to make sure things are moving along smoothly on ideological and policy lines come January.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do we know what it was with Mike Pompeo, who served him quite loyally for four years as CIA director and secretary of state? Was it his support, for example, of Ukraine?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: It's just a different orbit around Trump right now. The president-elect has people like Donald Trump Jr., Elon Musk. He has Steve Bannon on the outside advising him.",
      "These are people who are noninterventionists. These are people who aren't traditional Republican hawks. That's not to say some hawks won't end up in this administration or some Wall Street figures might end up in this administration as well.",
      "I'm told by my sources that the president-elect is not ruling out mainstream Republicans or more centrist Republicans from joining his team. But, at this point, he's moving quickly to make sure his base, his party, and his image is reflected in the personnel picks fully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What are his priorities for the 1st 100 days? Or is that too traditional a way of thinking about it?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: No, they have a real agenda this time. You remember, in 2017, it was somewhat sporadic in how they moved and navigated on health care and taxes.",
      "They are moving quickly already behind the scenes to expand the Trump tax cuts, to institute sweeping tariffs across the board. They're also going to try to, on foreign policy, begin negotiations with Ukraine and Russia sometime early next year. And you have mass deportations, more than anything, galvanizing the Trump people behind the scenes.",
      "Of course, they know it's going to be controversial. To remove undocumented migrants in a big way across the country could be logistically difficult and politically challenging, but they're moving ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bob Costa, thank you.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Donald Trump has this sweeping mandate, as do Republicans. Do you see this as an unrestrained presidency?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Oh, I think this is a presidency that has a mandate like we haven't seen, as you mentioned, in 36 years. The American public has spoken loud and clear. And",
      "I think if you go back to your interview with Bob, there are a number of places where Washington has been out of touch with the American people. You mentioned Ukraine. I think that's a great example. The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation.",
      "You think about it, we've sent $175 billion of U.S. aid to Ukraine. That's more than three times the entire annual budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. I have been one of the few senators in the United States Senate who has voted and has opposed every cent of this Ukraine aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I have been listening to the American people. We need to focus on our own issues first.",
      "And I have taken a lot of heat over it from Mitch McConnell, from \"The Wall Street Journal.\"",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: But this is what the American people spoke up and want us to do. We should never have been in Ukraine. It's a result of failed policies, failed energy policies, the failure in Afghanistan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's no U.S. presence in Ukraine. Are you talking about\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: No, but our funds. I'm talking about the vast amount of funds, again, $175 billion.",
      "That's a tremendous amount, as I said, more than three times the budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. The American people want to focus on fixing our problems here. And with the border's collapse, with crime in the cities, we've got to pay attention to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So does that mean just cuts to U.S. military aid to all countries?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: What it means is that we need to take a very deliberate focus on America first.",
      "But we need to be leading from a position of strength, Margaret. As I said, we would not be in this position. Now what we have is an administration that's allowing Russia to sell at a $60-a-barrel cap. The argument they make, that reduces Russia's profits.",
      "What it does, actually, is it subsidizes China to compete again unfairly against us with an energy cost advantage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And we keep Vladimir Putin fully funding this war in Ukraine. We need to stop that. We need to go back to producing our own energy and take Russia out.",
      "Interestingly, interestingly, I will call this the Trump effect. But just in the past 72 hours, what we've seen is the E.U. say, maybe we should replace Russian LNG with U.S. LNG. You've seen in New York City\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that \u2013 that's been talked about for some time.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 we're not going to issue debit cards to illegal immigrants anymore. Migrant caravans are being broken up below the border and turned around.",
      "The U.K. has said, we're going to step our defense budget up to about 2.5 percent, all since President Trump was elected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of that was \u2013 was in process already, but let me ask you specifically on Ukraine.",
      "So Hungary's Prime Minister has said that Donald Trump has told him he will cut off support to Ukraine. You are saying here, I think, in the new Congress, there will be no more aid to Ukraine.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I have certainly not voted for any aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you haven't, but is that \u2013 is that the mandate?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And I think President Trump will find \u2013 President Trump will find a way to deal with this. I'm not going to get ahead of him. I'm certain that he's going to find a way to navigate this that's in the interest of the American people and will stop the carnage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, but\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Look, what's happened in Ukraine is terrible. People are dying.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They continue to die. But we need to stop this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 but here's the thing, we also are seeing this alignment of like an axis of adversaries, right? You have Iranian equipment. You have Chinese equipment.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Deeply concerning, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You have North Korean personnel on the battlefield.",
      "So this idea that Ukraine is somehow divorced from the rest of geopolitics doesn't seem to be bearing out. It's of deep concern to some of our Asian allies, Japan, South Korea. So how are you going to be able to do this without complicating the chessboard?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, I think it's become complicated because America has not been standing in a position of strength. The reason is that Russia has been fully funded because of the policies that allow them to sell energy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are extensive sanctions on Russia, whether or not they're\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Iran, we had them shut down. Iran was broke. Now they're able to fund terror all over the world. We had a maximum pressure campaign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In part because they have all these other adversaries that they're doing business with, right? China.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They were not able to do that under the Trump administration. That's why we saw peace breaking out in the Middle East. Without Iran being shut down, which is what we did under the maximum pressure campaign \u2013 President Trump led this.",

      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Nothing to the level that we've seen here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the assassination of Qasem Soleimani.",
      "But, on the Middle East. Israel's Prime Minister said this morning that he spoke to President Trump three times in recent days, and they discussed Iran and they discussed a peace plan. Do you know what the content of those conversations was?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: No. And, if I did, I wouldn't discuss them here, because that has to be navigated very carefully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the reasons I ask is, we do have this this mid-November deadline that the State Department, the Pentagon have set for Israel to improve the flow of aid to Gaza's two million residents. The U.N. says there is famine already, or on the verge of famine.",
      "If it is found that Israel is indeed violating. U.S. law, would you hold them accountable? Should there be consequences? Because they are recipients of U.S. aid.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, I have had huge disagreements with this administration in terms of how they've administered their entire policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is U.S. law. It's not just this administration. It's humanitarian law.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Yes. Well, I think what we've seen just break out again in the past 70-plus hours since President Trump won the election, Hamas is now looking for total peace. So I think the environment has totally changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They've announced they'd like to see peace. They like to see peace in Gaza. Let's see where that leads.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe \u2013 you believe that there will be a hostage deal negotiated under President Trump?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I would like to see what \u2013 I would like to see what Hamas means by this statement. But it seems that the entire environment is shifting right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Because they see new leadership coming in. And I'm encouraged by that, and I think we'll have new opportunities to \u2013 again, President Trump was able to deliver peace through strength.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think that's on the way, and I'm optimistic what it might lead to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the interesting dynamics we saw in this election was that Mr. Trump was able to, in some ways, successfully campaign and peel off Muslim voters, Arab voters. Certainly, in the state of Michigan, you saw some of that.",
      "Do you think \u2013 and they were frustrated by the carnage in Gaza. As a result, do you think Mr. Trump ends up with more wiggle room here to perhaps hold the Israeli prime minister to account, or does he just give a green light?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think what President Trump is going to do is focus on the root cause, to borrow a term that was used a great deal in the last administration.",
      "He's going to focus on Iran, because the cause of this is the Iranian funding and training\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 of Hamas, of Hezbollah, of the Houthis. That would have never happened\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 except for the fact that they released the enforcement of sanctions\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 upholding international law and U.S. legal standards to recipients of U.S. military aid, do you think he will stick by that?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: President Trump is certainly going to uphold U.S. law, but he is also going to make certain that our allies are properly cared for and that our adversaries are dealt with accordingly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you this, because you know Asia really well, but five of America's seven treaty commitments are in that Asia-Pacific.",
      "The U.S. has exposure there in a tremendous way. The last time Donald Trump was president, he talked about pulling U.S. troops out of Japan, pulling them out of South Korea. Is that a priority now, reducing the military footprint in Asia?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think that comes back again to the failure of the elite here in Washington, Margaret, to understand how a businessperson negotiates.",
      "Everybody has got to sit down and talk about what the options are. We have been supporting military presence in that area ever since World War Two, ever since the Korean War, a significant investment on behalf of the American people.",
      "Those investments were made at a time when these economies were collapsed. They were developing countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Today, they are fully developed countries. It's entirely relevant and I think appropriate for President Trump to discuss, within the level of support\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of signaling strength, saying we might ditch our allies isn't exactly a positive message, right?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think the message should be that our allies can and should step up to the extent possible to strengthen their own capabilities. We're seeing it happen. We're seeing it happen in Japan.",
      "They've agreed to double their defense budget from 1 percent to 2 percent of GDP. That's a positive development.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They're trying to work more closely with us. I think, in President Trump's administration, they definitely will.",
      "This is the direction that we need to go. Same for South Korea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, you are on a number of powerful Senate Committees. Do you think you're more useful to Mr. Trump in the Senate, or would you join his Cabinet, if asked?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I will just say this.",
      "I was privileged to have a tremendous career in business, but one of the greatest honors in my life was to represent the United States, the greatest country in the world, in President Trump's administration overseas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: It's also been one of the greatest honors in my life to represent the people of Tennessee serving in the United States Senate.",
      "In whatever role I hold going \u2013 going forward, it's going to be advanced - - it's going to be advancing the positions that President Trump has articulated that the American people overwhelmingly supported.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And I will do that in whatever role necessary, but we are going to see America strong again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Hagerty, thank you for your time today.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Thank you so much, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.",
      "Jake, good to have you here.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN (U.S. National Security Adviser): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we know President Biden and president-elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday.",
      "There are a lot of fires around the world. What is it that President Biden wants to deliver in terms of a focus and message?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, the first and most important message will be that President Biden is committed to the peaceful transfer of power and to a responsible handoff from one president to the next, which is in the best tradition of our country and has been for the last 240 years.",
      "And then they will go through the top issues, both domestic and foreign policy issues, including what is happening in Europe and Asia and the Middle East. And the president will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things, where they stand and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these \u2013 these issues when he takes office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's go to Ukraine, because we just heard from Senator Hagerty that world view from that portion of the Republican Party right now.",
      "We know the war is expanding there. The North Korean troops seem to have entered the fight. You have all these adversaries all in on Russia winning there. What can you do in the remaining 70 days to sort of change what's happening on the ground or Trump-proof the strategy, so to speak?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, look, our approach remains the same as it's been for the last 2.5 years, which is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position on the battlefield, so that it is ultimately in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.",
      "And it should be up to Ukraine to decide, for its own sovereignty and its own territorial integrity, when and how it goes to the negotiating table. It should be up to the United States and a coalition of nations that we have built to continue to supply Ukraine with the means to defend itself against brutal Russian aggression.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got, like, what, $6 billion in money left that's already\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And President Biden made clear when President Zelenskyy was here in Washington a couple of months ago that we would spend all of the resources that were provided to us by the Congress on time and in full, meaning that, by January 20, we will have sent the full amount of resources and aid to Ukraine the Congress has authorized.",
      "And, of course, President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe.",
      "And, ultimately, as the Japanese Prime Minister said, if we walk away from Ukraine in Europe, the question about America's commitment to our allies in Asia will grow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you mean President Biden is going to ask Congress to pass more money for Ukraine before he leaves office?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal.",
      "But President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term, because the threat to Ukraine will remain no matter what exactly happens on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, and the United States should not walk away from its commitment, either to Ukraine or to 50 nations that we have rallied in defense of Ukraine in both Europe and Asia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, U.S. intelligence assessed that Russia favored Donald Trump in this election, that Russia interfered in a fairly dramatic and visible fashion with these fake videos.",
      "What consequence are they going to pay, if any, for doing that?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first, let's not forget that we are currently helping Ukraine fight Russia in Ukraine\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: \u2026 in the most dramatic and full-throated way one could \u2013 could imagine. So we are already doing a substantial number of things to impose costs on Russia.",
      "We have also passed the most sweeping sanctions on Russia that we have seen against a major economy in the world\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Senator Hagerty was saying it's \u2013 Russia's doing fine even with those sanctions.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first of all, you can see in many different ways, whether it's inflation in Russia, whether it's their ability over time to actually grow their economy, their technology, their capacity to invest in new sources of energy going down the line, that the picture for Russia looks increasingly bleak as time goes on, and that the sanctions are biting.",
      "They have not stopped, obviously, Russia from being able to carry out its military operations in Ukraine today, but they have painted a darker picture for Ukraine \u2013 for Russia tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what Russia is giving North Korea's Kim Jong-un in exchange for the men he is sending to fight on the battlefield in Ukraine?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: We don't know for sure.",
      "And, frankly, I think Vladimir Putin doesn't know for sure. I think he probably hasn't decided exactly what he's going to do for North Korea on a going-forward basis.",
      "But I will tell you this. Kim Jong-un expects that he's going to get something significant, probably in the form of military and technology support from Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For its nuclear program?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And that's a distinct possibility. I can't say exactly what will happen, but we have already heard the Russians come out and say that North Korea's nuclear program should be looked at differently today than it was five or 10 years ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: So the concern about the relationship between Russia and North Korea in both directions is very real and something that all of the nations of the free world need to pay attention to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Prime Minister Netanyahu said he spoke to Donald Trump three times in the past few days. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, is coming to the White House. That was just announced.",
      "What makes you think in these final days of the Biden administration that Benjamin Netanyahu would agree to peace in Gaza or agree to peace in Lebanon and not hold on to that political capital for the new president?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Prime Minister Netanyahu will make his decisions, and \u2013 and he'll speak to his decisions.",
      "Here's what I see. First, in Gaza, it really today is not Israel that is standing in the way of a cease-fire and hostage deal. It is Hamas. Israel has said it's prepared to do a temporary cease-fire for a number of hostages and then try to build on that to get all of the hostages home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Hamas has said no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 Mr. \u2013 Senator Hagerty was talking about on that with Hamas?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: I don't know about the particular statement he made.",
      "What I will tell you is, whatever Hamas is saying publicly, what they are communicating to the mediators is, no, we will not do a cease-fire-and- hostage deal at this time.",
      "So what we need to do is get the rest of the world to continue to increase pressure on Hamas to come to the table to do a deal in Gaza, because the Israeli government has said it's prepared to take a temporary step in that direction.",
      "And then, when it comes to Lebanon, we have been actively engaged in discussions with the Israeli government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Those should remain behind closed doors.",
      "But we do believe that, at some point, the Israeli government wants to do a deal that gets its citizens back home. I don't think it's doing that deal for American politics. I think it's doing that deal to try to secure Israel. And I expect that, in the coming weeks, we will see progress in that direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you hold Israel to account?",
      "Because the secretaries of state and defense have sent letters saying that they're not allowing in aid to the degree they should, and that there are possibly forced displacements from Northern Gaza. On this program, you have said that was essentially a red line.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: So, basically, what you have seen from Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken is a letter to their Israeli counterparts that says\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: \u2026 here is a set of steps we expect you to take, and we are going to measure you against the progress you are making towards those steps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: This week, we will make our judgments about what kind of progress they have made. And then Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, the president will make judgments about what we do in response, and I'm not going to get ahead of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, President Xi and President Biden will be in the same place at these summits in the next few days. Will the president confront him about this pervasive and massive hacking of telecom companies known as Salt Typhoon?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: President Biden, every time he sees his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, speaks to him about cyber- enabled espionage, about cyberattacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a significant attack.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Yes, it is. It is an absolutely significant attack. It's something that the FBI, our Department of Homeland Security, and our entire national security enterprise is digging into in a big way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And, of course, it will be on the agenda between every American official and every Chinese official in the weeks ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake Sullivan, a lot happening in the world. Thank you for coming in and talking to us.",
      "We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Stay tuned across CBS News for all the latest news on president-elect Donald Trump's transition plans and how his new policies will impact Americans. You can watch live or on demand on Paramount+ or on our CBS News app.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with California Congressman Ro Khanna.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna. He's in California this morning.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "This was a rough week for Democrats. I don't have to tell you that. But, Congressman, I mean, just to level with the American people, Democrats and the Harris campaign told them that the fate of democracy itself was at stake. Was that a cynical, political tactic, or, if it's reality, what is the plan now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): Well, Margaret, I think what was at stake is the degradation of American democracy. The course of this, a political discourse. The idea that you have people who are undocumented, 12 million, who may be subject to a violation of their rights. The issues is about climate and the reversal on that. I've never said that you weren't going to have future elections. And I was never one of these people who said you're not going to have 2026 or 2028. In one or two years, Donald Trump is going to be a lame duck.",
      "But I do think that we need to make sure we stand up for people's rights in this country and are looking forward and what we can do to win back the House and the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at CBS polling, when you compare Harris in 2024 to Biden in 2020, you see clearly that the Democratic coalition lost support among Latino voters, young voters, women. Republicans really made gains here with men of color as well. Why do you think there is this fracturing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We did not have a compelling enough economic vision. The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans, not just working class Americans, a large slice of Americans who feel the American dream has slipped away for their families and their kids. And you have new voices, Congress people like Pat Ryan, Mary - Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Chris Deluzio, who are saying, look, we need to have a vision on building new factories, on helping raise minimum wage, on dealing with child care, and emphasize that our party has a better economic story. I think that can unify our party, moderates and progressives, and it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, black voters, white working class voters. And we had a better vision than Donald Trump on that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's interesting, in this Monday morning quarterbacking that's happening, to hear from so many Democrats now who are saying that they think that economic message should have been front and center, but that they felt constrained somehow by this focus on identity politics. Tom Suozzi of New York brought that up, talking about Republicans being able to weaponize anarchy on college campuses, defunding the police, and gender questions and girls sports. Do you think this, you know, movement, woke politics, really was incredibly damaging to the left? Because a large part of that came from the progressive wing in - on which you are a member.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, I have always said that we need to be emphasizing the economic issues. But I don't think we should run away for standing up for trans rights, for standing up for equal rights for people, for teaching American history responsibly. You can be true to your values with two things, Margaret. One, if someone disagrees with you, we need to respect that disagreement, not cancel or shame them. Don't shy away from your convictions, but have a reasonable conversation. I did that with Megyn Kelly on a podcast on trans rights. I stuck to my position, but we had a reasonable conversation.",
      "The second thing is, if we emphasize the economic hardships people are facing. I've got $12 trillion in my district in Silicon Valley while towns like Johnstown (ph) were hollowed out. Galesburg, Illinois, were hollowed out. We can build new factories. We can build new industry. We can create new economic opportunity. We have a vision of how to do that. Joe Biden - President Biden started it. I think we can win over people, even if they may not agree with us, on a particular social issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you specifically about your district, since you just mentioned it. Silicon Valley was thought of as reliably blue, but particularly in this election you saw money going towards Donald Trump. You've seen some very prominent tech names, Elon Musk significantly. And J.D. Vance, the vice presidential candidate, he really reached out into that tech community as part of that campaign.",
      "What is the thing that Silicon Valley thinks it's going to get from a Trump administration? Is it - is it no taxes on capital gains? Is it not regulating crypto? What is it that the people in your district think they're getting from Donald Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, first of all, Margaret, 70 percent of Silicon Valley still supported Vice President Harris and Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: But you're right that we had slippage, and probably now 20 percent, 30 percent support Donald Trump. They have different reasons for doing it. Some of them want more free speech. Some of them want deregulation. Some of them want tax cuts. Some of them want AI not to be regulated. Some of them were concerned on crypto.",
      "But I think what the Democrats need to remind folks of, and I reminded Elon of this, is that Tesla got funding from President Obama. SpaceX got started because Ash Carter, under President Obama, helped Elon get that facility. The Democrats are the party that has invested in the science and technology to help build Silicon Valley. And we can be the party that helps AI and robotics build new factories, build new industry in different parts of the country.",
      "When we argue policy, we have a better vision for how to get Americans and prosperity in a modern economy. And if we focus on that, I believe we will win back the majority and win back in 2028.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker Pelosi told \"The New York Times\" there were messaging errors, yes, but she also said, there should have been an open primary system here, and that President Biden's decision to endorse Vice President Harris immediately made it impossible.",
      "Do you agree with her?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, look, I have a lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi, but I've sort of chuckled with people have said this about President Biden because the day he got out we had Democrats with the most over the top superlatives, comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing. So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory.",
      "I think this was a winnable campaign, even when he got out. Vice President Harris was five points up in some of the polls. Anyone who is saying now this was not a winnable campaign didn't say that back in August. The reason we didn't win ultimately is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground. People like Chris Deluzio, Pat Wright (ph), who were saying, talk about the economy. Talk about people's economic struggles. Have - convince people you have the better policies and better vision.",
      "The reason I'm hopeful for the future is, we have the substance. We actually - you can't build new factories just with tariffs and tax cuts. You need federal financing. We have actual investment in apprenticeships. And I think over the long run, the American people will see the truth of the policy ideas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were a surrogate for Joe Biden. You were then a surrogate for Kamala Harris. And on this program you defended both many times. One place you did create space was on the issue of Gaza. You said when you were going to college campuses, when you were talking to progressives, when you were talking to voters of color, not just Arabs and Muslims, you heard there was a problem here.",
      "Do you think that the numbers you saw, particularly in Michigan, vindicated your point of view, or was there just a greater force at work?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I think she would have certainly won Michigan if there was more of a reckoning with the failures of policy on Gaza. And that wasn't my point of view. That was the point of view of a lot of people I was hearing on the ground.",
      "I also think, beyond Michigan, this really was a concern for a lot of young people and a lot of progressives.",
      "Now, my hope is, because President Trump got some of the votes from the Muslim and Arab community, I was just on a bipartisan CODEL in Saudi Arabia, they have said that if the president wants a deal with Saudi Arabia that the Palestinian state and a two-state solution has to be front and center, and I hope we can work towards actually doing that after the war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ro Khanna. Congressman, thank you very much for your time today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the economy and Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari. He joins us now.",
      "Neel, good morning to you.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI (Minneapolis Federal Reserve President): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, right after the election, another big event was the Federal Reserve moving on interest rates, cutting them for the second time so far this year. That seemed to indicate that you believe inflation is being defeated here.",
      "Can you tell us your assessment of how stable the economy is and how confident you are that we are on a glide path that will avoid recession?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we've made a lot of progress in bringing inflation down, and the economy has remained remarkably strong. We keep getting revisions to GDP that are - show that the economy is growing even faster than we had appreciated, and the unemployment rate is 4.1 percent. So, right now, the economy is in a good place. Inflation is still running around 2.5 percent or so. So, we're not all the way home. We need to finish the job. But so far so good. I mean I don't want to declare victory yet. We need to finish the job. But we're on a good path right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Finish the job. Are - you're - it sounds like you're expecting another rate cut?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we want to have confidence that inflation is going to go all the way back down to our 2 percent target. So, if you look at the - what we call the summary of economic projections, which are the forecast that my colleagues and I put out, the expectation is that we would do another interest rate cut in December. We need to actually see what the data looks like before reaching any conclusions. And that's six weeks from now. But I think another rate cut is certainly possible.",
      "But ultimately, if the economy continues to perform well, a strong economy, a strong labor market, that's going to - that's the outcome that we're all trying to achieve. And I don't think that that's a partisan view. I think everybody's on board with trying to achieve that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fed is apolitical. But we are looking at promises of major changes in this new administration. One of them is mass deportations.",
      "When you were last here in June, we talked about the impact of immigration on inflation. You said, in some ways it helps lower it by filling jobs. At the same time you said it may contribute to it because it creates more demand for goods.",
      "How long before we would see the economic impact of say a mass deportation plan?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's a great question, Margaret. I mean I think - if you just assume that people are working, either working in farms or working in factories, and then those businesses now lose employees, that would probably cause some disruption for those businesses as they try to respond to that. And so the implications for inflation are not entirely clear to me. I think ultimately it's going to be between the business community and Congress and the executive branch to figure out what \u2013 you know, how they would adjust to that and how - how long it would take and how disruptive it would be.",
      "I don't have any insight into that. I'm not sure what the inflation implications would be. I think it's a big question of how long it would take, how many new immigrants were coming in. There's just so much uncertainly about what the actual policies will be, what will get passed through the Congress, how it will be implemented. We, at the Fed, will simply wait. We have to wait and see what the rest of the government decides to do before we analyze what it means for the economy going forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know you don't control fiscal policy, but the president-elect has unveiled a plan that estimates say would add $8 trillion to the deficit. How concerned are you about rising deficits?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, if you look over the long-term, if you look at, for example, at the Congressional Budget Office forecast of debts and deficits, they grow to the moon. They grow unsustainably. So, at some point, those have to be addressed. And that is purely the domain of the Congress and the executive branch to negotiate how to do that. At some point they have to be addressed. And so our focus is, whatever Congress and the administration decide to do, we have our goals. Our goals are 2 percent inflation and a strong labor market, maximum employment, and we will adjust our monetary policies to try to achieve that.",
      "But, you're right, over the long run, it's clear that the deficit needs to be addressed. But that is also, as I said, the domain of Congress and the executive branch to sort out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Goldman Sachs analysts were out this week with a report saying that the last time we saw Trump tariffs, it - the cost was passed along to consumers. They estimate every 5 percent increase in the tariff rate would reduce corporate earnings per share by 1 to 2 percent because it would pull back consumer spending, possibly trigger retaliatory tariffs and increased uncertainty. How much of a downside risk is there if we get into this business of tariffs?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, from an inflation perspective, it's pretty easy to model a one-time tariff. So, if somebody imposed a 1 percent tariff or a 10 percent tariff, you would think that that would increase prices of those goods either 1 percent or 10 percent. That's pretty easy to model and it shouldn't have an effect long-run on inflation.",
      "The challenge becomes if there's a tit for tat and it's one country imposing tariffs and then responses and it's escalating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: That's where it becomes more concerning, and, frankly, a lot more uncertain.",
      "So I think, again, with - as is with fiscal policy, we'll have to wait and see what actually gets implemented and then how other countries might respond to that. It's just - right now we're just all guessing what will actually happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's safe to say that the new president will take office with what appears to be the economy trending upwards?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: The economy is strong. You know, when I reach out to business and labor unions all around my region it's one of cautious optimism, that the economy is doing well, there are jobs available. And we want to keep the economy doing well. We want to keep that growth going while we get inflation all the way back down to 2 percent. And so, right now, I would say, we have a strong economy, and that's a really good thing. And our objective is to keep it there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chair Powell was asked this week at a press conference if he would resign if asked. He made clear he does not think that the law would require that. And, in fact, it would violate the law.",
      "But there is a broader conversation right now about political influence on the Fed. Are you concerned about it?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: I'm not. My colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are totally committed to the dual mandate goals of 2 percent inflation and maximum employment that Congress has assigned us. That's what's driving the decisions that we've been making. And that will continue to do so.",
      "And there are also structural elements that are designed by Congress to provide continuity. So, the governors at the board of governors in Washington serve up to 14-year terms. The presidents of the reserve banks are independent. These are structures that Congress put in place to provide continuity. Between that and, I think, bipartisan support, that we all want to get inflation back down to 2 percent and we want to keep the economy strong, I'm confident that we will continue to focus on our economic jobs, and that's what should be dictating what we're doing, and that is what's dictating what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Neel Kashkari, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by Dame Karen Pierce, the U.K.'s ambassador to the United States.",
      "Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE (British Ambassador to the United States): Thank you very much, Margaret. Nice to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Ambassador, after this election there was a lot of chatter in Europe about Europe needing to act alone, or at least without as much of an American support mechanism there. The French president said, \"Europe needs to take back control.\" Italy's prime minister said, \"don't ask what the U.S. can do for you, ask what Europe should do for itself.\"",
      "What do you think Trump's return will mean for Europe?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I think in all my experience, Margaret, when America and Europe work together, that's when you get success. That's when you get coherence in policy. We saw that in the Balkans. We've seen it at every conflict since the 1990s. It's great that Europe wants to do more. We want to be a part of that. We've got a lot of burden sharing going on in Europe on Ukraine. I think perhaps it's not well understood in America, if I may say so, quite how much Europe is doing for Ukraine, and we want to talk about that with the incoming administration, as well as work with the Biden team to help Ukraine even further.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom, of course, has provided a tremendous amount of weaponry and support to Ukraine.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: That's exactly right. I think we're over $16 billion all in. We provided the first tanks. We provided the first anti-tank weapons. We have trained Ukrainian pilots. We're going to go on supporting Ukraine for as long as they need us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you do that if the United States cuts off financial and military aid to Ukraine?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, we obviously hope that doesn't happen and we're going to be wanting to have lots of conversations with the outgoing and incoming administrations on just how best to support Ukraine. I think we all want the same thing. We want a stable, secure, peaceful Euro-Atlantic area. And if Putin is allowed to succeed in Ukraine, that threatens all of us, including the U.S., and it certainly emboldens China. And I don't think anyone in the U.S. wants to see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on Friday, Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, who is a problematic NATO ally, he's friends with Vladamir Putin and Donald Trump, he said, \"the situation on the front is obvious. There's been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war.\" He's talking about Ukraine.",
      "Do you think Mr. Trump is persuadable on this issue?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, I don't think it's for any single European leader to say what President Trump might do. I think we need to hear from President Trump after inauguration on what the new administration plans are. But certainly, I know they share our goal of wanting to have security and stability, and we'll be talking to them and the outgoing Biden administration to see how best we can support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Orban does speak with Donald Trump, but you don't get the sense that he is reflecting what's next?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We speak to Donald Trump. The prime minister spoke to him very recently on the Wednesday after, the day after the election.",
      "In my experience, President Trump is his own person. He'll listen to a lot of advice, some of it solicited, some of it unsolicited, and he'll weigh the pros and cons and he'll come to his own decision. But I have always found him and his team very willing to listen to our point of view.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on the trade front, there's also concern in Europe, as I understand it, about what may be coming with tariffs. The Trump campaign has proposed a 10 percent across the board tariff on Europe. Goldman Sachs projects it will be perhaps a little bit more limited and focused on auto exports. Do you have a sense that the U.K. may be able to avoid this kind of financial penalty, essentially?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We would very much hope so, as the U.K. You know, we've got free trade in our DNA, as it were. We don't believe in tariffs as an instrument of trade. We have a slightly different approach for many American trade specialists on that. And I think the last thing the world needs at the moment is a tariff war. That doesn't help anybody. Trade and investments is a hugely important part of what we do with America. Something like a trillion dollars goes backwards and forwards across the Atlantic in trade and investment each year. Let's not put that at risk. Let's try and find out how we can work together to increase investment in trade. And there's also the really important issue of economic security that's now come onto the agenda. And we'll be wanting to talk to the incoming administration about that also.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you served here in Washington during the first Trump administration. You know many of these players. The current U.K. government is a different one, of course, from that period of time, with the Labour Party in charge. I have to ask you about that direct relationship, because the top diplomat, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, years ago, and you know this quote, wrote, \"Trump is not only a woman-hating, neo-Nazi sympathizing sociopath, he's a profound threat to the international order.\"",
      "Are you concerned that those past statements, and the ideological differences, will be a problem in what has been a special relationship?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I don't think the past statements will be a problem, to be absolutely honest, Margaret. Politicians say a lot of things on both sides. And even in America, some people who are now in the Trump administration, or will be in the Trump administration, like the vice president-elect, have also said critical things about President Trump.",
      "In my experience, politicians kind of absorb those sorts of comments as part of the wear and tear of political life. What's important is the relationship now. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, had a very warm dinner with President Trump in September. He very graciously invited them to his private home in Trump Tower. We discussed a huge range of issues.",
      "You're right that they come from different political philosophies. I won't call them ideological. I don't think Keir Starmer is ideological. And I don't think President Trump is. It's about finding out how we can work together. What they do have in common is this desire to get the economies moving, to get growth for the ordinary citizen, to make sure things are better for the ordinary citizen. And we had a very good conversation about that with President Trump in September.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it. Thank you for watching. Happy birthday, Marines!",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Rep. Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 10, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna. He's in California this morning. Good morning to you. This was a rough week for Democrats. I don't have to tell you that, but Congressman, I mean, just to level with the American people, Democrats and the Harris campaign told them that the fate of democracy itself was at stake. Was that a cynical political tactic, or, if it's reality, what is the plan now?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, Margaret, I think what was at stake is the degradation of American democracy, the coarseness of political discourse, the idea that you have people who are undocumented, 12 million, who may be subject to a violation of their rights. The issues about climate and the reversal on that. I've never said that you weren't going to have future elections, and I was never one of these people who said you're not going to have 2026 or 2028 in one or two years, Donald Trump is going to be a lame duck. But I do think that we need to make sure we stand up for people's rights in this country and are looking forward and what we can do to win back the House and the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at CBS polling, when you compare Harris in 2024 to Biden in 2020 you see clearly that the Democratic coalition lost support among Latino voters, young voters, women. Republicans really made gains here with men of color as well. Why do you think there is this fracturing?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: We did not have a compelling enough economic vision. The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans, not just working class Americans, a large slice of Americans who feel the American Dream has slipped away for their families and their kids, and you have new voices Congress, people like Pat Ryan, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Chris Deluzio, who are saying, look, we need to have a vision on building new factories, on helping raise minimum wage, on dealing with child care, and emphasize that our party has a better economic story. I think that could unify our party, moderates and progressives. And it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, Black voters, white working class voters, and we have a better vision than Donald Trump on that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's interesting in this Monday morning quarterbacking that's happening to hear from so many Democrats now, who are saying that they think that economic message should have been front and center, but that they felt constrained somehow by this focus on identity politics. Tom Suozzi of New York brought that up talking about Republicans being able to weaponize anarchy on college campuses, defunding the police and gender questions and girls sports. Do you think this, you know, movement \"woke\" politics really was incredibly damaging to the left, because a large part of that came from the progressive wing in, of which you are a member.",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, I have always said that we need to be emphasizing the economic issues, but I don't think we should run away for standing up for trans rights, for standing up for equal rights for people, for teaching American history responsibly. You can be true to your values with two things, Margaret. One, if someone disagrees with you, we need to respect that disagreement, not cancel or shame them. Don't shy away from your convictions, but have a reasonable conversation. I did that with Megyn Kelly on a podcast on trans rights. I stuck to my position, but we had a reasonable conversation. The second thing is, if we emphasize the economic hardships people are facing, I've got $12 trillion in my district in Silicon Valley, while towns like Johnstown were hollowed out. Galesburg, Illinois were hollowed out. We can build new factories. We can build new industry. We can create new economic opportunity. We have a vision of how to do that. Biden -President Biden started it. I think we can win over people, even if they may not agree with us on a particular social issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you specifically about your district. Since you just mentioned it, Silicon Valley was thought of as reliably blue, but particularly in this election, you saw money going towards Donald Trump. You've seen some very prominent tech names, Elon Musk, significantly. And JD Vance, the vice-presidential candidate. He really reached out into that tech community as part of that campaign. What is the thing that Silicon Valley thinks it's going to get from a Trump administration? Is it, is it no taxes on capital gains? Is it not regulating crypto? What is it that the people in your district think they're getting from Donald Trump?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, first of all, Margaret, 70% of Silicon Valley still supported Vice President Harris and Democrats --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Yes",
      "REP. KHANNA: But you're right that we had a slippage and probably now 20-30% support Donald Trump. They have different reasons for doing it. Some of them want more free speech. Some of them want deregulation. Some of them want tax cuts. Some of them want AI not to be regulated. Some of them were concerned on crypto. But I think what the Democrats need to remind folks of, and I've reminded Elon of this, is that Tesla got funding from President Obama. SpaceX got started because Ash Carter, under President Obama, helped Elon get that facility. The Democrats are the party that has invested in the science and technology to help build Silicon Valley, and we can be the party that helps AI robotics, build new factories, build new industry in different parts of the country. When we argue policy, we have a better vision for how to get Americans prosperity in a modern economy. And if we focus on that, I believe we will win back the majority and win back in 2028.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker Pelosi told The New York Times there were messaging errors, yes, but she also said there should have been an open primary system here, and that President Biden's decision to endorse Vice President Harris immediately made it impossible. Do you agree with her?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, look, I have a lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi, but I've sort of chuckled when people have said this about President Biden, because the day he got out, we had Democrats with the most over the top superlatives comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing. So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory. I think this was a winnable campaign. Even when he got out, Vice President Harris was five points up in some of the polls. Anyone who is saying now, this was not a winnable campaign, didn't say that back in August. The reason we didn't win, ultimately, is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground, people like Chris Deluzio, Pat Ryan, who were saying, talk about the economy, talk about people's economic struggles. Have- convince people you have the better policies and better vision. The reason I'm hopeful for the future is we have the substance. We actually- you can't build new factories just with tariffs and tax cuts. You need federal financing. We have actual investment in apprenticeships. And I think over the long run, the American people will see the truth of the policy ideas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were a surrogate for Joe Biden. You were then a surrogate for Kamala Harris, and on this program, you defended both. Many times, one place you did create space was on the issue of Gaza. You said, when you were going to college campuses, when you were talking to progressives, when you were talking to voters of color, not just Arabs and Muslims. You heard there was a problem here. Do you think that the numbers you saw, particularly in Michigan, vindicated your point of view, or was there just a greater force at work?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: I think she would have certainly won Michigan if there was more of a reckoning with the failures of policy on Gaza. That wasn't my point of view. That was the point of view of a lot of people I was hearing on the ground. I also think beyond Michigan, this really was a concern for a lot of young people and a lot of progressives. Now my hope is because President Trump got some of the votes for the Muslim and Arab community. I was just on a bipartisan CODEL in Saudi Arabia. They have said that if the President wants a deal with Saudi Arabia, that the Palestinian state and a two state solution has to be front and center. And I hope we can work towards actually doing that after the war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ro Khanna, Congressman, thank you very much for your time today. We'll be right back."

      "SEN. BILL HAGERTY: \u2013Yes Margaret",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: During the first Trump administration. It's good to have you here.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: It's good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Donald Trump has this sweeping mandate, as do Republicans. Do you see this as an unrestrained presidency?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think this is a presidency that has a mandate like we haven't seen, as you mentioned, in 36 years. The American public has spoken loud and clear. And I think if you go back to your interview with Bob, there are a number of places where Washington has been out of touch with the American people. You mentioned Ukraine, I think that's a great example. The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation. You think about it, we've sent $175 billion of U.S. aid to Ukraine. That's more than three times the entire annual budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. I've been one of the few senators in the United States Senate who has voted and has opposed every cent of this Ukraine aid. I've been listening to the American people. We need to focus on our own issues first. And I've taken a lot of heat over it, from Mitch McConnell from the Wall Street Journal, but this is what the American people spoke up and want us to do. We should never have been in Ukraine. It's a result of failed policies, failed energy policies, the failure in Afghanistan\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013there's no U.S. presence in Ukraine",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: No but our funds. I'm talking about the vast amount of funds, again, $175 billion. That's a tremendous amount, as I said, more than three times the budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. The American people want to focus on fixing our problems here, and with the borders collapse, with crime in the cities, we've got to pay attention to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So does that mean just cuts to U.S. military aid to all countries?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: What it means is that we need to take a very deliberate focus on America first. But we need to be leading from a position of strength, Margaret. As I said, we would not be in this position. Now what we have is an administration that's allowing Russia to sell at a $60 a barrel cap. The argument they make that reduces Russia's profits. What it does actually, is it subsidizes China to compete again, unfairly against us, with an energy cost advantage. And we keep Vladimir Putin fully funding this war in Ukraine. We need to stop that. We need to go back to producing our own energy and take Russia out. Interestingly, interestingly, I'll call this the Trump effect. But just in the past 72 hours, what we've seen is the EU say, \"Maybe we should replace Russian LNG with U.S. LNG. You've seen in New York City\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well that's been talked about for some time--",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: We're not going to issue debit cards to illegal immigrants anymore. Migrant caravans are being broken up below the border and turned around. The UK has said we're going to step our defense budget up to about 2.5% all since President Trump was elected",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of that was- was in process already, but let me ask you specifically on Ukraine. So Hungary's Prime Minister has said that Donald Trump has told him he will cut off support to Ukraine. You are saying here, I think, in the new Congress, there will be no more aid to Ukraine.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I've certainly not voted for any aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you haven't, but is that the mandate?",
      "SEN. HAGARTY:\u00a0 And I think President Trump will find- President Trump will find a way to deal with this. I'm not going to get ahead of him. I'm certain that he's going to find a way to navigate this that's in the interest of the American people and will stop the carnage. Look what's happened in Ukraine is terrible. People are dying. They continue to die. But we need to stop this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But here's the thing, we also are seeing this alignment of like an axis of adversaries, right? You have Iranian equipment, you have Chinese equipment\u2013",
      "SEN. HAGARTY: -- Deeply concerning, yes--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You have North Korean personnel on the battlefield. So this idea that Ukraine is somehow divorced from the rest of geopolitics doesn't seem to be bearing out. It's of deep concern to some of our Asian allies, Japan, South Korea. So how are you going to be able to do this without complicating the chess board?",
      "SEN. HAGARTY: Well, I think it's become complicated because America has not been standing in a position of strength. The reason is that Russia has been fully funded because of the policies that allow them to sell energy\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 on Russia whether or not they're--",
      "SEN. HAGARTY: Iran we had them shut down. Iran was broke, whether or not they're now they're able to fund terror all over the world, we had a maximum pressure \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 In part because they have all these other adversaries that they're doing business with, right? China \u2013",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: They were not able to do that under the Trump administration. That's why we saw peace breaking out in the Middle East. Without Iran being shut down, which is what we did under the maximum pressure campaign. President Trump led this. We're able to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Everybody said it couldn't happen. It did the Abraham Accords. Peace was breaking out in the Middle East because Iran could not fund terror. As soon as the Biden administration came in, they stopped enforcing--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- There were attacks by Iran during the Trump administration--",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: -- Nothing to the level that we've seen here--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, but on the Middle East.\u00a0 Israel's Prime Minister said this morning that he spoke to President Trump three times in recent days, and they discussed Iran and they discussed a peace plan. Do you know what the content of those conversations was?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: No, and if I did, I wouldn't discuss them here, because that has to be navigated very carefully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the reasons I ask is we do have this this mid-November deadline that the State Department- the Pentagon have set for Israel to improve the flow of aid to Gaza's two million residents. The UN says there is famine already, or on the verge of famine. If it is found that Israel is indeed violating. U.S. law, would you hold them accountable? Should there be consequences? Because they are recipients of U.S. aid.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: Well I've had huge disagreements with this administration in terms of how they've administered their entire policy \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is U.S. law, it's not just this administration. It's humanitarian law.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think what we've seen just break out again in the past 70 plus hours since President Trump won the election, Hamas is now looking for total peace. So I think the environment has totally changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: They've announced they'd like to see peace. They like to see peace in Gaza. Let's see where that\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe- you believe that there will be a hostage deal negotiated under President Trump?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I'd like to see what, I'd like to see what Hamas means by this statement. But it seems that the entire environment is shifting right now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah--",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: -- Because they see new leadership coming in. And I'm encouraged by that, and I think we'll have new opportunities to, again, President Trump was able to deliver peace through strength. I think that's on the way, and I'm optimistic what it might lead to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the interesting dynamics we saw in this election was that Mr. Trump was able to, in some ways, successfully campaign and peel off Muslim voters, Arab voters, certainly in the state of Michigan, you saw some of that. Do you think- and they were frustrated by the carnage in Gaza. As a result, do you think Mr. Trump ends up with more wiggle room here to perhaps hold the Israeli prime minister to account, or does he just give a green light?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think what President Trump is going to do is focus on the root cause. To borrow a term that was used a great deal in the last administration. He's going to focus on Iran because the cause of this is the Iranian funding and training of Hamas, of Hezbollah, of the Houthis. That would have never happened--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014 but in terms of \u2014",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: \u2014 Except for the fact that they released- the enforcement of sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014 Upholding international law and U.S. legal standards to recipients of US military aid, do you think he will stick by that?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: President Trump is certainly going to uphold U.S. law, but he is also going to make certain that our allies are properly cared for and that our adversaries are dealt with accordingly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you this, because you know Asia really well, but five of America's seven treaty commitments are in that Asia-Pacific. The U.S. has exposure there in a tremendous way. The last time Donald Trump was president, he talked about pulling US troops out of Japan, pulling them out of South Korea. Is that a priority now, reducing the military footprint in Asia?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think that comes back again to the failure of the elite here in Washington, Margaret, to understand how a business person negotiates. Everybody has got to sit down and talk about what the options are. We have been supporting military presence in that area ever since World War Two, ever since the Korean War. A significant investment on behalf of the American people. Those investments were made at a time when these economies were collapsed. They were developing countries today. They are fully developed countries. It's entirely relevant, and I think appropriate for President Trump to discuss within the level of support--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014 But in terms of signaling strength, saying we might ditch our allies isn't exactly a positive message, right?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think the message should be that our allies can and should step up to the extent possible. To strengthen their own capabilities. We're seeing it happen. We're seeing it happen in Japan, they've agreed to double their defense budget from 1% to 2% of GDP. That's a positive development. They're trying to work more closely with us. I think in President Trump's administration, they definitely will. This is the direction that we need to go. Same for South Korea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go. You are on a number of powerful Senate Committees. Do you think you're more useful to Mr. Trump in the Senate, or would you join his cabinet if asked?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I'll just say this, I was privileged to have a tremendous career in business, but one of the greatest honors in my life was to represent the United States, the greatest country in the world, in President Trump's administration overseas. It's also been one of the greatest honors in my life to represent the people of Tennessee, serving the United States Senate. In whatever role I hold going- going forward, it's going to be advanced. It's going to be advancing the positions that President Trump has articulated, that the American people overwhelmingly supported, and I'll do that in whatever role necessary, but we are going to see America strong again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Hagerty, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: Thank you so much, Margaret."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Neel Kashkari, Minneapolis Federal Reserve president, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 10, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the economy and Minneapolis Federal Reserve President, Neel Kashkari, he joins us now. Neel, good morning to you.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Good morning. Margaret,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So right after the election, another big event was the Federal Reserve moving on interest rates, cutting them for the second time so far this year. That seems to indicate that you believe inflation is being defeated here. Can you tell us your assessment of how stable the economy is and how confident you are that we are on a glide path that will avoid recession?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we've made a lot of progress in bringing inflation down, and the economy has remained remarkably strong. We keep getting revisions to GDP that are- show that the economy is growing even faster than we had appreciated, and the unemployment rate is 4.1% so right now, the economy is in a good place. Inflation is still running around 2.5% or so, so we're not all the way home. We need to finish the job, but so far so good. I mean, I don't want to declare victory yet. We need to finish the job, but we're on a good path right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Finish the job. It sounds like you're expecting another rate cut.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we want to have confidence that inflation is going to go all the way back down to our 2% target. So if you look at the what we call the summary of economic projections, which are the forecast that my colleagues and I put out. The expectation is that we would do another interest rate cut in December. We need to actually see what the data looks like before reaching any conclusions, and that's six weeks from now. But I think another rate cut is certainly possible. But ultimately, if the economy continues to perform well, a strong economy, a strong labor market that's going to that's the outcome that we're all trying to achieve. And I don't think that that's a partisan view. I think everybody's on board with trying to achieve that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fed is apolitical but we are looking at promises of major changes in this new administration. One of them is mass deportations. When you were last here in June, we talked about the impact of immigration on inflation, you said, in some ways, it helps lower it by filling jobs. At the same time, you said it may contribute to it because it creates more demand for goods. How long before we would see the economic impact of, say, a mass deportation plan?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's a great question. Margaret, I mean, I think if you just assume that people are working, either working in farms or working in factories, and then those businesses now lose employees, that would probably cause some disruption for those businesses as they try to respond to that. And so the implications for inflation are not entirely clear to me. I think ultimately it's going to be between the business community and Congress and the executive branch to figure out what you know, how they would adjust to that, and how, how long it would take, and how disruptive it would be. I don't have any insight into that. I'm not sure what the inflation implications would be. I think it's a big question of how long it would take, how many new immigrants were coming in. There's just so much uncertainty about what the actual policies will be, what will get passed through the Congress, how it will be implemented. We at the Fed will simply wait. We have to wait and see what the rest of the government decides to do before we analyze what it means for the economy going forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know you don't control fiscal policy, but the President Elect has unveiled a plan that estimates say would add 8 trillion to the deficit. How concerned are you about rising deficits?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well if you look over the long term, if you look at, for example, at the Congressional Budget Office forecast of debts and deficits, they grow to the moon. They grow unsustainably, so at some point, those have to be addressed, and that is purely the domain of the Congress and the executive branch to negotiate how to do that. At some point they have to be addressed. And so our focus is whatever Congress and the administration decide to do, we have our goals. Our goals are 2% inflation and a strong labor market, maximum employment, and we will adjust our monetary policies to try to achieve that, but you're right. Over the long run, it's clear that the deficit needs to be addressed, but that is also, as I said, the domain of Congress and the executive branch to sort out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Goldman Sachs analysts were out this week with a report saying that the last time we saw Trump tariffs, the cost was passed along to consumers. They estimate every 5% increase in the tariff rate would reduce corporate earnings per share by one to two percent because it would pull back consumer spending, possibly trigger retaliatory tariffs and increased uncertainty. How much of a downside risk is there if we get into this business of tariffs?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, from an inflation perspective, it's pretty easy to model a one time tariff, so if somebody imposed a 1% tariff or a 10% tariff, you would think that that would increase prices of those goods either 1% or 10%. That's pretty easy to model, and it shouldn't have an effect long run on inflation. The challenge becomes, if there's a tit for tat. And it's one country imposing tariffs and then responses, and it's escalating, that's where it becomes more concerning, and, frankly, a lot more uncertain. So I think again, with, as is with fiscal policy, we'll have to wait and see what actually gets implemented, and then how other countries might respond to that. It's just right now we're just all guessing what will actually happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's safe to say that the new president will take office with what appears to be the economy trending upwards?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: The economy is strong. You know, when I reach out to businesses and labor unions all around my region, it's one of cautious optimism that the economy is doing well. There are jobs available, and we want to keep the economy doing well. We want to keep that growth going while we get inflation all the way back down to 2% and so right now, I would say we have a strong economy, and that's a really good thing, and our objective is to keep it there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chair Powell was asked this week at a press conference if he would resign if asked, he made clear he does not think that the law would require that, and in fact, it would violate the law. But there is a broader conversation right now about political influence on the Fed. Are you concerned about it?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: I'm not. My colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are totally committed to the dual mandate goals of 2% inflation and maximum employment that Congress has assigned us. That's what's driving the decisions that we've been making, and that will continue to do so. And there are also structural elements that are designed by Congress to provide continuity. So the governors at the Board of Governors in Washington serve up to 14 year terms. The presidents of the Reserve Banks are independent. These are structures that Congress put in place to provide continuity between that and I think, bipartisan support that we all want to get inflation back down to 2% and we want to keep the economy strong. I'm confident that we will continue to focus on our economic jobs, and that's what should be dictating what we're doing, and that is what's dictating what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Neel Kashkari, thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 10, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. Jake, good to have you here.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we know President Biden and President elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday. There are a lot of fires around the world. What is it that President Biden wants to deliver in terms of a focus and message?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, the first and most important message will be that President Biden is committed to the peaceful transfer of power and to a responsible handoff from one president to the next, which is in the best tradition of our country and has been for the last 240 years. And then they will go through the top issues, both domestic and foreign policy issues. Including what is happening in Europe and Asia and the Middle East. And the President will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things, where they stand and and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these- these issues when he takes office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's go to Ukraine, because we just heard from Senator Hagerty that world view from that portion of the Republican Party right now. We know the war is expanding there. The North Korean troops seem to have entered the fight. You have all these adversaries all-in on Russia winning there. What can you do in the remaining 70 days to sort of change what's happening on the ground, or Trump-proof the strategy, so to speak?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, look, our approach remains the same as it's been for the last two and a half years, which is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position on the battlefield, so that it is ultimately in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table. And it should be up to Ukraine to decide, for its own sovereignty and its own territorial integrity, when and how it goes to the negotiating table. It should be up to the United States and a coalition of nations that we have built to continue to supply Ukraine with the means to defend itself against brutal Russian aggression.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got like, what, $6 billion in money left that's already--",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: --And President Biden made clear when President Zelensky was here in Washington a couple of months ago that we would spend all of the resources that were provided to us by the Congress on time and in full. Meaning that by January 20, we will have sent the full amount of resources and aid to Ukraine the Congress has authorized. And of course, President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe. And ultimately, as the Japanese Prime Minister said, If we walk away from Ukraine in Europe, the question about America's commitment to our allies in Asia will grow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you mean President Biden is going to ask Congress to pass more money for Ukraine before he leaves office?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal. President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term, because the threat to Ukraine will remain no matter what exactly happens on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, and the United States should not walk away from its commitment, either to Ukraine or to 50 nations that we have rallied in defense of Ukraine in both Europe and Asia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So U.S. intelligence assessed that Russia favored Donald Trump in this election, that Russia interfered in a fairly dramatic and visible fashion with these fake videos. What consequence are they going to pay, if any, for doing that?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first, let's not forget that we are currently helping Ukraine fight Russia in Ukraine in the most dramatic and full throated way one could- could imagine. So we are already doing a substantial number of things to impose costs on Russia. We have also passed the most sweeping sanctions on Russia that we have seen against a major economy in the world--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Hagerty was saying it's- Russia's doing fine even with those sanctions.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first of all, you can see in many different ways, whether it's inflation in Russia, whether it's their ability over time to actually grow their economy, their technology, their capacity to invest in new sources of energy going down the line, that the picture for Russia looks increasingly bleak as time goes on, and that the sanctions are biting, they have not stopped, obviously, Russia from being able to carry out its military operations in Ukraine today, but they have painted a darker picture for Ukraine- for Russia tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what Russia is giving North Korea's Kim Jong Un in exchange for the men he is sending to fight on the battlefield in Ukraine?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: We don't know for sure, and frankly, I think Vladimir Putin doesn't know for sure. I think he probably hasn't decided exactly what he's going to do for North Korea on a going forward basis. But I will tell you this, Kim Jong Un expects that he's going to get something significant, probably in the form of military and technology support from Russia--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For its nuclear program?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: And that's a distinct possibility. I can't say exactly what will happen, but we have already heard the Russians come out and say that North Korea's nuclear program should be looked at differently today than it was five or ten years ago. So the concern about the relationship between Russia and North Korea, in both directions, is very real and something that all of the nations of the free world need to pay attention to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Prime Minister Netanyahu said he spoke to Donald Trump three times in the past few days. The Israeli President Isaac Herzog is coming to the White House. That was just announced. What makes you think in these final days of the Biden administration that Benjamin Netanyahu would agree to peace in Gaza or agree to peace in Lebanon and not hold on to that political capital for the new president?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Prime Minister Netanyahu will make his decisions, and he'll speak to his decisions. Here's what I see. First in Gaza, it really, today, is not Israel that is standing in the way of a cease fire and hostage deal. It is Hamas. Israel has said it's prepared to do a temporary cease fire for a number of hostages and then try to build on that to get all of the hostages home--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what--",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: --Hamas has said no",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Senator Hagerty was talking about on that with Hamas?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: I don't know about the particular statement he made. What I will tell you is, whatever Hamas is saying publicly, what they are communicating to the mediators is no, we will not do a cease fire and hostage deal at this time. So what we need to do is get the rest of the world to continue to increase pressure on Hamas to come to the table, to do a deal in Gaza, because the Israeli government has said it's prepared to take a temporary step in that direction. And then when it comes to Lebanon, we have been actively engaged in discussions with the Israeli government. Those should remain behind closed doors, but we do believe that at some point the Israeli government wants to do a deal that gets its citizens back home. I don't think it's doing that deal for American politics. I think it's doing that deal to try to secure Israel, and I expect that in the coming weeks, we will see progress in that direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you hold Israel to account? Because the Secretaries of State and Defense have sent letters saying that they're not allowing in aid to the degree they should, and that there are possibly forced displacements from Northern Gaza. On this program, you have said that was essentially a red line.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: So basically what you have seen from Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken is a letter to their Israeli counterparts that says, here is a set of steps we expect you to take, and we are going to measure you against the progress you are making towards those steps. This week, we will make our judgments about what kind of progress they have made. And then Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, the President will make judgments about what we do in response, and I'm not going to get ahead of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, President Xi and President Biden will be in the same place at these summits in the next few days. Will the President confront him about this pervasive and massive hacking of telecom companies known as 'Salt Typhoon?'",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: President Biden, every time he sees his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, speaks to him about cyber-enabled espionage, about cyber attacks--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a significant attack.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Yes, it is. It is an absolutely significant attack. It's something that the FBI, our Department of Homeland Security, our entire national security enterprise is digging into in a big way. And of course, it will be on the agenda between every American official and every Chinese official in the weeks ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Jake Sullivan, a lot happening in the world. Thank you for coming in and talking to us. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by Dame Karen Pierce, the UK's ambassador to the United States. Welcome back to Face The Nation.",
      "AMBASSADOR DAME KAREN PIERCE: Thank you very much. Margaret, nice to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Ambassador, after this election, there was a lot of chatter in Europe about Europe needing to act alone, or at least without as much of an American support mechanism there. The French president said \"Europe needs to take back control.\" Italy's Prime Minister said, \"Don't ask what the US can do for you, ask what Europe should do for itself.\" What do you think Trump's return will mean for Europe?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I think in all my experience Margaret, when America and Europe work together, that's when you get success. That's when you get coherence in policy. We saw that in the Balkans. We've seen it at every conflict since the 1990s. It's great that Europe wants to do more. We want to be a part of that. We've got a lot of burden sharing going on in Europe on Ukraine, I think perhaps it's not well understood in America, if I may say so, quite how much Europe is doing for Ukraine, and we want to talk about that with the incoming administration, as well as work with the Biden team to help Ukraine even further.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom, of course, has- has provided a tremendous amount of weaponry and support to Ukraine.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: That's exactly right. I think we're over $16 billion all-in. We provided the first tanks. We provided the first anti-tank weapons. We have trained Ukrainian pilots. We're going to go on supporting Ukraine for as long as they need us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you do that if the United States cuts off financial and military aid to Ukraine?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, we obviously hope that doesn't happen, and we're going to be wanting to have lots of conversations with the outgoing and incoming administrations on just how best to support Ukraine. I think we all want the same thing. We want a stable, secure, peaceful, Euro-Atlantic area. And if Putin is allowed to succeed in Ukraine, that threatens all of us, including the US, and it certainly emboldens China, and I don't think anyone in the US wants to see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on Friday, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is a problematic NATO ally. He's friends with Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, he said \"The situation on the front is obvious. There's been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war.\" He's talking about Ukraine. Do you think Mr. Trump is persuadable on this issue?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, I don't think it's for any single European leader to say what President Trump might do. I think we need to hear from President Trump after inauguration on what the new administration's plans are. But certainly I know they share our goal of wanting to have security and stability, and we'll be talking to them and the outgoing Biden administration to see how best we can support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Orban does speak with Donald Trump, but you don't get the sense that he is reflecting--",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: -- We speak to Donald Trump, the Prime Minister spoke to him very recently, on the Wednesday after- the day after the election. In my experience, President Trump is his own person. He'll listen to a lot of advice, some of it solicited, some of it unsolicited, and he'll weigh the pros and cons, and he'll come to his own decision. But I have always found him and his team very willing to listen to our point of view.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on the trade front, there's also concern in Europe, as I understand it, about what may be coming with tariffs. The Trump campaign has proposed a 10% across the board tariff on Europe. Goldman Sachs projects it will be perhaps a little bit more limited and focused on auto exports. Do you have a sense that the UK may be able to avoid this kind of financial penalty, essentially?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We would very much hope so. As- as the UK, you know, we've got free trade in our DNA, as it were. We don't believe in tariffs as an instrument of trade. We have a slightly different approach from many American trade specialists on that. And I think the last thing the world needs at the moment is a tariff war. That doesn't help anybody. Trade and investments are hugely important part of what we do with America, something like a trillion dollars goes backwards and forwards across the Atlantic in trade and investment each year. Let's not put that at risk. Let's try and find out how we can work together to increase investment and trade. And there's also the really important issue of economic security that's now come onto the agenda, and we'll be wanting to talk to the incoming administration about that also.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you served here in Washington during the first Trump administration. You know many of these players. The current UK Government is a different one, of course, from that period of time with the Labor Party in charge. I have to ask you about that direct relationship, because the top diplomat, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, years ago, and you know this quote, wrote \"Trump is not only a woman hating neo-Nazi sympathizing sociopath, he's a profound threat to the international order.\" Are you concerned that those past statements and the ideological differences will be a problem in what has been a special relationship?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I don't think the past statements will be a problem, to be absolutely honest, Margaret. Politicians say a lot of things on both sides. And even in America, some people who are now in the Trump administration, or will be in the Trump administration, like the Vice President-Elect, have also said critical things about President Trump. In my experience, politicians kind of absorb those sorts of comments as part of the wear and tear of political life. What's important is the relationship now. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, the Prime Minister Keir Starmer, had a very warm dinner with President Trump in September. He very graciously invited them to his private home in Trump Tower. We discussed a huge range of issues. You're right that they come from different political philosophies. I wouldn't call them ideological. I don't think Keir Starmer is ideological, and I don't think President Trump is. It's about finding out how we can work together. What they do have in common is this desire to get the economies moving, to get growth for the ordinary citizen, to make sure things are better for the ordinary citizen. And we had a very good conversation about that with President Trump in September.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the UK politicians who was at Mar-a-Lago and celebrating on election night was Nigel Farage. He's known for his anti-immigrant stance. There has been, not just in the US, but also in Europe, around the world, this backlash against immigrants and migration, and that has really impacted a lot of politics here. I'm wondering what your thoughts are, more broadly, about what kind of political force and factor that is in the world we're in now? It's a big question, but it does seem like there's something global happening.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I'd agree with you, Margaret, there's something very important for a lot of electorates 'round the world about the subject of immigration. But I don't want to give the impression that in the west or in the UK we are not generous to people in need. We took a lot of Syrians, a lot of Afghans, a lot of Ukrainians. Economic migration is the thing we're all very worried about. And although the problem manifests itself differently in the UK from in the US, I think you're right. It is something that voters care about. It is something that the British Government is committed to tackling. The Prime Minister is very interested in how you act against the criminal gangs who foster this sort of migration, and actually are the ones exploiting people who come across in small boats or whatever conveyance they use. It's about stopping the gangs and stopping the traffickers, and we'll need a lot of international coordination to make that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Pierce, thank you for your time today.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Thank you very much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back."

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 13:50:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Victims thought to be female were male and not related to one another, showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\"They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \"We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\"",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",
      "In August, archaeologists at Pompeii announced they had unearthed the remains of two more victims -- a man and a woman discovered inside what was likely the bedroom of their home, where they'd become trapped as the rest of the structure filled with debris. The woman was found on the bed with a collection of gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as a pair of gold earrings, a pair of pearl earrings and other jewelry.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers won a $700,000 prize for using artificial intelligence to read a 2,000-year-old scroll that was scorched in the Vesuvius eruption.",
      "The Herculaneum papyri consist of about\u00a0800 rolled-up Greek scrolls\u00a0that were carbonized during the 79 CE volcanic eruption that buried the ancient Roman town, according to the organizers of the\u00a0\"Vesuvius Challenge.\"",
      "The scroll's author was \"probably Epicurean philosopher Philodemus,\" writing \"about music, food, and how to enjoy life's pleasures,\" wrote contest organizer\u00a0Nat Friedman\u00a0on social media.",
      "The scrolls were found in a villa thought to be previously owned by Julius Caesar's patrician father-in-law, whose mostly unexcavated property held a library that could contain thousands more manuscripts.",

    "summary": "Medical issues aside, the astronauts described a water leak in June that triggered a blizzard in the International Space Station's airlock.",
    "story": [
      "Three NASA astronauts who just wrapped up a 235-day mission to the International Space Station discussed their flight with reporters Friday, but steadfastly refused to comment on a medical issue of some sort that resulted in one astronaut spending the night in a hospital after landing.",
      "The unidentified astronaut flew back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston the day after splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico on Oct. 25, rejoining their crewmates. But NASA, citing medical privacy issues, provided no details other than to say the astronaut \"is in good health and will resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members.\"",
      "\"I know there may be some interest in our post-flight medical event, where we diverted to a hospital,\" Crew 8 pilot Mike Barratt, a physician-astronaut, told reporters Friday. \"You know, space flight is still something we don't fully understand. We're finding things that we don't expect sometimes, and this was one of those times.",
      "\"We're still piecing things together on this. And so to maintain medical privacy and to let our processes go forward in an orderly manner, this is all we're going to say about that event at this time.\"",
      "Barratt, Crew 8 commander Matt Dominick, astronaut Jeanette Epps and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on March 3 and docked at the space station two days later. They returned to Earth last month after an extended stay in space.",
      "Barratt, Dominick and Epps all appeared healthy and in good spirits Friday as they continue their re-adjustment to gravity. Grebenkin flew back to Moscow shortly after splashdown, but in a social media post just after the crew's return to Earth, he was smiling and said to be in good shape.",
      "While the presumably minor medical issue remains a mystery, the crew shared highlights of their stay in space, including details about a water leak during preparations for a June spacewalk that triggered a blizzard in the space station's airlock.",
      "After a spacesuit \"discomfort\" problem forced Dominick and astronaut Tracy Dyson to call off a planned spacewalk on June 13, Dyson and Barratt suited up for another excursion on June 24.",
      "While floating in the airlock with the outer hatch open to space, an umbilical failed to \"seat\" properly and water began spewing into the chamber.",
      "\"Oh, my goodness,\" Dyson said when she noticed the water spewing out. \"There's a lot of water flowing. There's literally water everywhere. ... I've got ice all over my helmet.\"",
      "\"It was not a trivial leak,\" Barratt reflected Friday. \"Anybody who was watching NASA TV at the time could see there was basically a snowstorm, a blizzard spewing from the air lock, because we already had the hatch open. We were seeing flakes of ice in the air lock. Tracy was seeing a lot of them on her helmet, on her gloves, whatnot.",
      "\"So it was...dramatic is the right word, to be real honest. I think literally, Tracy's actions were nowhere short of a heroic to be able to re-mate that umbilical with her hands covered with ice and kind of being vision impaired and getting the air lock closed.\"",
      "Barratt said he grabbed her space-suited legs so Dyson could \"lever that thing closed, and she just made it happen. So yeah, there was a bit of drama. Everything worked out fine. And again, normal processes and procedures saved our bacon.\"",
      "NASA plans to resume spacewalks in January, and Barratt said the suits will be in good shape.",
      "\"I think we're leaving them a brand new umbilical, a really clean interface on that side where we had the problem and the suits are charged and really ready to go,\" he said. \"So I think we are more than ready for the next EVA campaign. I just wish we were doing it.\"",
      "That said, he pointed out, \"none of our spacesuits are spring chickens. And so we will expect to see some hardware issues with repeated use. So again, it's one of those things that we are always, at every second, ready to stop...or work a contingency procedure.\"",
      "As for the suit \"discomfort\" issue that Dominick reported prior to the earlier spacewalk attempt, no details were provided.",

    "story": [
      "By the time the polls opened on Election Day, baseless claims of voter fraud had been building on social media for months, fueling doubts about the integrity of the election.",
      "Posts proliferated on X and other platforms pointing to hiccups like technical issues with voting machines, power outages and spelling errors on ballots as examples of a supposedly brewing conspiracy. And at 4:30 p.m. on Election Day, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that there was \"a lot of talk about massive cheating\" in Pennsylvania \u2014 which officials said had \"no factual basis whatsoever.\"",
      "But as the votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to a decisive victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle, researchers say.",
      "\"I think this shows that these narratives are pushed when they serve a purpose, and they are stage setting often for efforts to dispute unfavorable results,\" said Max Read, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. \"And then once that stage setting and those claims are no longer needed, they're not pushed anymore.\"",
      "The shift was stark in Elon Musk's \"Election Integrity Community,\" a group of nearly 65,000 started by the platform owner's political action committee encouraging members to report \"voter fraud or irregularities.\"",
      "The group had already become a repository for speculation and unfounded rumors before Election Day. When the polls opened, hundreds of posts an hour were shared until the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, when the race was called for Trump in Pennsylvania, all but eliminating a winning path for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "After that, the posting drastically diminished.",
      "Read's team at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also found that mentions across the platform of voting machines in Pennsylvania and Michigan soared on Tuesday afternoon but dropped to hardly any by Wednesday morning.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a software error caused voting machines to be temporarily down in Cambria County, a county in southwestern Pennsylvania with a population of about 131,000. Voters used paper ballots and a court order extended voting hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. But some on social media baselessly suggested the technical issues were something nefarious, a plot to discard votes in a county Trump won by a wide margin in both of the last two elections.",
      "Danielle Lee Tomson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public's research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state's election headquarters. Claims that the errors were intentional fueled a lawsuit challenging the results that was later dismissed.",
      "\"On Election Day, we can always expect there to be irregularities or glitches or problems at polling sites,\" Tomson said. \"The question is will those issues be contorted into a larger narrative that election fraud is happening.\"",
      "While the volume of election rumors has drastically decreased, false claims are still spreading about races that have not yet been called. In Arizona, where Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake trails Democratic candidate Ruben Gallego, social users on the right are using the fact that Gallego had more votes than Harris by Friday to cast doubt on the validity of his lead.",
      "Meanwhile, turnout numbers are being twisted by both the left and the right to cast doubt on election results. While millions of votes are still being counted, some point to higher turnout in 2020 as evidence that there are 20 million \"missing votes.\" On the right, some claim this is evidence that 2020 was stolen from Trump; on the left, some say it's grounds for a recount.",
      "But the volume of posts questioning Harris's loss was nowhere near the \"Stop the Steal\" efforts that followed Trump's 2020 election loss, according to both Tomson and Read's research. No elected officials cast doubt on the outcome the way Trump pushed election denial when he lost in 2020. Harris urged all Americans to accept the results of the election in her concession speech on Wednesday.",
      "\"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,\" Harris said. \"And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.\"",

While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",

      "Waves of U.S. Capitol riot defendants are citing Donald Trump's election in requests to delay their criminal prosecutions because of his public pledge to pardon some of the people convicted of crimes on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "In court filings reviewed by CBS News, defense attorneys asked federal judges in Washington, D.C., to postpone proceedings in some of the Jan. 6 cases until 2025, when President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "The filings complicate the Justice Department's ability to conclude its prosecutions \u2014 hundreds of which remain active \u2014 before the changeover in power.",
      "William Pope, a Jan. 6 defendant from Kansas, has filed a new request for a delay, blistering the Justice Department for continuing apace with his prosecution.\u00a0Pope's filing cited Trump's reelection, arguing, \"Any further action in these cases is not an 'administration of justice' in the public interest as the government claims, but a belligerent disregard for the will of the American people, from which all law and governmental power in this country is derived.\"",
      "In a new request to delay his sentencing, defendant Terry Allen's attorneys filed a motion saying, \"History has shown that President Donald Trump is not shy when it comes to exercising his pardon powers and there is clearly no reason to believe he won't do as he says.\" Allen's attorneys noted that in Trump's first term, he \"pardoned, commuted, or rescinded the convictions of 237 people,\" and \"[m]any were controversial.\"",
      "Some defendants are quoting Trump's campaign statements in their new court filings. Attorneys for defendant Larry Brock argued that Trump \"explicitly campaigned on justice for the January 6 defendants.\" They cited Trump's July 31 interview with the National Association of Black Journalists, in which he said he'd \"'absolutely' pardon those convicted in the January 6th prosecutions because 'they were convicted by a very tough system.'\" They also quoted Trump's claim about Jan. 6 convicts: \"'[S]ome call them prisoners. I call them hostages...release the J6 hostages, Joe. Release them, Joe. You can do it real easy, Joe.'\"",
      "Brock, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, was accused of rifling through papers on the desks of senators while amid the mob.",
      "Defense attorney Joseph McBride, who has defended several Jan. 6 criminal defendants told CBS News that requests would be made \"across the board\" to delay cases until Trump takes office. \"It would be foolish not to,\" he said. \"The Justice Department Is still arresting people, which is nuts and pointless. The pardon thing is looming. And I don't think any of these prosecutions will continue beyond (Trump taking office).\"",
      "Former federal prosecutor Scott Fredericksen told CBS News he thinks the Justice Department is going to be forced to confront the question of what to do with the cases.",
      "\"The department will probably say, 'We're going to continue with the cases,' and that the discussion of pardons is not sufficient to warrant delays,\" Fredricksen said.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately return requests for comment. In court filings, it has opposed requests for delays. In the case of Terry Allen, prosecutors disagreed that a continuance of the case was warranted because \"the defendant's justification at this time is mere speculation.\"",
      "\"The Court should proceed as it would in any other prosecution,\" prosecutors argued. \"Courts in this jurisdiction have denied similar motions.\"",
      "Opposing a request to delay the trial of defendant Stephen Baker, the Justice Department argued, \"There is a public interest in the prompt and efficient administration of justice. The government and the Court have endeavored to deliver that interest. The government disagrees that a continuance is warranted here, and the Court should proceed as it would in any other prosecution.\"",
      "But the numbers of delay requests are expected to grow significantly. McBride, the New York-based defense attorney, told CBS News requests are expected by all similarly situated defendants. He said defense attorneys must argue for all of their clients and may not \"pick and choose\" to ask for delays only for some.",
      "In his court filing, Pope included a photo of himself standing next to Trump.",
      "\"It is now up to the Court to decide if it wishes to expend judicial resources by enduring a taxing schedule in this case,\" the filing said. \"Ultimately, I will get the same result with a trial or with no trial.\"",
      "The Justice Department has launched over 1,500 criminal cases in its prosecution of the Capitol siege.\u00a0 According to federal records, approximately 950 defendants have pleaded guilty, and 200 more have been found guilty at trial.",
      "Arrests continue, including new cases unsealed over the past few weeks.",
      "Fredericksen said a Trump-appointed attorney general could move to have the department dismiss pending Jan. 6 cases \u2014 and could opt to reopen and dismiss cases against those who have already been convicted and sentenced to prison.",

    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Last week,\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0announced his campaign co-chair Susie Wiles will serve as his White House chief of staff, the first woman \u2014 Republican or Democrat \u2014 ever to hold that position. Calling her \"tough, smart, innovative..., universally admired and respected,\" Trump credited her with helping him win both the 2024 and 2016 elections.",
      "Behind the scenes",
      "Wiles is known as a formidable political operative who prefers to work behind the scenes, rather than on any stage \u2014 or in front of cameras. In keeping with that, when Trump\u00a0declared victory\u00a0in the early hours of last Wednesday morning, he invited her to come to the microphones, but she politely declined.",
      "She's managed to not just curry favor, but more critically, to remain in good standing with Trump, winning his trust while working in a high-profile campaign role, managing the ambitions, personalities and egos in Trump's orbit.",
      "Relationship with campaign staff",
      "Wiles is beloved by the Trump campaign staff, many of whom call her a mentor.",
      "\"Susie Wiles is a tremendous advocate for President Trump and a great boss to those that work for her,\" said Trump senior adviser Danielle Alvarez. \"She knows how to bring people together.\"",
      "\"For myself and countless others, having Susie Wiles as a mentor and a friend is a gift,\" said Brian Hughes, another senior adviser. \"The nation will see that with President Trump in the White House with Susie as the COS the next four years will be America's best.\"",
      "Those who have worked for Wiles \"will take a bullet for Susie,\" said Carlos Trujillo, a campaign adviser who served as U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States. Trujillo said most people don't see Wiles' motherly and grandmotherly side. \"She always made sure her people were taken care of,\" he said. \"She's very soft spoken, but she holds everyone accountable, and it's always done through love and kindness but never a place of hate.\"",
      "Management style",
      "Staffers say Wiles runs a tight and focused ship. Trump's 2024 campaign did not go through the big, dramatic shakeups or infighting that characterized his previous campaigns. Wiles' appointment signals that as president-elect, he wants to run his administration in a similar way.",
      "Wiles' legacy, Trujillo said, is her ability to cultivate talent. \"Susie in politics is the greatest coach of all time...she's going to be able to recruit the best talent.\"",
      "And while Wiles shies away from the spotlight, she made a rare comment on X when businessman Mark Cuban, in an interview on ABC's \"The View,\" accused Trump of not associating with \"strong, intelligent women.\" In response, Wiles\u00a0posted\u00a0for the first time this year: \"I'm told [Mark Cuban] needs help identifying the strong and intelligent women surrounding Pres. Trump. Well, here we are!\"",
      "Background",
      "After Trump won the 2016 election, Wiles, who was the chief strategist in Florida for his campaign, was dispatched in late September of 2018 to help Ron DeSantis with his 2018 bid to be Florida governor. At the time, he was trailing Democrat Andrew Gillum in several polls.",
      "After helping DeSantis win, however, Wiles was shut out of his inner circle, according to\u00a0The Atlantic's Tim Alberta. Wiles told Alberta that working for DeSantis was the \"biggest mistake\" of her career. She returned to the Trump campaign and ran his Florida campaign in 2020, and then after his loss, she went on to run Trump's Save America PAC.",
      "As Trump's 2024 co-campaign manager, Wiles, along with Chris LaCivita, hatched a plan to recruit, register and turn out Trump's low-propensity voters, Alberta reported. During the primary campaign, they pursued people in the reddest areas of the country who liked Trump but weren't habitual voters and in many cases, weren't even registered to vote. During the general campaign, Wiles and LaCivita raised a volunteer army to take on the legions of canvassers paid by Kamala Harris' cash-rich coffers.",
      "Wiles is a native of New Jersey, the daughter of renowned the late NFL kicker and sportscaster Pat Summerall. Soon after she graduated from college at the University of Maryland, she worked for Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign, and later went on to work in Florida politics. In 2010, she helped Sen. Rick Scott win his election against Democrat Bill McCollum, and she has also been a political consultant in Florida.",

    "title": "Here's what to know about House bill to expand Social Security benefits",
    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Measure that would repeal so-called \"government pensions offset\" has been gaining support in House.",
    "story": [
      "The House is expected to try to pass a Social Security-related bill this week to ensure benefits for workers who are also eligible for other pensions, despite a surprise move by hard-right Freedom Caucus leaders to derail the effort.",
      "It's a quick turnaround to salvage what had been a bipartisan effort to pass the bill, called the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, during what's now the lame-duck post-election period of the Congress.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal the so-called \"government pensions offset,\" or GPO, which reduces Social Security spousal or widow(er) benefits for those who receive noncovered pensions, according to the Social Security Administration's\u00a0website.",
      "The summary also says the bill also eliminates the so-called \"windfall elimination provision\" that \"in some instances reduces Social Security benefits for individuals who also receive a pension or disability benefit from an employer that did not withhold Social Security taxes.\"",
      "Such pensions are paid by employers \u2014 typically, state and local governments or non-U.S. employers \u2014 that do not withhold Social Security taxes from employee salaries.",
      "\"The GPO reduces the spousal or widow(er) benefit by two-thirds of the monthly non-covered pension and can partially, or fully, offset an individual's spousal/widow(er) benefit, depending on the amount of the non-covered pension,\" according to SSA.gov.",
      "The bill would repeal the GPO provision and reinstate full Social Security benefits.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, an individual with a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security, who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension, would see their Social Security benefit reduced by $667, or two-thirds the non-covered pension amount. That leaves them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit.",
      "If the GPO measure is repealed, the same individual would be entitled to the entire $900 spousal benefit amount without an offset reduction.",
      "Does the bill have bipartisan support?",
      "Yes, the bill was introduced by a Republican, Rep. Garrett Graves of Louisiana, and a Democrat, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and it has gained support in the House. A robust 300 lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have signed on to it.",
      "Other groups have also supported the bill, such as the National Association of Counties, which represents county governments. That group says that eliminating the GPO would help county governments recruit workers at a time when many are facing labor shortages.",
      "What happened next to the bill?",
      "To force the legislation forward, the sponsors of the bill, Rep. Graves and Rep. Spanberger, this fall used a rarely successful process called a discharge petition.",
      "They collected the minimum 218 signatures needed from House lawmakers to dislodge the bill from committee and send it to the floor for a vote.",
      "The move is often seen as an affront to House leaders, particularly the House speaker and the majority leader who determine the floor schedule.",
      "But Spanberger and Graves \u2014 who both did not seek reelection \u2014 had little to lose. Besides, Johnson backed the bill before becoming speaker.",
      "Did the House Freedom Caucus block the Social Security bill?",
      "Two leaders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus intervened when the rest of Congress was away from Capitol Hill, mostly in home states for Election Day.",
      "The Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., and former chair Rep. Bob Goode, R-Va., used a routine pro forma session of the House on Nov.\u00a05 to swiftly table part of the measure.",
      "The Freedom Caucus tends to block new spending. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add some $196 billion to the federal deficit over a decade.",
      "Graves said that's the amount people are missing out on without reinstating full Social Security benefits.",
      "But in tabling the legislation the conservatives actually set back its procedural rule, but not the bill itself.",
      "The legislation is expected to move forward with a House vote anyway, possibly in the week ahead.",
      "Could the Social Security Fairness Act still pass?",
      "Yes, but that said, passage will now be tougher, requiring a supermajority threshold rather than a simple majority as had been planned under the rule that the Freedom Caucus leaders turned back.",
      "If it passes the House, it's unclear if the bill has enough support to clear the Senate. But the wide margin in the House indicates potentially broad support.",
      "It would then go to President Joe Biden's desk. If signed into law, the summary says the changes are effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",

    "summary": "Medicare's Part B monthly premium is outpacing both inflation and Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment.",
    "story": [
      "America's seniors will pay more for their health care in the new year, as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has announced that premiums for its Part B plan will increase by about 6% in 2025.",
      "Part B covers visits to doctors, outpatient care, preventative services such as vaccines, medical equipment like wheelchairs as well as home health care. (Part A, which covers inpatient care in hospitals and other facilities, is premium-free for all but about 1% of beneficiaries due to taxes paid by most retirees while they worked.)",
      "What is the Medicare Part B premium for 2025?",
      "The standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B enrollees will climb by $10.30, or about 6%, to $185.00 from $174.70 in 2024, CMS said\u00a0Friday.",
      "Meanwhile, the annual deductible for all Medicare Part B beneficiaries will rise to $257 in 2025 from $240.",
      "The reason for the 2025 premium and deductible increases is due to \"projected price changes and assumed utilization increases that are consistent with historical experience,\" according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "The premium stood at $164.90 in 2023, when the cost fell just over $5 from the year before, a rare decline.",
      "How does that compare with the Social Security COLA?",
      "Medicare's Part B premiums have generally outrun inflation as well as Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA).",
      "Yearly inflation climbed 2.4% in September, while the Social Security COLA for next year will be 2.5%, or an average of $50 more per household.",
      "What do higher-income Medicare enrollees pay?",
      "Given that a beneficiary's Part B monthly premium is based on one's income, wealthier Americans also pay an Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount, or IRMAA, which impacts about 8% of those with Medicare Part B, CMS stated.",
      "Those who are married and lived with their spouses at any time during the year, but who file separate tax returns with modified adjusted gross income of $106,000 or less, will pay just the Medicare Part B premium of $185.00 a month.\u00a0Beneficiaries with incomes above $106,000 but below $394,000 are looking at paying IRMAA of $406.90 plus the standard $185.00, or $591.90 a month.\u00a0Seniors with incomes in excess of $394,000 will pay $443.90 in IRMAA and the standard $185.00, or a total of $628.90 a month.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 15:57:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump wants his people in place in his administration as soon as possible.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday that he's appointing a \"border czar,\" former Immigrations and Customs Enforcement director and immigration hardliner Tom Homan, to join his administration. Homan, however, may not be the only such \"czar\" in the Trump administration.",
      "\"I am pleased to announce that the Former ICE Director, and stalwart on Border Control, Tom Homan, will be joining the Trump Administration, in charge of our Nation's Borders (\"The Border Czar\"), including, but not limited to, the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The term \"czar\" is shorthand for a high-level executive branch official in charge of a specific policy focus.",
      "They aren't Senate-confirmed positions",
      "The \"czar\" role is one that allows a president to step over the pesky checks and balances of the three branches of government. \"Czar\" roles aren't Senate-confirmed cabinet positions, like say, the secretary of state or Health and Human Services secretary. That means a president can appoint that person to his administration without the Senate's input, and quickly.",
      "Trump wants to put his people in place, and quickly, after experiencing in his first term how congressional authority can gum up an administration's plans. Trump said as much in a social media post on Sunday.",
      "\"Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more,\" Trump wrote Sunday, saying he wants recess appointments. \"This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again. We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\"",
      "Trump wouldn't be the first president to use \"czars\"",
      "Trump would not be the first president to use \"czars.\" Such czars have been appointed by presidents of both parties. Former President Barack Obama had, in part, an \"energy and environment czar,\" \"Afghanistan czar,\" \"car czar,\" \"health czar\" and \"auto recovery czar.\"",
      "His use of these positions was so widespread that in 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the history and legality of executive branch czars. The committee noted that some of these policy czars were at one point confirmed by the Senate, while others were in positions outside the White House that reported to a Senate-confirmed officer. But a handful worked in the White House. The use of such \"czars\" ignited a firestorm of criticism from Republicans, and even some Democrats raised concerns about their authority.",
      "But presidents before Obama had \"czars,\" too. President Bill Clinton had a \"Y2K czar,\" and President George W. Bush had an \"AIDS czar,\" \"counterterrorism czar\" and \"reading czar,\" among others. Historians believe the role dates back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, who rapidly expanded the size and role of the federal government.",
      "Trump also had something of a \"czar\" in his first term. Moncef Slaoui, a former pharmaceutical executive, oversaw Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's initiative to fast-track COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "During the Obama administration, Republicans blasted the growth of the administrative state, and decisions made by unelected bureaucrats. And during the Trump administration, Trump supporters bemoaned the so-called \"deep state\" of unelected career officers.",
      "Vice President Harris was sometimes dubbed a \"border czar,\" although not by President Biden himself, since the president tasked her with tackling the influx of migrants at the southern border. Harris fought against that label as the Democratic nominee.",
      "A \"czar\" position could make room for controversial names like RFK, Jr.",
      "The Senate will be controlled by Republicans when Trump takes office. But Trump still may have trouble confirming a few of the most controversial names, like vaccine denier Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to Senate-confirmed Cabinet positions.",
      "Kennedy\u00a0is on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the\u00a0president-elect's\u00a0campaign said. But it's also possible Kennedy could serve in a less formal role, like a \"czar.\"",
      "Where did the concept of \"czars\" originate?",
      "\"Czar\" comes from the Russian word \"tsar,\" which is derived from the Latin word \"caesar,\" according to World History Encyclopedia. Specifically, the term tsar refers to Russia's rulers for hundreds of years. Ivan IV The Terrible was formally crowned the \"tsar of all Russia\" in 1547, and the title continued until Russia's monarchy was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917.",
      "Franklin D. Roosevelt, who greatly expanded the size and scope of the federal government, used \"czars.\" But even before his time in office, the first use of the phrase \"czar\" in the U.S. was likely Nicholas Biddle, tapped to be president of the Bank of the United States during Andrew Jackson's presidency. He was sometimes called \"Czar Nicholas,\" which overlapped with Russia's Czar Nicholas I's reign.",
      "Over time, the term in U.S. came to be used informally for people handpicked by the president for principal positions who don't undergo Senate vetting, scrutiny or confirmation.",
      "What are the pros and cons of \"czars\"?",
      "Critics of such roles have argued \"czars\" run amock of the checks and balances system the forefathers founded. The late Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd criticized both Obama and Bush for creating such roles in their administrations.",
      "\"The rapid and easy accumulation of power by White House staff can threaten the Constitutional system of checks and balances,\" Byrd wrote in a publicized letter to Obama in 2009. \"At the worst, White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.\"",
      "The president can, of course, appoint White House employees. The constitutional issues come into question when the president selects a principal who isn't Senate-confirmed.",
      "But for a president looking to appoint an ally quickly, a \"czar\" is logistically much easier to get into office than is a Cabinet secretary.",
      "How effective a \"czar\" can really be is up for debate \u2014 especially since \"czars\" generally don't control budgets.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 15:38:01 -0500",
    "summary": "A kayaker reported missing from Green Lake, Wisconsin, in August is now thought to have faked his own disappearance and fled the country to Europe.",
    "story": [
      "Authorities in Wisconsin believe a kayaker missing since August did not actually vanish while out on a lake, instead faking his own disappearance and fleeing the country. The discovery came after search teams had probed the deep waters of central Wisconsin's Green Lake for 54 days in hopes of locating 45-year-old Ryan Borgwardt, said Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll at a news conference Friday that was streamed by CBS News affiliate WFRV-TV.",
      "Borgwardt was initially reported missing Aug. 12, according to the sheriff. Authorities who responded to the report found the man's car and trailer parked on the bank of the lake, and a capsized kayak that apparently belonged to him in an area where the water was about 220 feet deep.",
      "Keith Cormican, of a nonprofit search-and-rescue organization called Bruce's Legacy, helped multiple law enforcement agencies over the course of several months to try and find Borgwardt. Cormican had searched essentially every corner of the western part of Green Lake by early October, and although he told the sheriff he was not prepared to give up, Podoll recalled regrouping with his detectives on Oct. 7 and deciding to take the investigation in \"a different direction.\"",
      "They learned shortly afterward that Canadian authorities had checked Borgwardt's name on Aug. 13, according to the sheriff's office. The investigation so far indicates border officials in Canada checked the name, said Green Lake Chief Deputy Matt Vandekolk.",
      "\"That was something we didn't expect,\" Podoll told reporters Friday.",
      "Vandelkolk told CBS News the fact that Borgrwardt's name was checked by law enforcement in Canada after he seemingly went missing \"caught our attention,\" because it meant \"he had contact with Canadian law enforcement in some way, shape or form.\"",
      "\"We've still got to work out all the specifics of that with the Canadian government,\" said Vandelkolk.",
      "Partnering with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in addition to state and local investigators in Wisconsin, authorities began to uncover more evidence suggesting Borgwardt may not have drowned in the lake at all, Podoll said Friday. A forensic analysis of a laptop that Borgwardt's wife had given to investigators raised suspicions he had engineered the disappearance in order to flee to some place in Europe.",
      "Analysts determined Borgwardt had replaced the laptop's hard drive before he vanished and cleared its browsing history on the day of the fated kayaking trip, after syncing the laptop's contents to the Cloud on Aug 11. He had also photographed his passports and taken out a $375,000 life insurance policy in the months leading up to his disappearance. Authorities also said Borgwardt had moved funds into a foreign bank, changed his email address and was communicating with a woman in Uzbekistan prior to going missing.",
      "\"Due to these discoveries of new evidence, we were sure that Ryan was not in our lake,\" said Podoll. \"The expertise of Kieth Cormican of Bruce's Legacy cannot be overstated. His dedication and persistence in searching efforts was remarkable, and initially his confidence that he could not find a body in the western part of our lake drew us in a direction that we were not looking.\"",
      "Podoll asked the public to report any information they may have on Borgwardt's disappearance to the Green Lake Sheriff's Office or the local Crime Stoppers line. He told reporters it was too early to comment on any charges that could potentially be brought against Borgwardt and anyone who might have helped him, if he is found, although the sheriff emphasized that recovering the expenses used to search for him would be a priority.",
      "\"Ryan, if you are viewing this, I plead that you contact us or your family,\" Podoll said. \"We understand that things can happen but there is a family that wants their daddy back.\"",
      "Vandelkolk told CBS News that Brogwardt has three children. Two are in high school and one is in seventh grade, he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Senate Republicans prepare to vote Wednesday on new leadership for the upcoming Congress, President-elect Donald Trump is already weighing in with demands for the new majority leader regarding his Cabinet.",
      "After a decisive victory in the 2024 elections, Trump is returning to the White House with a GOP-led Senate at his side. Senate Republican leaders are expected to ease the way for the president-elect's agenda and his Cabinet and judicial nominees. Trump has made it clear that he'd like his nominees to be installed immediately, suggesting that he may want the option to bypass the Senate's advice and consent role entirely.",
      "Trump weighs in on recess appointments",
      "Perhaps the biggest factor remaining in the leadership race is whether Trump himself weighs in on the candidates. On Sunday, he stepped into the conversation, demanding in a Truth Social post that anyone seeking the position as leader \"must agree to Recess Appointments.\"",
      "Recess appointments enable a president to temporarily install nominees without the Senate confirmation process. Trump argued in a post on social media that without recess appointments, \"we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner.\"",
      "\"We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\" the president-elect said.",
      "The Constitution's Recess Appointment Clause grants presidents the ability to \"fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate.\" The maneuver is considered to be a way to make swift appointments during the Senate's absence, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service, which notes that recess appointments have also been used for political reasons \u2014 for instance, to make an appointment on a temporary basis for an individual who would not be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "With a GOP majority of at least 52 seats, Trump shouldn't have too much difficulty getting his nominations through the chamber through the regular process. But pushback from a handful of Republicans like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Todd Young of Indiana or Sen.-elect John Curtis of Utah could imperil some of his more controversial picks. The process could also be delayed by Democrats in the minority, who could rely on procedural maneuvers to extend the time it takes for Trump's Cabinet to be confirmed.",
      "But the recess appointment maneuver is a controversial one that both parties have combated in recent years. Recess appointments are allowed only when the Senate is out of session for 10 days. For the last decade, both chambers have headed off recess appointments by going into pro-forma sessions even when lawmakers are in recess. And a Supreme Court decision in 2014 gave the Senate more authority to prevent the maneuver, after controversial recess appointments by President Barack Obama.",
      "If Trump were to make an appointment during a recess in the first session of the new Congress, the appointment could last for almost two years, after which the individual could be appointed again through a recess appointment or the regular process, according to the CRS report. But without the Senate's approval, the appointee would not be paid.",
      "Should Republicans force a change to procedure in the upper chamber, they would do so with the risk that Democrats will take the same steps in their favor when they regain the majority. Still, all three candidates for GOP leader threw their support behind Trump's demand for recess appointments on Sunday.",
      "The candidates for Senate majority leader",
      "Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, are considered the front-runners in the race to replace Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. But Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has seen a surge of support from members of Trump's orbit \u2014 from Tucker Carlson to Elon Musk \u2014 that has drawn increased attention to the race.",
      "Thune, 63, is currently the No. 2 Republican and considered by some to be the favorite in the race. He's been in the Senate since 2004 and served as GOP whip since 2021. But he hasn't always had a strong relationship with Trump, and initially backed Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina for president in the GOP primaries.",
      "Cornyn, 72, has been in the Senate since 2002 and previously served as the Republican whip from 2013 to 2019. His fundraising chops have made him a top candidate in the Senate leadership race. But like Thune, he's previously distanced himself from Trump \u2014 a gap both senators have sought to close in recent months.",
      "Meanwhile, Scott has been angling for the position. The Florida Republican challenged McConnell for the role after the midterm elections in 2022, when he earned the support of just 10 members of his conference. Scott is similarly expected to find support from some of the conference's conservative members in this year's contest, and the outside endorsements from those who claim Cornyn and Thune are too close to McConnell could be a boon.",
      "Electing the \"next generation of leadership\"",
      "The leadership election comes after McConnell's decision to step away after 17 years at the helm, becoming the longest serving Senate leader in history.",
      "McConnell's decision to step aside and welcome \"the next generation of leadership\" teed up a high-stakes race for leader that has been shaking out behind the scenes since February. After Republicans flipped the Senate, the leadership race took on even greater importance.",
      "\"I had really hoped I'd be able to hand over to my successor the majority,\" McConnell told reporters at a news conference last week. \"I've been the majority leader, I've been the minority leader \u2013 majority's a lot better.\"",
      "Outside influence and endorsements",
      "The race, nine months in the making, has begun to draw input from outsiders in recent days. Tucker Carlson, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are among the Trump loyalists who have weighed in to back Scott, urging that he is best suited to carry out the president-elect's agenda.",
      "How the input from prominent outsiders weighs on the race remains to be seen. Senate Republicans will meet behind closed doors to elect the new leader, casting secret ballots, which make senators less likely to be swayed by external pressures.",
      "For months, the three candidates have been working behind the scenes to persuade their colleagues to back them for the chamber's top post. And so far, just a small portion of the Republican conference has shared publicly who they plan to support.",
      "Thune has the backing of Sens. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, along with Steve Daines of Montana, who chaired the GOP campaign arm, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, this cycle and may have valuable sway with new members whose races he buoyed. Meanwhile, Cornyn has the support of Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. And Scott has the backing of Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. In recent days, he also earned endorsements from Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee \u2014 two senators who have been floated as possible picks for Trump's cabinet.",
      "The bulk of the conference has yet to weigh in publicly, and likely won't be swayed by outsiders on a decision that will guide how the chamber operates for the next two years. But an endorsement of a candidate from Trump himself, who will work with the leader going forward, could change the dynamic.",
      "Whether Trump endorses a particular candidate remains to be seen. Thune acknowledged on CNBC last week that Trump can \"exert a considerable amount of influence\" on the leadership race, but he cautioned him against doing so, saying, \"I think my preference would be, and I think it's in his best interest, to stay out of that.\"",
      "\"He's got to work with all of us when it's all said and done,\" Thune said. \"But whatever he decides to do, that's going to be his prerogative, as we know.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump will nominate New York Rep. Elise Stefanik to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, tapping a key House ally to join his administration.",
      "Stefanik, 40, has been one of Trump's most vocal defenders in Congress. She's likely to be confirmed by the new, GOP-led Senate when the president-elect takes office in January, which will set up a race not only to fill Stefanik's seat in the lower chamber, but also to succeed her as chair of the Republican conference.",
      "\"I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,\" Trump said in a statement to CBS News. \"Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter.\"",
      "Here is what to know about the New York Republican.",
      "Stefanik's record in Congress",
      "Stefanik was elected to represent New York's 21st Congressional District in 2014 and at the age of 30, became the youngest woman elected to Congress. Currently in her fifth term, she cruised to reelection in November, defeating Democrat Paula Collins with more than 62% of the vote.",
      "Stefanik serves on the Armed Services, Education and Workforce, and Intelligence Committees. She also is a member of the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, which was created in 2023 when Republicans took control of the House. The weaponization panel was a nod to what many Republicans believed was federal investigators' unfair treatment of Trump.",
      "The New York Republican is the highest-ranking woman in the House, serving in leadership as the GOP conference chair. She replaced former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming in the post after Cheney was ousted for her criticisms of Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Stefanik has been one of Trump's staunchest defenders in the House, having emerged as a crucial ally during his first impeachment proceedings in 2019. She also introduced a nonbinding resolution last year that sought to \"expunge\" both of Trump's impeachments by the House.",
      "During this Congress, Stefanik made headlines for her grilling of university presidents during a hearing about their response to antisemitic incidents following the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks on Israel by Hamas. The presidents of Harvard, Stefanik's alma mater, and the University of Pennsylvania resigned following the hearing.",
      "While Stefanik supported earlier packages sending assistance to Ukraine, she voted against a plan to send $60.8 billion to aid Ukraine in its war against Russia in April.",
      "Stefanik and the 2020 election",
      "The congresswoman was among a group of more than 100 House Republicans who signed onto a friend-of-the-court brief filed with the Supreme Court after the 2020 election in a longshot bid to overturn the election results in four battleground states. She also joined GOP lawmakers in objecting to certifying Pennsylvania's election results.",
      "\"Tens of millions of Americans are concerned that the 2020 election featured unconstitutional overreach by unelected officials and judges, ignoring state election laws,\" Stefanik said during a speech on the House floor after the Capitol attack. \"We can and we should peacefully discuss these concerns.\"",
      "But the congresswoman also condemned the violence of Jan. 6 during the same speech, calling it a \"truly tragic day\" for the country.",
      "\"We all join together in fully condemning the dangerous violence and destruction that occurred today in our nation's Capitol,\" she said. \"Americans will always have the freedom of speech and the Constitutional right to protest, but violence in any form is absolutely unacceptable, it is anti-American, and must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Stefanik would not commit to certifying the results of the election, telling NBC News in January it would depend on whether \"this is a legal and valid election.\"",
      "Stefanik before Congress",
      "Stefanik graduated from Harvard University and worked in the White House for President George W. Bush on the Domestic Policy Council and in the chief of staff's office. She also was an adviser to former House Speaker Paul Ryan during the 2012 presidential campaign, when he was the Republican vice presidential nominee.",

      "\"They're like 150 pounds when they hit the ground.\" Trout said, adding horses are selected by having a good temperament and a spirited demeanor, \"a little extra pep\" that shows on parade routes.",
      "Some of the events the Clydesdales participate in are those put on by Folds of Honor, a nonprofit that offers scholarships to children and spouses of fallen and disabled military service members and first responders. They have been partners for more than 14 years.",

      "\"Nuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\" said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \"For China's leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country's global image as a leading power.\"",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",
      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",
      "Neither China's Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\"The reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\"",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen's complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China's 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \"intended for installation on a large surface warship\" under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project's \"national defense designation\" helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \"national defense-related construction project\" that is classified \"secret.\"",
      "\"Unless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\" researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \"convincing argument.\"",
      "\"From the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\" she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \"carefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\"",
      "\"Given the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\" said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury's research.",
      "China's first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \"ski-jump\" type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn't even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China's People's Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \"soon be announced,\" but so far it has not been.",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once - one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 - something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \"incremental improvements.\"",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \"have taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\"",
      "\"For now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\"",
      "Eventually, however, \"larger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\" Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\"As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\" Childs said.",
      "\"Much will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China's carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy's carriers.\"",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \"with greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\" said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\"These carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military's ability to 'intervene' in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\" Zhao said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \"first-class\" navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country's rejuvenation.",
      "The country's most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \"speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\"",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world's largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China's shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China's rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \"growing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\" the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",
      "And China's \"growing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China's shore,\" the report said.",

      "As delegates from nearly 200 countries gather for a major international summit on addressing the threat of climate change, they're confronting a new era of uncertainty for the United States' climate commitments in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential election victory.",
      "Trump has said that in a second term, he would again exit the Paris Climate Agreement, an accord signed in 2016 aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The U.S. formally withdrew during Trump's first term, but then rejoined under President Biden.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Trump transition office for more information about his plans.",
      "The United States joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, an international treaty, in 1992 and has attended its conferences \u2014 known as COP, for \"Conference of Parties\" \u2014 in many years since, most recently last year's COP28 in Dubai.",
      "Project 2025, the conservative blueprint drawn up by the Heritage Foundation for the next GOP administration \u2014 which the president-elect has endeavored to distance himself from \u2014 calls for the U.S. to withdraw from both the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.",
      "What is COP29?",
      "This year's United Nations Climate Change Conference \u2014 called COP29, since it's the 29th Conference of Parties \u2014 kicks off Monday in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, and runs through Nov. 22.",
      "The annual summit, which is held in a different location every year, brings together world leaders and thousands of other representatives of nations that are party to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Their goal is to take stock of the progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions\u00a0 \u2014 each country sets it own targets and action plan \u2014 and limiting global warming.",
      "So far, the world is falling far short of meeting these climate goals.",
      "Overall,\u00a02023 had the highest greenhouse gas emissions ever recorded, although here are currently 42 countries\u00a0where emissions are decreasing, including the United States, China, Russia and in the European Union.",
      "Without greater reductions over the next few years, the world is on a path to see a temperature increase of more than 3 degrees Celsius, according to an October U.N. report, which warned such an outcome \"would bring debilitating impacts to people, planet and economies.\"",
      "Under the Paris Agreement, countries update their targets for emission cuts (known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs) every five years. The next update is due in February.",
      "Who's going to COP29?",
      "This year, President Biden is sending a delegation that includes John Podesta, the senior presidential adviser for international climate policy, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Ali Zaidi, the White House national climate adviser. Vice President Kamala Harris represented the U.S. at last year's conference.",
      "The gathering in Baku will be smaller than some previous summits for several reasons, including fewer attendance passes and hotel spaces, and concerns over Azerbaijan's human rights record and its oil-production-based economy.",
      "A number of other world leaders have opted not to attend this year, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. California Gov. Gavin Newsom isn't going either, although California often has a strong presence at the conference.",
      "Among the thousands who will attend are delegates from the Taliban government of Afghanistan, the Associated Press reported, citing the country's national environment agency. Though the regime is not internationally recognized, Afghanistan is considered one of the nations most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, with severe drought,\u00a0flooding, and a great need for financial assistance.",
      "Higher attendance is expected at next year's COP30 in Brazil, whose president shown a greater commitment to tackling emissions and climate finance.",
      "What is expected to happen at COP29?",
      "Countries will share updated national climate action plans on how to reduce emissions. The current administration is expected to submit its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) before President Biden leaves office, but whether the commitments will be upheld under the Trump administration seems unlikely.",
      "Attendees will also be discussing climate financing. Developed nations, which are most responsible for climate change, are expected to provide funding to developing nations for climate adaptation and green energy projects. Amnesty International projects that trillions of dollars will be needed to get developing countries up to speed.",
      "What will a Trump presidency mean for U.S. involvement in global climate efforts?",
      "Experts say that withdrawing from major climate agreements has the potential to isolate the U.S. in global climate negotiations, damage its reputation as a leader and encourage other high-emitting nations like China to deprioritize their emissions reductions. Leaving the Paris Agreement would mean the U.S. does not have to report on its emissions each year, and it would have weaker legal responsibilities to provide climate finance to developing countries.",
      "But while exiting these global commitments would be a major setback in the eyes of climate advocates, it wouldn't stop state and local governments, businesses or nonprofits from stepping up.",
      "In the wake of Trump's victory, several climate advocacy organizations released a flurry of statements reiterating their commitment to clean energy investments, carbon emission reduction and environmental protection. States and local governments are also expected to continue investing in initiatives like cap-and-invest programs, carbon neutrality, and infrastructure improvements.",
      "Other countries are also not likely to throw away their climate commitments.",
      "\"I am struck by the last time this happened, even with the shock, not a single other country followed the United States in withdrawing from the agreement,\" said Jonathan Pershing, program director of environment at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and a former special envoy for climate change at the State Department.",
      "Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement would take at least a year to complete, and a future president would have the power to rejoin if they so choose \u2014 just as President Biden did after Trump exited the agreement during his first term.",
      "A withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, on the other hand, could have an even greater long-term impact. Exiting the global treaty would remove the U.S. from the international stage of climate discussions and could hamper the country's ability to participate in negotiations in the future. The U.S. Senate ratified joining the UNFCCC in 1992, which legal experts say could make withdrawal a more complex process.",
      "If the U.S. does withdraw, the rest of the world will continue to negotiate even in its absence. The void left by America will likely be filled by another country, like China, which could negotiate deals that fall in its favor.",
      "\"Leaving the Framework Convention doesn't provide a lot of benefit to a Trump administration,\" said David Waskow, director of International Climate Action at the World Resources Institute, on a call with reporters. \"It actually brings a lot of harm to the U.S. in terms of reputational impacts and the ability to work with other countries on shaping the clean energy economy.\"",

      "the 350 trucks the U.S. government said must be rolling into Gaza to meet the urgent needs of the enclave's 2 million-plus people.",
      "United Nations humanitarian agencies have said in recent days that far from a dramatic increase, even less food and other aid are reaching Palestinian civilians in Gaza due to ongoing Israeli restrictions and evacuation orders and ramped-up offensives in the north and center of the territory, along with chaos created by the lack of any law enforcement presence in the enclave.",

      "In 1977, Morgan Perigo's gold college graduation ring was lost to the ocean while on a trip to Barbados with his wife and two young sons. Perigo, who graduated from McMaster University in Canada in 1965, searched for the ring in vain.",
      "\"One day I took my younger son and waded into the ocean. He was knocked over by a wave, so I reached to grab hold of him. He pulled on my hand and my Mac Alumni ring came off,\" Perigo, now 83, said in an email to the university. \"We searched for it but were unsuccessful.\"",
      "Forty-seven years later, Perigo got his ring back. The surprise reunion unfolded thanks to Alex Davis, a professional freediver who recently discovered the jewelry while using an underwater metal detector. There were three clues inscribed on the ring -- the name of the school, the year 1965 and the initials FMP, Davis told the university.",
      "\"[It's] not surprising the gold has tarnished around the stone setting and the stag emblem is a bit worn down but overall it's in great condition,\" Davis said.",
      "The diver contacted the university and shared photos of the ring.",
      "\"I found a McMaster University signet ring with three initials on the inside,\" he wrote in an email to the school. \"I found it metal detecting in Barbados this morning and suspect it's been lost for some time.\"",
      "Alumni officer Laura Escalante received the email and her search eventually led to Frederick Morgan Perigo, a 1965 mathematics major.",
      "When contacted by the school, Perigo confirmed the ring was indeed the one that slipped off his finger nearly half a century ago.",
      "On the eve of his 83rd birthday, Perigo received a FedEx package sent from Barbados. Inside was his graduation ring.",

    "story": [
      "Tens of thousands of people gathered to ride bikes between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng in central China after a social media post suggested a cheap night-time bike ride to get dumplings went viral. The crowds caused gridlock and prompted bike-sharing companies to lock down their services, CBS News partner network BBC News reported.",
      "The idea for the event was sparked by four college students who took the same roughly 30-mile trip over the summer to get soup dumplings. It appears to have grown out of a trend that's seen young people struggling with China's difficult job market seek out inexpensive travel options.",
      "\"You only have one youth. You have to try a spontaneous trip with your friends,\" one of the four students told local media, according to the BBC.",
      "\"Everyone was beaming with energy and interacting with people around them. It was like back to my college days,\" another participant told the BBC.",
      "But the popularity of the event drew such numbers that it even made it hard for some people to take part, with some reporting they had to get off their bikes and walk through the crowd.",
      "One student said on social media that they'd joined the bike ride but couldn't find a hotel room or taxi in Kaifeng due to the influx.",
      "\"I really regret going. As I sat in a restaurant eating my meal, I heard the owner criticizing college students for having nothing to do... I'm really sorry for affecting the people in Kaifeng,\" the student said, according to the BBC.",

      "The adult male was found on Nov. 1 on a popular tourist beach in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia \u2014 about 2,200 miles north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, according to a statement from the Western Australia state's Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.",

It is believed to be the furthest north \u2014 and thus the furthest from their natural habitat \u2014 that a wild emperor penguin has ever been spotted.",
      "\"The furthest north they go from Antarctica is about 50 degrees south [latitude] from my readings and Ocean Beach is 35 degrees south,\" Cannell told Australia's national broadcaster ABC last week. \"So, a lot further north than what they've ever tracked\u00a0emperor\u00a0penguins from Antarctica before.\"",
      "Could the Arctic be ice-free within a decade?",
      "Could the Arctic be ice-free within a decade?",
      "Cannell said she had no idea why the penguin traveled to Australia's coast. She's advising seabird rehabilitator Carol Biddulph, who's caring for the penguin, spraying him with a chilled water mist to help him cope with his alien climate.",
      "The penguin is 39 inches tall and initially weighed 51 pounds. A healthy male emperor penguin can weigh more than 100 pounds.",
      "The Western Australia biodiversity department said its efforts were focused on rehabilitating the animal. Asked if the penguin could potentially be returned to Antarctica, the department replied that \"options are still being worked through.\"",
      "ABC said last week that the errant animal was first spotted by a local surfer from Denmark, Aaron Fowler, who told the network he and some friends were baffled when they first saw it coming out of the water.",
      "\"It stood up in the waves and just waddled straight up to us, an emperor penguin, he was probably about a meter high, and he was not shy at all,\" Fowler told ABC.",
      "\"There is always a bit of wildlife in the water but never a penguin,\" he said. \"He tried to do like, a slide on his on his belly, thinking it was snow I guess, and just face-planted in the sand and stood up and shook all the sand off.\"",
      "Emperor penguins are among the species directly threatened by the rising temperature of the oceans and seas across the world. According to The World Wildlife Foundation, about three-quarters of the world's breeding colonies of emperor penguins are vulnerable to fluctuations in the annual sea ice cover in the Antarctic, which have become far more erratic due to climate change.",
      "The penguins breed and live on sea ice, but the\u00a0Antarctic Sea ice is disappearing\u00a0as our planet warms up.",
      "\"They show up at the breeding season and the ice isn't there, so they have nowhere to breed,\" Dr. Birgitte McDonald, an ecologist at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, which is funded and administered by San Jose State University, told CBS San Francisco last year.",
      "An analysis by scientists at Cambridge University, published last year in the journal Science News, found that \"ice in one area was melting especially early in the year,\" putting emperor chicks at extreme risk.",

      "Tom Homan, who was ICE director in Trump\u2019s first term, will be the border czar, not a big surprise. Homan will be in charge of the mass deportation program, and when asked if there was a way to avoid separating families, as happened last time, he said sure \u2013 deport them all together.",
      "Stephen Miller, who ran the hard-line immigration policy in the first term, is expected to be named deputy chief of staff \u2013 a promotion, first reported yesterday by CNN, that probably doesn\u2019t convey the clout he\u2019ll have as a trusted member of Trump\u2019s inner circle.",
      "TRUMP WILL LEAVE THE WH WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST APPROVAL RATINGS OF ANY MODERN PRESIDENT, LARA TRUMP PREDICTS",
      "I had been told days ago that Elise Stefanik, a GOP congresswoman from upstate New York, would go into the administration. And yesterday, Trump tapped her to be U.N. ambassador. She has experience in the George W. Bush White House.",
      "Then there are insiders who are the subject of speculation. Howard \u00a0Lutnick, a Wall Street CEO, is being touted by some as a possible Treasury secretary, but has his hands full as a co-chair of the transition.Late yesterday, Trump chose former Long Island congressman Lee Zeldin to run the EPA. He\u2019s a mainstream conservative who has crusaded against excessive environmental regulations and gotten a lifetime score of 14% from the League of Conservation Voters. The choice of Zeldin was first reported by the New York Post, and he told Fox News that the administration will \"roll back regulations\" that are causing businesses to \"struggle\" and are \"forcing\" them to move overseas.",
      "After that, he tapped Florida GOP congressman Mike Waltz as White House national security adviser, which doesn\u2019t require Senate confirmation. As the Wall Street Journal first reported, he\u2019s a China hawk and Ukraine skeptic. \"Stopping Russia before it draws NATO and therefore the U.S. into war is the right thing to do,\" Waltz wrote. \"But the burden cannot continue to be solely on the shoulders of the American people, especially while Western Europe gets a pass.\" (Trump has now reduced by two the House Republicans\u2019 expected small margin.)",
      "Oh, and Politico says some Dems are already jockeying for 2028 (Josh Shapiro and Gavin Newsom) or being talked about (Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear). Already? Can\u2019t we get a break?",
      "So my takeaway is that for all the media chatter about a lack of guardrails, Trump is so far picking serious people with serious experience. (Wiles hasn\u2019t worked in Washington since the Reagan years, but her role is different.) They are, of course, also loyalists who will do his bidding.",

      "And Elon Musk will be in charge of just about everything, and the world\u2019s richest man has deluged X with hundreds of pro-Trump posts (and some high-profile liberals are bailing).",

      "Mike has two iPhones, one for personal use and another for work. In his email to us, he explained his issue: \"When using Siri to call my wife (Terrie) on my personal phone, my WORK phone dials a guy I work with also named Terry. So I\u2019m constantly having to explain my butt dial to him.\"",
      "This leads to awkward explanations and unnecessary \"butt dials.\" The situation highlights a common challenge faced by many users with multiple devices, where voice assistants can become more of a hindrance than a help.",

However, this didn't fully solve the problem, as Siri still struggled to differentiate between similar-sounding names across devices.

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "While Siri's confusion can be frustrating, there are several ways to work around the issue. The most effective solution seems to be using Siri Shortcuts or Voice Control, as these methods create unique commands that are less likely to be misinterpreted across devices. It's worth noting that voice assistant technology is continually improving. In the future, we may see more sophisticated context recognition that can better distinguish between similar names on different devices. Until then, these workarounds should help Mike avoid any more awkward explanations to his colleague Terry!",

    "story": [
      "Chef Robert Irvine of the Robert Irvine Foundation speaks with Fox News Digital about the importance of supporting veterans and first responders this Veterans Day and some unique ways to do so.",
      "Cyberscammers are some of the most heartless people out there. They don\u2019t even spare our military heroes.",
      "Last year, these criminals stole $477 million from veterans, military personnel and their spouses, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). That\u2019s a $63 million jump from 2022, showing that the military community is a big target for scammers. The number of military members who lost money to these attacks went up by 7% to 30,948, per the FTC\u2019s latest data.",
      "These scammers use all kinds of tricks to get veterans to hand over personal info or hard-earned cash, including veterans' benefit scams and IRS scams. I break down five of the most common scams targeting our military heroes and how to stay safe from them.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYSEnter by\u00a0signing up for my free newsletter!",
      "Image of military personnel (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Romance scams",
      "Romance scams have become an increasingly painful reality for veterans, as scammers target them through fake online relationships to exploit their emotions and financial stability. Often, these scammers pose as attractive, understanding individuals on dating apps, social media platforms or even support forums specifically tailored for veterans. They\u2019ll build a relationship over weeks or months, using flattery and fabricated stories to create a strong emotional connection with their target.",
      "Once the scammer believes they\u2019ve gained enough trust, they\u2019ll ask for money, typically by inventing a sudden, urgent situation. It might be a \"medical emergency,\" a supposed travel expense to come to visit or even a claim that they need help with a legal matter. The requests start small but can quickly escalate as the scammer continues to manipulate the victim's emotions.",
      "This continues to be the most common fraud targeting veterans, costing them and their families over $40 million in 2020, according to Aura. Among all romance scam victims, those ages 50-69 were hit the hardest, losing $179.65 million in just the first three quarters of 2022. That figure has almost certainly surged in 2024.",
      "Image of military personnel supporting one another (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "NEARLY 1 MILLION MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES FACE DATA BREACH",
      "Veterans benefit scams",
      "Some scammers pretend to offer help with veterans' benefits. They promise to help increase benefits or expedite claims, but they\u2019re really after personal information or a fee. A scammer might claim you\u2019re eligible for new or additional benefits, contacting you by phone, email or text. When dealing with unsolicited advice, remember that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Phishing scams from fake government agencies",
      "Phishing scams are a social engineering trick where scammers send emails that look like they\u2019re from official places, like the government or your bank. These legit-looking emails act as bait, but the real goal is to grab your banking or credit card info.",
      "Sometimes, these scam emails will ask you to click a link or download an attachment, which can install malware on your device. Scammers are also known to send phishing links through LinkedIn, Facebook or other social media.",
      "One classic example is the IRS scam. Though it targets everyone, military members are prime targets. Scammers pretend to be IRS agents, threatening jail time, fines or other penalties if they don\u2019t get immediate payment. They even spoof IRS caller IDs to make their calls look real.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Rental property scams",
      "Rental property scams are a common way scammers try to exploit people looking for a place to rent. In these scams, fraudsters often post fake listings for apartments or houses on popular rental websites or social media platforms. The listing might look too good to be true, like a beautiful place at an unbelievably low price.",
      "The scammer will usually claim to be out of town or unavailable to meet in person, asking potential renters to send a deposit or rent payment upfront to \"secure\" the property. In some cases, they may even send fake lease agreements or claim that the property is already rented, but they can still \"help\" find a similar place.",
      "BEWARE OF THIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCAM BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU",
      "Car sales and financing scams",
      "Car sales and financing scams targeting veterans are unfortunately common. Scammers know that veterans may have limited experience with certain financial deals, so they exploit that by offering unrealistic car sales or financing options. These scams can take various forms, and the result is often financial loss and stress.",
      "Image of military personnel honoring our troops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways veterans can protect themselves from scams",
      "1) Be cautious with unsolicited offers: Whether it\u2019s a phone call, email or text, if someone claims to offer help with veterans' benefits or promises something too good to be true, don\u2019t take the bait. Verify the legitimacy of any offer directly through official channels like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or trusted veteran organizations.",
      "2) Watch out for emotional manipulation in online relationships: Romance scammers often prey on veterans' emotions. Avoid sharing personal or financial details with people you meet online, especially if the relationship feels rushed or too perfect. If someone asks for money after just a few weeks or months, it\u2019s likely a scam.",
      "3) Verify government communications: Scammers often impersonate government agencies like the IRS or VA. If you get a message that threatens penalties or asks for personal information, don\u2019t respond. Instead, contact the agency directly using official contact details to confirm whether the message is legitimate.",
      "4) Be skeptical of rental or car sale deals that seem too good to be true: If a rental listing or car sale seems too cheap or perfect to be true, it probably is. Always visit the property or dealership in person, and never send money upfront without seeing the product or having a signed agreement.",
      "5) Protect your personal information: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Scammers use phishing emails and fake websites to steal personal and financial information. Ensure your devices have updated security software and be extra cautious when handling sensitive data online.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6)\u00a0Invest in data removal services: Consider using data removal services to protect your personal information from being harvested by scammers. These services can help remove your data from public databases and people-search websites, reducing the risk of identity theft and unwanted solicitations.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers rely on misinformation to trick you. However, by staying informed and being extra careful when navigating the internet, you can stay safe. These bad actors are constantly finding new ways to target veterans, from romance scams to fake government offers. Being cautious, verifying offers and keeping your data secure are the best ways to avoid falling victim to these heartless fraudsters.",

      "Ever feel like navigating the internet is like walking through a digital minefield?",
      "With cybercriminals lurking around every corner, protecting your identity and finances can feel daunting. But what if I told you that a VPN could be your secret weapon?",
      "By masking your IP address and encrypting your data, a VPN makes you nearly invisible to online threats.",
      "Let\u2019s dive into how this powerful tool can safeguard your online activities and keep your financial transactions secure.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "A woman using a VPN on a tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A VPN, or virtual private network, is a service that encrypts your internet connection, ensuring that your online activities remain private and secure. By routing your internet traffic through a secure server, VPNs mask your IP address, making it difficult for hackers and malicious entities to track your online behavior.",
      "A VPN being used on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "CAN YOU BYPASS VPN BLOCKS AND PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY?",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms \u2014 IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from its server network, effectively preventing websites and cybercriminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",

      "Identity theft occurs when someone illegally obtains your personal information to commit fraud. This can lead to unauthorized transactions and damage to your credit status. So, how can a VPN prevent identity theft? By encrypting your internet connection, VPNs protect against data breaches and unauthorized access to personal information, especially on unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi. VPNs also prevent third parties from tracking your online activities, reducing the risk of personal data being harvested for malicious purposes.",

      "Using a VPN to reduce risks in online transactions",
      "Online transactions are vulnerable to interception by cybercriminals looking to steal financial information such as credit card numbers and banking credentials. A VPN can be used as a shield for financial data. VPNs ensure that all data exchanged during online transactions is encrypted, making it nearly impossible for hackers to access sensitive financial information. When using public Wi-Fi networks, which are often targeted by cybercriminals, a VPN provides an additional layer of security by encrypting all data transmissions.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cell phone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Practical tips for using VPNs effectively",
      "1. Choose a reliable VPN provider:\u00a0Opt for reputable VPN services known for strong encryption standards and no-log policies to ensure maximum privacy and security.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "2. Use strong passwords:\u00a0Combine the use of a VPN with strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts to enhance security. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",

      "ChatGPT is an amazing tool, and its developer, OpenAI, keeps adding new features from time to time.",
      "Recently, the company introduced a new memory feature in ChatGPT, which essentially enables it to remember things about you. For example, it can recall your age, gender, philosophical beliefs and pretty much anything else.",
      "These memories are meant to remain private, but a researcher recently demonstrated how ChatGPT's artificial intelligence memory features can be manipulated, raising questions about privacy and security.",

      "What is ChatGPT's Memory feature?",
      "ChatGPT\u2019s memory feature is designed to make the chatbot more personal to you. It remembers information that might be useful for future conversations and tailors responses based on that information, even if you open a different chat. For example, if you mention that you\u2019re vegetarian, the next time you ask for recipes, it will provide only vegetarian options.",

      "You can also train it to remember specific details about you, such as saying, \"Remember that I like to watch classic movies.\" In future interactions, it will tailor recommendations accordingly.

      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "The security vulnerability in ChatGPT",
      "As reported by\u00a0Arstechnica, security researcher Johann Rehberger found that it\u2019s possible to trick the AI into remembering false information through a method called indirect prompt injection. This means the AI can be manipulated into accepting instructions from unreliable sources like emails or blog posts.",
      "For instance, Rehberger demonstrated that he could trick ChatGPT into believing a certain user was 102 years old, lived in a fictional place called the Matrix and thought the Earth was flat. After the AI accepts this made-up information, it will carry it over to all future chats with that user. These false memories could be implanted by using tools like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive to store files, upload images or even browse a site like Bing \u2014 all of which could be manipulated by a hacker.",
      "Rehberger submitted a follow-up report that included a proof of concept, demonstrating how he could exploit the flaw in the ChatGPT app for macOS. He showed that by tricking the AI into opening a web link containing a malicious image, he could make it send everything a user typed and all the AI's responses to a server he controlled. This meant that if an attacker could manipulate the AI in this way, they could monitor all conversations between the user and ChatGPT.",
      "Rehberger's proof-of-concept exploit demonstrated that the vulnerability could be used to exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. The attack isn't possible through the ChatGPT web interface, thanks to an API OpenAI rolled out last year. However, it was still possible through the ChatGPT app for macOS.",
      "When Rehberger privately reported the finding to OpenAI in May, the company took it seriously and mitigated this issue by ensuring that the model doesn\u2019t follow any links generated within its own responses, like those involving memory and similar features.",

      "CYBER SCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "OpenAI\u2019s response",
      "After Rehberger shared his proof of concept, OpenAI engineers took action and released a patch to address this vulnerability. They released a new version of the ChatGPT macOS application (version 1.2024.247) that encrypts conversations and fixes the security flaw.",
      "So, while OpenAI has taken steps to address the immediate security flaw, there are still potential vulnerabilities related to memory manipulation and the need for ongoing vigilance in using AI tools with memory features. The incident underscores the evolving nature of security challenges in AI systems.",
      "The company says, \"It\u2019s important to note that prompt injection in large language models is an area of ongoing research. As new techniques emerge, we address them at the model layer via instruction hierarchy or application-layer defenses like the ones mentioned.\"",
      "How do I disable ChatGPT memory?",
      "If you're not cool with ChatGPT keeping stuff about you or the chance that it could let a bad actor access your data, you can just turn off this feature in the settings.",

      "2. Be cautious about sharing sensitive information:\u00a0Less is more when it comes to personal data. Avoid disclosing sensitive details such as your full name, address, or financial information in conversations with AI.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoid reusing them across different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your ChatGPT and other AI accounts.\u00a0By requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code, you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.",

      "6. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0 In an age where AI is everywhere, protecting your data from cyber threats is more important than ever. Adding strong antivirus software to your devices adds a critical layer of protection.

But, as Johann Rehberger\u2019s findings remind us, there are some real risks involved, especially when it comes to privacy and security. While OpenAI is able to mitigate these issues as they arise, it also shows that we need to keep a close eye on how these features work.

    "story": [
      "SentinelOne's chief security adviser discusses the alarming rise in cyberattacks worldwide on 'Fox News Live.'",
      "Data theft and ransomware attacks against health care and critical third-party providers are still happening at an alarmingly high rate in 2024, which is shaping up to be as severe as last year, the worst on record for health care breaches.",
      "You might remember the\u00a0Ascension ransomware attack from May, one of the most devastating incidents in the health care sector, causing major issues for patients.",

      "Woman working on a computer in a hospital (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Impact of ransomware on health care",
      "Microsoft points out that beyond the financial risk to health care organizations, ransomware attacks can have life-threatening consequences. When health care providers lose access to diagnostic equipment or patient records due to ransomware, patient care is severely disrupted. For example, stroke code activations are nearly double during hospital attacks, with confirmed strokes increasing by 113.6%, and cardiac arrest cases rise by 81% and survival rates drop from 40% to just 4.5%.",
      "Health care facilities near hospitals hit by ransomware attacks also feel the impact, facing a surge in patients needing urgent care that they may not be equipped to handle. As a result, patients often face longer wait times.",
      "What\u2019s more troubling is that these attacks aren\u2019t limited to urban areas. Rural health clinics are also prime targets for cyberattacks. These facilities are particularly vulnerable to ransomware because they often lack the resources to prevent or respond to security incidents. And since these clinics are the only health care option within miles, a successful attack can be devastating for many rural communities.",
      "Mother, daughter and doctor walking in a hospital (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HEALTH CARE RANSOMWARE ATTACK EXPOSES PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION OF OVER 100 MILLION",
      "Why health care is the prime target?",
      "Ransomware attacks on health care have shot up 300% since 2015, making it one of the top 10 most targeted industries in the second quarter of 2024. This rise is mostly because health care organizations store extremely sensitive data, and hackers know there\u2019s big money to be made. With lives on the line, hospitals can\u2019t risk poor patient outcomes if their systems go down or the exposure of patient data if they don\u2019t pay. This reputation for paying ransoms just makes health care an even bigger target.",
      "Some of the blame also falls on health care organizations. They tend to have lower cybersecurity budgets compared to other industries, making it harder to defend against these kinds of attacks. Many facilities don\u2019t have staff dedicated to cybersecurity; some don\u2019t even have a chief information security officer or a security operations center. Instead, cybersecurity often gets lumped in with regular IT duties. Plus, doctors, nurses and other health care staff might not get any cybersecurity training, so they might not even recognize a\u00a0phishing email when they see one.",

      "1. Stay informed: Keep up to date with the latest news from your health care providers and reliable sources to stay aware of any disruptions or data breaches affecting systems and services.",
      "2. Maintain personal health records: Keep copies of your health records on your own devices or printed out, including details like medications, allergies, past surgeries and other relevant health information. This can be crucial if electronic health records become temporarily unavailable.",
      "3. Prepare for medical emergencies: Have a backup plan for emergencies, including knowing nearby alternative health care facilities. Research wait times and accessibility to help avoid delays if your primary facility is impacted.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Practice cybersecurity best practices: Use strong, unique passwords for online accounts and consider a\u00a0password manager to help manage them. Enable two-factor authentication where available to add an extra layer of security.",
      "5. Be vigilant against phishing: Cyberattacks often result in a spike in phishing emails and calls as attackers exploit the situation. Protect yourself by using strong antivirus software on all your devices, which can help block malicious links and detect phishing emails. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Confirm appointments: If you have upcoming appointments or procedures, contact your health care provider to confirm or reschedule if a cyberattack disrupts their normal operations.",
      "7. Monitor patient portals: Keep an eye on patient portals like MyChart for updates on your medical records and communication with health care providers, as these can provide critical information during service disruptions.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The surge in ransomware attacks on the health care industry is troubling and a harsh reminder that criminals don\u2019t care about the lives at risk. They\u2019re just after money. Health care organizations need to take lessons from the past two years, investing heavily in cybersecurity infrastructure and hiring dedicated staff to protect patient data and systems. With stronger defenses in place, the goal is to prevent these situations from reaching the point where paying a ransom is even considered.",

This means that Apple doesn\u2019t share all of its code information, which makes it harder for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities to take over a user\u2019s apps or iPhone.

      "Even though it is more difficult to penetrate the iPhone, it doesn\u2019t mean it is impossible. In fact, some hackers watch for particular vulnerabilities in iOS to launch their attacks. If you see such warnings, it\u2019s best to ignore them and avoid clicking on any links or downloading any suggested software. Below are several key steps you can take to secure your iPhone.",
      "1) Keep your iPhone up to date: Occasionally, Apple releases new iOS updates to address known vulnerabilities. When possible, it is best to\u00a0update the iOS so that your iPhone is safe from known vulnerabilities.",
      "2) Install and run strong antivirus software: An antivirus software actively running on all of your devices can help keep them all safe, including your iPhone. With iPhones, strong antivirus software will prevent you from clicking on any malicious links that may then install malware onto your devices, which can potentially extract personal information from your device. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These can be phishing attempts designed to steal your personal information.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Download apps only from the App Store: Stick to downloading apps from the official Apple App Store. Apps on the App Store are vetted by Apple for security, reducing the risk of downloading malicious software.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Adding an extra layer of security to your Apple ID can help protect your personal information. With\u00a02FA, even if someone gets your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without the second factor.",
      "5) Use strong passwords: Ensure that your passwords are strong and unique for different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them.",
      "6) Monitor app permissions: Regularly check the\u00a0permissions granted to your apps and revoke any that seem unnecessary. This can help prevent apps from accessing more information than they need.",

      "While most iPhone users rest easy knowing that the iOS keeps most common viruses and malware at bay, they are still susceptible to scammers trying to work around the closed code and scaring people into making bad choices that endanger their phones and data. Because Apple never sends out alerts about viruses or malware on your iPhone, it should be the first clue of a scam. Even if it looks official, iPhone users do not get alerts from Apple about viruses or malware. If you do install a good antivirus program, that will be the only program notifying you that there is anything amiss with your iPhone. Understanding these scams can go a long way in keeping you calm and your phone safe.",

I think many are unclear about this.\"",
      "That's a great question, Bill. Now let's dive into this topic and clear up some common misconceptions.",

      "Person checking emails on laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Common misconceptions",
      "Opening emails can instantly infect your device: One common myth is that simply opening an email can automatically infect your device with malware. In reality, modern email systems (such as Gmail, Outlook, etc.) generally prevent this from happening. The real danger comes from interacting with the content inside the email, such as clicking on malicious links or downloading harmful attachments.",
      "Plain text emails are always safe: While emails in plain text format are generally safer than HTML-based emails, they can still pose a risk if they contain malicious links. Phishing attacks can appear in plain text emails, luring you to dangerous websites.",
      "Emails from known contacts are always safe: Even if an email appears to come from someone you know, that doesn\u2019t always mean it's safe. Attackers can spoof email addresses or hack accounts, so always be cautious about unexpected or unusual messages from known contacts, especially those containing links or attachments.",
      "Spam filters catch all malicious emails: Spam filters are highly effective but not perfect. Some sophisticated phishing and malicious emails can bypass these filters and land in your inbox. This is why it\u2019s important to stay vigilant, even with emails that seem to have passed your email service\u2019s security checks.",
      "Previewing emails is always safe: Most modern email clients use a \"preview\" pane for quick reading. While the risk of malware through previews is significantly reduced in up-to-date systems, embedded trackers or other forms of data collection can still occur, confirming your activity to the spammer. Always disable automatic image loading or other active content features in your email client\u2019s settings to minimize exposure.",

      "CONTROL SPAM - HOW TO CREATE A QUICK ALIAS EMAIL ADDRESS",
      "What to watch out for",
      "As mentioned already, generally, simply opening an email is not enough to cause harm. However, there are some important points to consider:",
      "1) Embedded trackers: Some spam or\u00a0phishing emails contain trackers that can notify the sender when the email is opened. This can confirm to the spammer that your email address is active, potentially leading to more spam.",
      "2) Malicious links and attachments: The real danger lies in clicking on links or downloading attachments within the email. These can lead to malicious websites or download malware onto your device.",
      "3) HTML emails: Emails that contain HTML content can sometimes execute scripts when opened. While modern email clients have protections against this, it\u2019s still a potential risk.",
      "4) Phishing attempts: Even if you don\u2019t click on anything,\u00a0phishing emails can be designed to look very convincing and may trick you into providing personal information if you respond.",

      "1) Avoid clicking links or downloading attachments: Never click on links or download files from emails you don\u2019t trust. Scammers often use these tactics to direct you to malicious websites or install malware on your device.

      "2) Use a reputable email client: Choose an email provider that prioritizes security features like spam filtering and\u00a0two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of protection for your account.\u00a0Read more about secure and private email here.",
      "3) Enable email filtering: Turn on spam filters to reduce the number of unsolicited or potentially dangerous emails reaching your inbox. This reduces your exposure to phishing attempts. Most email platforms these days automatically filter out what they assume to be \"junk\" into their own folder. If you notice the amount of spam getting through to your inbox increasing, you may want to consider a\u00a0Spam Filter.\u00a0There are free options for different email providers. For Gmail, try\u00a0Mailwasher. For Outlook and Windows Mail, try\u00a0Spam Bully, which costs an annual fee of $29.95.",
      "4) Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your email client and operating system to stay protected from the latest security vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit.",
      "5) Consider data removal services: Use data removal services to ensure your personal information is less accessible to potential scammers. This reduces your risk of being targeted in the first place.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Former Geary, Oklahoma, Police Department Chief Alicia Ford says the entire department resigned last month after they were refused help from city leaders.",
      "An entire city's leadership has crumbled after the failure of political leaders to meet the police department's needs, its former chief said.",
      "The entire Geary Police Department in Oklahoma \u2014 including Chief Alicia Ford \u2014 resigned on Oct. 31. City Council members Rocky Coleman and Kristy Miller resigned shortly afterward, as FOX 25 Oklahoma City first reported. Mayor Waylan Upchego then resigned, the Watonga Republican reported.",
      "\"The reason that prompted the entire resignation was: it was just a continued failure from the mayor to make change that would affect the department and make it more effective for the community,\" Ford told Fox News Digital. \"It was just an ongoing issue. He consistently refused to keep his word to us, and that was something that we held him to. When you're a mayor, you're [supposed] to lead the city and what's best for the city and the departments within.\"",
      "Ford said she had gone to Upchego and the city council requesting their help to address the overworked and understaffed police department, plus budget cuts that had recently impacted pay and bonuses for officers, on top of some other administrative issues. Nobody stepped up, according to the former police chief.",

      "\"They cut the jail. They cut our dispatch, and that put strain on us. But we found we went to another agency, and they have done excellent and accommodating us with that dispatch,\" Ford explained. \"[The mayor] consistently refused to keep his word when it came to basic needs of equipment and the safety issues within our department. We talked about the budget cuts that caused hardships for these officers and myself that were unnecessary.\"",
      "Hope added that she knows that police departments across the country have dealt with staffing shortages and budget cuts, but her six-person department had recently dwindled to four, with herself doing administrative chief work, one officer stationed at the local high school, and two officers working extremely long shifts doing regular daily police work.",
      "\"Who wants to do that for extremely low pay?\"",
      "\"So that would lead two officers to do basically 24 hours . . . five to seven days a week. That's not realistic,\" she said. \"But honestly, who wants to do that for extremely low pay? I mean, they did it. And honestly, I don't ever really remember these two officers complaining about it.\"",

      "\"At first, it was kind of challenging. It was my first year of being a chief of police. I've taken several roles in law enforcement, but never that type of administrative, high . . . role,\" she explained. \"It was great. . . . Geary, Oklahoma, was an amazing community. They were very accepting of me.\"",
      "The entire Geary Police Department resigned on Oct. 31. (Google Maps)",

      "\"I have tried to be a voice of reason. Unfortunately, I was just one voice. The City Council and administration should not allow personal goals or agendas to affect the city. Decisions should be made only to benefit the city,\" he wrote, adding that council members lacked communication and were frequently left in the dark about agenda items.",
      "\"Transparency is also crucial for communication. I would love to see more communication online, not just in person. For example, the financial reports should be posted for the community to read. I have never shied away from explaining the state of the finances to any citizen who has asked. When people are informed, they are more likely to understand that we have a failing infrastructure and why rate increases must happen. I have repeatedly asked that we be more proactive instead of reactive. We should be prepared for the worst and not hoping for the best.\"",
      "Upchego could not immediately be reached for comment. An interim chief has since taken over the Geary PD, and residents are still able to make 911 calls.",

      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",

      "\"As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\" Childs said.",

      "\"These carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\" Zhao said.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is expected to nominate Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida for secretary of state in his administration in the coming days, according to three sources familiar with the selection process.",
      "Trump could still change his mind, the sources cautioned, noting that the decision wouldn't be finalized until he makes a formal announcement.",
      "The New York Times first reported Trump's plans to select Rubio to be the country's top diplomat.",
      "Foreign policy is one of the few areas in which there is a deep philosophical disagreement among Trump's base.",
      "A main pitch from Trump during the campaign was that he would implement \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, a doctrine that emphasizes less foreign aid, trying to curtail U.S. involvement in current foreign conflicts and avoiding future ones. But there remains a different strain of foreign policy thinking among even prominent Trump supporters.",
      "Even though Rubio is an avowed Trump supporter, the perception is that he was one of the \"less MAGA\" options, a Trump ally told NBC News. It\u2019s a position that requires appealing enough to Trump\u2019s more isolationist political base but also carrying water for the less disruptive brand of foreign policy that those Trump backers generally oppose.",
      "Rubio, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, was seen as a potential pick able to thread the needle of appealing enough to Trump\u2019s political base while not needlessly eroding relationships with foreign allies.",
      "Trump ally said Rubio was someone \u201cTrump\u2019s base could trust.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile Marco is a little more hawkish than the incoming president and vice president, he\u2019s actually not as far away from them as many people might assume at first blush,\u201d another Trump ally said. \u201cHe\u2019s become far more aligned with the president on issues regarding tariffs. He has a similar stand on the China issue, and he even voted against the last round of Ukraine funding.\u201d",
      "A current senior administration official told NBC News that Rubio would be a \u201cserious\u201d and \u201cqualified\u201d choice.\u00a0The person said picking Rubio would be a relief given reporting that Ric Grenell, the highly controversial ambassador to Germany during Trump\u2019s first term, was also in the mix.\u00a0Multiple career diplomats said they were concerned about the State Department\u2019s becoming politicized if Grenell were nominated.",
      "During the last Trump administration, the number of diplomats in senior ranks at the State Department plummeted, at first through voluntary departures soon after his election and later through attrition as the authority of their positions was redirected to political appointees.",
      "Trump had considered Rubio as a running mate before he ultimately chose Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio.",
      "If Rubio becomes secretary of state, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis would get to choose a replacement. That pick would serve until at least 2026, when an election would be held for the seat.",
      "Trump has made a series of other staffing announcements in recent days. On Monday, he announced plans to nominate former Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., as the Environmental Protection Agency's top administrator and to appoint Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., as his national security adviser.",
      "Last week, he said\u00a0Susie Wiles, his campaign manager, would be White House chief of staff. On Sunday, he named immigration hard-liner\u00a0Tom Homan\u00a0as his \u201cborder czar.\u201d"

    "summary": "Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego will be Arizona\u2019s first Latino senator next year, NBC News projects, after defeating Republican Kari Lake in a hard-fought Senate race.",
    "story": [
      "PHOENIX \u2014 Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego will be Arizona\u2019s first Latino senator next year, NBC News projects, after he defeated Republican Kari Lake amid a protracted vote count in one of the key swing states.",
      "Gallego will replace Democratic-turned-independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who retired after one term. It\u2019s the fourth consecutive Senate election Democrats have won in Arizona, which has veered sharply to the middle in the Donald Trump era after years of reliable Republican control. Trump won the state in 2016 and won it again this year by what appears to be his biggest margin in any of the core swing states.",
      "But Joe Biden narrowly carried Arizona in 2020, part of a recent Democratic renaissance in the state.",
      "After the race was called Monday night, Gallego characterized his victory as a dream fulfilled, having grown up impoverished. His mother, Gallego said, dreamed of her kids attending college, a goal which he said he also shared.",
      "\u201cThis is the greatest country in the world, and the only way I could be here is because of this great country,\u201d he said.",
      "A key component of Gallego\u2019s victory was his reinvention as a softer-edged battleground moderate instead of the fiery progressive of his earlier days in politics. Gallego rose through the ranks in Arizona on the edge of his party, stumping alongside progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and joining the Congressional Progressive Caucus in the House.",
      "He largely sidelined the progressive label in his bid for the Senate, though, and among other endorsements this year he got support from one of Arizona\u2019s major police unions, catering to a state that has more registered Republicans than Democrats.",
      "Lake, meanwhile, was unable to sand down the sharp edges of her political persona enough after she lost a MAGA-aligned run for governor in 2022 and refused to acknowledge her defeat. A slice of Republicans and independents were unable to come to terms with her candidacy, and she ran well behind Trump despite her efforts to tie herself to his top-of-the-ticket campaign.",
      "Gallego enjoyed superior fundraising and more outside spending support from his party, consistently outraising Lake throughout the campaign before he left her well behind in the cash race in the final months.",
      "Gallego, a Marine veteran and son of Colombian and Mexican immigrants, fused his identity into his campaign, launching both the \"Veterans for Gallego\" and Juntos Con Gallego\" coalitions throughout the summer. But he kept his message homed on the issues behind those identities, linking them to border security, comprehensive immigration reform and expanded mental health services for veterans.",
      "Gallego focused on his party\u2019s strengths, like reproductive rights, but he also tried to tackle his party\u2019s weaknesses head-on, advertising on issues like border security. Lake tried to tie Gallego to Biden and his administration on a host of issues, but especially border security, a key focus of hers during their lone debate in October.",
      "Lake, who once referred to herself as \u201cTrump in heels,\u201d branded Gallego with a collection of unflattering nicknames, including \u201cswamp rat.\u201d She also went after him personally, bringing up details of his divorce from Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego and trying to pin him to his progressive past.",
      "Gallego noted Monday that there are around 300,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats in Arizona. \u201cI needed to earn the support of all Arizonans,\" he said.",
      "Gallego said he had \"respectful conversations\" with Republican voters, both sides sometimes agreeing and sometimes disagreeing with one another. Regardless, he said, the hope was to \"build some trust.\"",
      "\u201cWhat I have found since ever running for office,\" Gallego said, \"is the best thing you can do is just talk to somebody and treat them like an American, that they deserve the time to talk to you.\u201d"

      "2024 was yet another \u2018change\u2019 election",
      "The 2024 elections represented more than Donald Trump\u2019s White House victory, Republicans\u2019 winning a majority in the Senate, and the GOP being in the driver\u2019s seat to keep the House (though control of that chamber is still up for grabs).",
      "They culminated in the nation\u2019s sixth straight \u201cchange\u201d election, in which either the White House or at least one chamber of Congress switched party control. Just look at this history of recent presidential and midterm election cycles:",

      "In fact, you have to go back to the 2012 cycle for the last \u201cstatus quo\u201d election, where the White House and the two chambers of Congress didn\u2019t change party hands.",
      "There\u2019s also this trend: Control of the White House has now flipped in each of the past three presidential elections (Barack Obama to Trump to Joe Biden and back to Trump).",
      "We haven\u2019t seen that kind of presidential party ping-pong since the 1880s and 1890s, given that the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century were defined by multi-term stretches of either Democratic or Republican presidents.",
      "There are two explanations for all of this change. The first is the simple math: The nation is so divided politically that all it takes is a shift of tens of thousands of votes in key states, or just a few congressional seats, to alter the balance of power.",
      "The second \u2014 and larger \u2014 explanation is the consistent 60% to 70% of voters over the last decade-plus who believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, according to NBC News polling.",
      "With the exceptions of Obama\u2019s elections in 2008 and 2012 and Trump\u2019s first victory in 2016, a supermajority of voters have been dissatisfied with the nation\u2019s direction.",
      "That sentiment was evident in the 2024 election, with a whopping 73% of voters saying they were angry or dissatisfied with the way things were going in the country, the NBC News Exit Poll found. Those voters broke for Trump over Kamala Harris 62% to 36%.",
      "What\u2019s more, a combined 68% of voters in the exit poll described the economy as \u201cnot so good\u201d or \u201cpoor,\u201d despite statistical evidence of a growing economy. Trump won those voters, 70% to 28%.",
      "And Trump was seen as the change agent in the race. According to the exit poll, 28% of voters said bringing \u201cneeded change\u201d was the candidate quality that mattered the most to them (behind \u201chas the ability to lead\u201d and ahead of \u201chas good judgment\u201d and \u201ccares about people like me\u201d).",
      "Trump won those \u201cchange\u201d voters by 50 points, 74% to 24%.",
      "The question headed into the inauguration in January: Can his second term break the cycle of American voters wanting change?",
      "Senate Republican leadership fight becomes a proxy for MAGA influence under Trump",
      "A looming battle among Senate Republicans over who to pick as their next majority leader is turning into an early test of how much power President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMAGA\u201d movement will exert in his second term.",
      "The three-way fight to replace outgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky pits Senate Minority Whip John Thune of South Dakota against Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a former McConnell deputy, and underdog candidate Sen. Rick Scott of Florida.",
      "The battle will gauge the staying power of long-serving senior Republicans grounded in an institutionalist view of the Senate, like Thune and Cornyn, against an emboldened pro-Trump wing looking to smash any vestiges of the old GOP as he returns to power.",
      "Scott\u2019s seeking to claim the latter mantle and told NBC News in an interview Monday that he\u2019ll push \u201cthe Trump agenda\u201d if elected.",
      "\u201cI talk to all my colleagues, and they are clear what they want and know we need to change. They want to be treated as equals, want to be part of a team. They know I have a great relationship with Trump and the speaker of the House, and I am a business guy. And I will get the Trump agenda done,\u201d Scott said.",
      "MAGA influencers online have started an online pressure campaign seeking to sink the current and former McConnell deputies \u2014 and boost Scott \u2014 ahead of a candidate forum Tuesday and an expected closed-door election Wednesday.",
      "But it\u2019s far from clear that the campaign will succeed. The Senate is a famously insular body that is relatively detached from populist fervor, giving members six-year terms and usually operating on seniority. It would be unusual for Scott to leapfrog two colleagues who have served much longer, cultivated deeper relationships and have each paid their dues in pursuit of the job.",
      "Most importantly, the election will be held by secret ballot. Unlike votes on legislation and nominations \u2014 as well as the vote for speaker of the House \u2014 votes for Senate leadership are anonymous. That means relationships will be paramount and the online pro-Trump army won\u2019t know how members voted.",

    "summary": "NBC News hasn't yet called the Senate race in Pennsylvania, where Republican Dave McCormick holds a narrow lead over Democratic Sen. Bob Casey.",
    "story": [
      "Pennsylvania's hotly contested Senate race hangs in the balance nearly a week after Election Day, with Republicans declaring victory and Democrats holding out hope that the remaining batch of outstanding ballots will allow them to close the gap.",
      "NBC News has yet to project a winner in the contest between Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican Dave McCormick, who are separated by just over 40,000 votes with 98% of the expected vote in. An estimated 122,000 ballots have yet to be tallied.",
      "McCormick declared victory Thursday after The Associated Press called the race in his favor. Since then, he and his GOP allies in Washington have ramped up the pressure on Casey to concede, arguing he has no path to victory.",
      "\"The AP called this race a number of days ago because mathematically, there's no path for Sen. Casey to win,\" McCormick said in a Fox News interview Sunday.",
      "\"Ultimately, Sen. Casey's going to have to decide when he's ready to acknowledge that,\" he added.",
      "The Casey campaign has argued the remaining number of expected provisional ballots, particularly from places like Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs, could tilt the scales in its favor.",
      "Maddy McDaniel, a spokesperson for Casey, who is in his third term, said in a statement Saturday that every day counties \"are confirming there are more ballots that need to be counted.\"",
      "\"Pennsylvanians deserve to have their voices heard, and as state officials have made clear, counties across Pennsylvania need more time to tabulate remaining votes,\" she said.",
      "A McCormick victory would further pad Republicans' newfound majority in the Senate, where they will hold at least 52 seats after the election. The size of the majority could play an important role in how much of President-elect Donald Trump's agenda will pass and how many of his nominees will get confirmed.",
      "But even before the new Congress is sworn in next January, the outcome of the Pennsylvania race could have implications for the Senate leadership elections Wednesday.",
      "Three Republicans are vying to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as the party's leader, and senators-elect can participate in the vote.",
      "Without a clear winner yet in Pennsylvania, though, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is waiting to invite either McCormick or Casey to Congress this week for orientation and Wednesday's vote \u2014 a move that has angered Republicans.",
      "Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who is running to be the GOP leader, said on X that \u201cthe idea that Schumer would not allow him to participate in Senate orientation is beyond unacceptable.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., called Schumer's move to hold off on inviting McCormick a \"shameful, election-denying decision\" in a post on X.",
      "A Schumer spokesperson defended the decision, pointing to the number of ballots that have yet to be counted in Pennsylvania.",
      "\"With over 100,000 ballots left to be counted in Pennsylvania, the race has not been decided,\" spokesperson Alex Nguyen said. \"As is custom, we will invite the winner once the votes are counted.\"",
      "Similarly, Arizona Democratic Senate candidate Ruben Gallego was also not invited to the orientation as his race against Republican Kari Lake is too close to call, according to an NBC News projection. He leads by 2 percentage points with 91% of the expected vote in.",
      "Provisional ballots were a contentious issue in Pennsylvania even before Election Day. Pennsylvanians can cast provisional ballots when officials are unclear about their eligibility or there were issues with their returned mail-in ballots. In the days after an election, officials work to determine whether such voters are eligible to cast ballots, and if they are, their votes will be counted.",
      "In the days before Election Day, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to allow Pennsylvania voters who sent mail ballots that were flagged as potentially defective to submit separate provisional in-person ballots, rejecting a lawsuit from Republicans.",
      "McCormick\u2019s campaign filed\u00a0two lawsuits\u00a0Friday challenging an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 provisional ballots in Philadelphia that may have issues, such as missing signatures. Philadelphia is a deep-blue area, and the results in the county so far have leaned heavily in Casey\u2019s favor.",
      "The court dismissed the issue for the time being.",
      "As of Sunday, the Casey campaign was still expressing optimism about overcoming its vote deficit, pointing to the roughly 76% of provisional ballots that favored Democrat John Fetterman over Republican Mehmet Oz in 2022.",
      "\"We don\u2019t believe we need to reach Fetterman\u2019s percent breakdown in order to win. What\u2019s more, there are thousands of ballots that are supportive of Casey that are being cured,\" said a person close to the Casey campaign, referring to the processing of addressing minor mistakes on mail ballots, such as signature issues.",
      "At the presidential level, NBC News projected that Trump won Pennsylvania. He leads Vice President Kamala Harris by about 2 percentage points."

      "Gov. Wes Moore called the occasion not just a great day for Tubman\u2019s home state but for all of the U.S.",
      "\u201cToday, we celebrate a soldier and a person who earned the title of veteran,\u201d Moore said. \u201cToday we celebrate one of the greatest authors of the American story.\u201d",
      "Tubman escaped slavery herself in 1849 and settled in Philadelphia. Intent on helping others achieve freedom, she established the Underground Railroad network and led other enslaved Black women and men to freedom. She then channeled those experiences as a scout, spy and nurse for the Union Army during the Civil War, helping guide 150 Black soldiers on a gunboat raid in South Carolina.",
      "Nobody would have judged Tubman had she chosen to remain in Philadelphia and coordinate abolitionist efforts from there, Moore said.",
      "\u201cShe knew that in order to do the work, that meant that she had to go into the lion\u2019s den,\u201d Moore siad. \u201cShe knew that leadership means you have to be willing to do what you are asking others to do.\u201d",
      "The reading of the official order was followed by a symbolic pinning ceremony with Tubman\u2019s great-great-great-grandniece, Tina Wyatt.",
      "Wyatt hailed her aunt\u2019s legacy of tenacity, generosity and faith and agreed Veterans Day applied to her as much as any other service member.",
      "\u201cAunt Harriet was one of those veterans informally, she gave up any rights that she had obtained for herself to be able to fight for others,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cShe is a selfless person.\u201d",
      "Tubman\u2019s status as an icon of history has only been further elevated within the last few years.

      "The discoveries Monday \u2014 first there were three, then two more \u2014 mean 13 of the Rhesus macaques remain outside the Alpha Genesis Primate Research Center in the town of Yemassee.",
      "In a statement, Yemassee police cited Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard for news of the day's discoveries. \"Additional primates have been successfully recovered today, all appearing to be in good health,\" the police department said.",
      "Over the weekend, police said, 25 of the escaped monkeys had been captured safely.",
      "A group of the monkeys had amassed along the facility's fence line, where many had bedded down for sleep overnight, the police department said Sunday.",
      "Police in the town, about 60 miles west of Charleston, have urged neighbors to be vigilant and keep doors and windows closed and secured.",
      "\"Efforts to safely capture the remaining primates will continue throughout the evening and as long as necessary,\" they said Monday.",
      "They added, \"We cannot stress enough the importance of the public avoiding the area, and under no circumstances should drones be operated near the facility, as they can startle the animals and cause further stress.\"",
      "Westergaard said a caretaker failed to lock two of a new enclosure\u2019s doors during feeding and cleaning, leading to the escape Wednesday.",
      "Alpha Genesis provides \u201cnonhuman primate products and bio-research services,\u201d according to its website. Westergaard has said it used a macaque to aid research into brain disease disorder treatments.",

    "story": [
      "A former body guard for Sean Combs has filed a defamation lawsuit against a woman who in September accused him of physically and sexually assaulting her in 2001.",
      "Joseph Sherman called the allegations in Thalia Graves\u2019 lawsuit \u201cutterly and entirely false,\u201d in documents filed Thursday in federal court in Manhattan. He is also suing Graves\u2019 attorneys, including Gloria Allred. Both women spoke at a news conference to\u00a0discuss the lawsuit in September.\u00a0They declined comment Monday.",
      "Graves alleged in her lawsuit that in 2001 both Combs and Sherman sexually assaulted her at the embattled music mogul\u2019s recording studio in Manhattan after she was summoned to a meeting with Combs to discuss her then-boyfriend\u2019s work performance at the Bad Boy record label.",
      "Combs, she said in the suit, picked her up in an SUV driven by Sherman and offered her a glass of wine that later caused her \u201cto feel lightheaded, dizzy, and physically weak.\u201d",
      "When they arrived at the recording studio, Graves, who was 25 at the time, said she lost consciousness and woke up to her hands tied behind her back with \u201cwhat felt like a plastic grocery bag,\u201d the suit says. She said Sherman had lifted her up from a couch, slammed her down on a table and Combs then raped her, according to her court filing. Sherman also slapped her multiple times and forced her to perform oral sex on him, Graves\u2019 lawsuit said.",
      "She also said in her suit that she learned last year that Combs and Sherman had recorded the alleged encounter and shown it to others, and that both men had contacted her multiple times over the years and warned her to be silent, threatening repercussions, including that she could lose custody of her son if she ever disclosed the alleged assault.",
      "Sherman\u2019s attorney, Darnell Crosland, said in a statement Monday that his client was among \u201cthe thousands of men who have been falsely accused\u201d in the #MeToo movement and who continue to suffer as a result.",
      "\u201cAnd these wrongly accused men aren\u2019t the only victims of false claims, in fact, the thousands of women who are truly sexually assaulted are hurt by these financially motivated claims, because no one hears their cries,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThe defendants in this lawsuit need to be held responsible for their actions and they need to understand that a \u2018cash grab\u2019 based on false claims hurts more people than they can imagine in more ways than they can imagine.\u201d",
      "Sherman is seeking compensatory and punitive damages and a jury trial.",
      "Sherman previously told NBC News that he did not know or rape Graves, that he was employed by Combs from 1998 to 1999 \u2014 years before the alleged assault would have taken place, in 2001, and that he hadn\u2019t seen the rapper in 25 years, all of which his suit also states. Sherman\u2019s filing also says that in 1999 he began working for another record company, a direct competitor of Combs\u2019 and \u201cwas not even allowed into Bad Boy records studios or near Sean Combs after 1999,\u201d so he could not have raped or videotaped Graves.",
      "His suit says that the defendant\u2019s \u201cnegligent conduct\u201d has caused him to suffer harm to his reputation, emotional distress and financial losses, among other things.",
      "Sherman\u2019s lawsuit accuses Graves of seeking a payday. To support that claim, his lawsuit includes a copy of social media messages that he says he received from Graves offering to leave him out of her legal case if he would be a witness against Combs. The screenshots of the messages do not identify the sender. Instead, it says\u00a0that they were sent by \u201cInstagram User\u201d whose account had been blocked by Sherman. He said he responded that he did not know what the person who sent him the messages was talking about.",
      "\u201cI will make sure that the state does not pick up charges or rape charges against you,\u201d one of the messages said, in part, according to screenshots included in Sherman\u2019s suit.",
      "Combs, 55, has been sued by more than 25 people since his former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, an R&B singer known as Cassie, sued him last year, accusing him of years of physical and sexual abuse. He and Ventura settled their suit in a day. Combs denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Combs\u2019 attorneys have vehemently denied the charges in the indictment and allegations in all of the other suits.",
      "He was arrested in September and charged with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. He pleaded not guilty, was denied bail and is detained at a federal jail in Brooklyn. His trial is scheduled to begin in May."

      "No one broke into the establishment. Since the incident, the restaurant\u2019s windows have been boarded up.",
      "\u201cJust the idiocy of people \u2014 that was my first reaction,\u201d said Michael Chelst, the owner of Char Bar. \u201cLike, really? You don\u2019t have anything better to do with your lives than to waste energy and time and people\u2019s money to do what? We\u2019re just a restaurant here.\u201d",

      "Kristallnacht is called the \u201cnight of broken glass\u201d because thousands of Jewish homes, businesses and places of worship were destroyed by German Nazis. Around 90 Jewish people were killed and around 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps.",
      "NBC Washington reached out to D.C. police to see if this is being investigated as a possible hate crime. So far in the investigation, there is no information or evidence that the vandalism was motivated by hate or bias, but that\u2019s something that could potentially change as more information comes to light.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a disappointing thing to hear because it\u2019s pretty clear that it\u2019s a hate crime,\u201d Chelst said. \u201cThere\u2019s seven other places with glass on this street and they didn\u2019t hit any of those.\u201d",
      "Despite the vandalism, customers continued to come to the restaurant, with many saying they decided to dine there as a way to support business.",
      "An online fundraiser was also created to help pay for repairs, which Chelst estimates could cost close to $10,000. He said he\u2019s appreciative of the support.",
      "\u201cWhatever type of hate is out there, we all need to do our part to try and help not let that happen and be supportive of it, and in the meantime, we\u2019re going to go on and we\u2019re going to live our lives and not let people like this change our mission, which is to support our community,\u201d Chelst said."

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:04:03 GMT",
    "summary": "In an interview with Brandi Carlile, Roan and her co-writer/producer, Dan Nigro, share the story behind her debut album, \"Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess.\"",
    "story": [
      "With the \u201cMidwest Princess\u201d still being on the rise, and no end to that ascent being anywhere in sight, the story behind\u00a0Chappell Roan\u2019s star-making debut album got a deeper dive in downtown L.A. Thursday night. For 66 minutes, in front of about 200 fans, celebrity moderator\u00a0Brandi Carlile\u00a0put questions to Roan and her co-writer/producer,\u00a0Dan Nigro, in effect turning the\u00a0Grammy Museum\u00a0into the Pink Pony Classroom.",
      "Subjects raised with Roan and Nigro, just hours before they picked up a slew of Grammy nominations, included why the \"Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\u201d album took five years to come together, what flipped the switch to create the Chappell Roan persona the public knows and loves midway through that process, and what her second album might be like. Spoiler alert: the singer and producer were not giving any spoilers away about Album No. 2. (\u201cWe\u2019re still in the very early stages of making a record, so it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s different,\u201d said Nigro.) But nothing about the first one was off-limits, including some of the relationship difficulties that ended up being explored in song, as the trio plumbed the depths of what already has come to feel like a classic pop record.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not taking it lightly at all to note that there are so many fans of Chappell Roan that would love to get the chance to sit here and ask her anything that they want to know,\u201d said now-veteran Grammy queen Carlile at the outset, establishing fangirl credentials. \u201cAnd, predictably, if you know anything about me, I fell in love with Chappell\u2019s music when my wife showed me a video of \u2018Your Song\u2019 by Elton John.\u201d (The mutual friendships Carlile and Roan share with John came up later in the conversation.) \u201cAnd Chappell\u2019s collision with Dan Nigro is a gift to the whole world and to all of us in this room. \u2026 You two have changed pop music forever.\u201d",
      "Whether or not anyone might count that as premature, Roan does at the very least have the best debut album since, well, Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s (also produced by Nigro, coincidentally or otherwise), with an extra fix of social impact that remains to be fully measured. And when Roan ended the night by mesmerizingly singing two ballads, \u201cPicture You\u201d and \u201cCasual,\u201d with acoustic guitar and violin accompaniment, whatever Recording Academy members were in attendance might\u2019ve been tempted to give the singer\u00a0all\u00a0the Grammys, on the spot, including the ones she\u2019s not up for.",
      "Early in the conversation, Carlile asked about any opposites-attract aspects of the musical relationship between Missourian Roan and New Jerseyite Nigro, who was previously known as Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s go-to guy. Said Roan to Nigro, \u201cIt is so cool to look back and be like, damn, I didn\u2019t know the Cocteau Twins until you literally introduced them to me. And (now) that is one of the tentpoles in who I am.\u201d Meanwhile, she brought some of the rootsier influences in. \u201cWith the country, we just wrote a song called \u2018The Giver\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s country and we played it on \u2018SNL.\u2019\u201d (The audience was aware.) \u201cIt\u2019ll come out, don\u2019t worry. But that was so fun to write that and bring what I knew to the table, because I\u2019m a country girl. So I got to be like, \u2018No, no, no, let me show you some country songs.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was given a lot of homework. Oh my God,\u201d said Nigro.",
      "Noted Carlile, \u201cI\u2019m sitting here looking at this track listing, and I\u2019ve got little cowboy hats written next to the songs where I can sort of hear the country and it actually makes sense to me. I can hear it in the melody of \u2018Red Wine Supernova.\u2019 I can really hear it in the melody of \u2018Picture You.\u2019 I can hear it in all your yelps \u2014 your little Patsy Cline swoops that are a little Cranberries but also a little Patsy. And I can really hear it in my favorite song on the album, which is \u2018Kaleidoscope.\u2019 So country is not farfetched, even without the \u2018SNL\u2019 performance. So tell me: Will you be kicking the O out of country?\u201d",
      "After the audience laughter died down, Roan didn\u2019t take that bait. \u201cI feel like the O\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d she said.",
      "Much of the 66 minutes was devoted to Roan\u2019s artist development, first as it was happening \u2014 or not \u2014 during her previous label deal, during which she only released a preliminary EP, and then as \u201cMidwest Princess\u201d began to take shape over a period of years. Some frustration was expressed over the inability of execs to \u201cget\u201d Roan from the outset, not least of all from Carlile. But for all that, the rising star was also candid in admitting that her persona wasn\u2019t yet in place for anyone to fully grasp until they had found it through some eureka-style songwriting breakthroughs working on this album.",
      "Said Nigro, \u201cOne of our biggest frustrations when we started making music was that we made \u2018California\u2019 and then we made \u2018Pink Pony Club,\u2019 and then Chappell wrote the majority of \u2018Naked in Manhattan\u2019 with an incredible writer named Skyler (Stonestreet), before they brought it to me and I did my thing on it. And the kind of pushback that we were getting in the very beginning was like, \u2018Well, it\u2019s either gotta be the ballads and the slow, organic stuff, or it has to be the pop thing. It can\u2019t be both.\u2019 And I would get so angry \u2014 I\u2019d be like, \u2018It literally has to be both! It can\u2019t be anything else. If you don\u2019t do both, you\u2019re missing the essence of her.\u2019\u201d",
      "But, Roan said, \u201cI had no money (coming in). I had an EP that did not do well. \u2026 I had toured, but I\u2019d never done a headline show. I had no numbers backing me up. And also, \u2018Pink Pony Club\u2019 released in April 2020. It was the worst time for a club anthem to come out. \u2026 It took like a lot of writing mostly bad songs on my part to get to all these good songs. \u2026 I feel like also we had time, because we didn\u2019t have a label on my ass to get something out. It\u2019s not like I was a cash cow that everyone was waiting for me to put new music out so they could make another buck.\u201d",
      "\u201cYeah,\u201d said Carlile, \u201cbut how did (people in the industry) hear \u2018California\u2019 and \u2018Pink Pony Club\u2019 and not go, \u2018Holy s--t\u2019?\u201d",
      "\u201cI hadn\u2019t built the world yet (around them),\u201d Roan said. Even with \u201cPink Pony Club\u201d out as a single years ago, she described herself as \u201can artist that has no other songs that sound like that, and doesn\u2019t even have an aesthetic at that time that matched it at all, really. I did a complete 180. (Previously) I wore only black on stage and everything was serious. And the second that I took myself not seriously is when things started working. \u2026 The world only exists in context of the other songs, and I didn\u2019t have the other songs yet. That\u2019s why people didn\u2019t understand why \u2018Pink Pony Club\u2019 and \u2018California\u2019 belonged in the same world.\u201d",
      "Roan spoke repeatedly to how she had been afraid first of all to write more light-hearted fare, and then, most of all, to put it into the world. \u201cI walked away from \u2018My Kink Is Karma.\u2019 I literally remember walking out of the studio being like, \u2018That\u00a0is stupid.\u2019\u201d",
      "And not just that one. \u201cGenuinely,\u201d she admitted, \u201cI was stressing when \u2018Hot to Go\u2019 came out because I was like, \u2018People are not going to take me seriously as a writer.\u2019 Because that song \u2014 there\u2019s not a song of depth. I think that it\u2019s hard for me to let go of what other artists or writers\u201d might have as a reaction to anything with an edge of silliness. \u201cI think I\u2019m better at it now. But it took practice. Like \u2018Femininnomenon\u2019 \u2014 I just remember kicking myself, being like, \u2018That is such a stupid song.\u2019\u201d But, Roan noted, \u201cI think that\u2019s actually where where camp comes in, and that is where the magic of drag inserts herself. And because it works in tandem with not taking yourself seriously, writing songs that are about just literally having fun.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd, like, laughing at sex,\u201d Carlile interjected. \u201cWhich is really great. Nobody does that, ever, in songs, and you do it throughout this record, so many times \u2014 I\u2019m just cracking up and identifying with so much of it.\u201d",
      "Carlile also spoke in the broader sense of how Roan and Nigro \u201cgo into the studio and you create fantastical sounds, melody lines and moments in a song\u201d that \u201cdon\u2019t stare at their shoes. They\u2019re meant to be played for other people and draw people into big joy-bomb moments.\u201d",
      "Said Roan, \u201cI think that we write from the pyramid, and the top of the pyramid is the live show. So that is why I wanted to write my version of \u2018YMCA\u2019 [with \u2018Hot to Go\u2019], because I wanted something I could look out to the audience with and do with them. I mean, it makes me think of actually why I even really switched so hardcore into pop, because I watched the Queen movie with Rami Malek [\u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019]. ... That scene whenever they\u2019re performing at Live Aid and they\u2019re performing \u2018Radio Gaga\u2019\u201d and doing the audience participation part \u2014 \u201cthat changed my career!\u201d she exulted. \u201cIt pivoted, and I was like:\u00a0I will do whatever it takes.\u201d",
      "\u201cDid it make you feel so proud to be queer, too, and understand how much joy is in that?\u201d Carlile asked.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t there yet,\u201d Roan responded.",
      "\u201cYou weren\u2019t there yet? Wow. Maybe it was subconscious,\u201d Carlile said.",
      "\u201cI think it was like, I just would do anything to feel that way in a crowd. I just thought to myself: How do I do something where I can look out and have everyone do the same thing. \u2026 It\u2019s so powerful to all do the same movement, and I don\u2019t know why that is.\u201d",
      "Said Nigro, \u201cThe seed was planted when we made \u2018Femininnomenon,\u2019 with the bridge\u2019s call and response \u2014 and then you started playing shows, and then you were seeing how people were responding to that. I think that was also a moment of \u2018Oh, we can push it even further.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cI just wanted to write songs that would be amazing live, to interact with the audience,\u201d Roan said. \u201cAnd I genuinely think that\u2019s why this project has caught fire this year, because it\u2019s been my year of performing live, at every festival, (or) on so many tours. We\u2019ve done 83 shows this year. It\u2019s no joke \u2014 I think that\u2019s why. These songs were never meant to only be hidden on an album somewhere. \u2026\u00a0Then you\u2019re not just trying to write like a good song so that other songwriters think you are a good songwriter. It\u2019s like, no, I\u2019m writing \u2018Hot to Go\u2019 because I want every person in the crowd to be able to do something with me, and with each other.\u201d",
      "\u201cMan, when you put it that way, the amount of time I have spent agonizing over the seriousness of the songs just feels a bit like wasted life,\u201d Carlile quipped.",
      "Another light-bulb part of this realization was recounted by Roan when she was asked whether she ever felt jealous watching other performers rock a crowd. She told of going out on tour opening for the U.K. singer Declan McKenna, on a 43-show road trip in a van in the dog days of January and February. \u201cThe biggest cap room on the tour was 400,\u201d she pointed out. But the venues weren\u2019t too small to literally kick up some celebratory spirit. \u201cFor his final song, he would throw balloons out into the audience, and I would sit there, seething, because I was like:\u00a0Why the f--k did I not write music that I can throw balloons out to people?\u00a0At this time, I had no answers. I was mad at myself for not writing music (like that), because at that time, it was the first EP, which was really dark and just not who I am anymore. But that is exactly what you\u2019re talking about \u2014oh my God, I so badly wish that I could throw balloons out in the audience. Which is such a specific dream! And it was a domino effect.\u201d",
      "Said Carlile: \u201cI think everyone thinks now that you, like, invented balloons.\u201d",
      "On a more serious note, Carlile admitted some envy of her own, albeit on the songwriting front. \u201cLet me tell you what makes me feel unsettled and jealous and a little bit upset with you when I don\u2019t really want to be,\u201d Carlile said \u2014 \u201cit is that I didn\u2019t write the song \u2018Kaleidoscope.\u2019 When I hear that song, it\u2019s upsetting to me, as one of those jealousy moments that I have. When those come along, I really pay attention. It helps me create something great. I think it\u2019s really different in a way that it stands out in some unique way I haven\u2019t figured out yet on this album.\u201d",
      "\u201cWell,\u201d said Nigro, \u201cwhat you\u2019re noticing is there\u2019s actually the one song on the record that\u2019s 100% written by Chappell.\u201d But he noted that there were some sonic wrinkles that make \u201cKaleidoscope\u201d stand out as richly colored. He rented out a \u201cfancy\u201d studio with a grand piano in it that, Roan noted, Adele was said to have recorded \u201cSomeone Like You\u201d on. \u201cCould not nail it. I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d And so, added Nigro, \u201cI literally bought a piano for the song, so I have two pianos in my house/studio now. \u2026 I used to have one piano and Chappell was like, \u2018This piano\u2019s not right for this song.\u2019 And so I went to the store and I literally played about 40 pianos because I was like, \u2018What piano has the feel for \u201cKaleidoscope\u201d?\u2019\u201d He took his MIDI track, added a Roan vocal with the microphone placed in the vicinity of 5-10 feet away, and then \u201cI tried to play to her vocal as delicate as possible. \u2026 We still didn\u2019t like it, and then we forgot about it for three months.\u201d Coming back to it after a break, they realized they\u2019d nailed it.",
      "Carlile was not done obsessing, for inspiration: \u201cOn my next album, I\u2019m gonna have a song as good as \u2018Kaleidoscope.\u2019 You watch.\u201d",
      "Roan began to go deeper into what inspired her to write the track in the first place. \u201cI think that\u2019s the last song I\u2019ve finished by myself. It took everything from me to write that. And I think that it\u2019s specific to queer relationships, because it is about falling in love with a friend, which (happens) a lot of times in queer relationships where you are friends and maybe you\u2019re not out yet, but then you realize that one of you is like \u2018Oh, wait, I\u00a0am\u00a0gay.\u2019 It\u2019s so complicated. And that song is exactly about falling in love with your friend. And then I literally wrote it right after I told my friend that I was in love with her. And she was like, \u2018Can you just give me a day to think about this?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cWas she surprised?\u201d Carlile wondered.",
      "\u201cYeah. But we were best friends. \u2026 We hung out every day. But she said, \u2018Can you just give me a day?\u2019 And in that day, that\u2019s when I wrote that. Because I was like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna f---ing kill myself. I need to f---ing get something together or I\u2019m going to explode.\u2019 And I just wrote that \u2014 and then the next day she was like, \u2018I do not feel the same.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd when you fell in love with her, did you know you were gay prior to that? Or did it slowly happen over the course of your friendship?\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it confirmed it,\u201d Roan said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why it was so heavy. Because I had been calling myself (that in the casual manner of) \u2018Oh yes, I\u2019m queer \u2014 whatever.\u2019 But that was like, no, no, no \u2014 I was\u00a0in love\u00a0with her. And it was so amazing. Even though she didn\u2019t feel the same back. I\u2019m so grateful that that happened because, one, for the first time I got confirmation that \u2018Yeah, I am not a fraud for saying I\u2019m gay.\u2019 And two, what an incredible person to fall in love with for the first time \u2014 your best friend, that you think is awesome and hilarious. It was just perfect, looking back.\u201d",
      "\u201cA really human coming-out realization story,\u201d said Carlile. \u201cI think that\u2019s absolutely gorgeous. Did you guys stay friends? Did it get weird?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had to take a year off. \u2026 And in the song, it\u2019s like: Whatever you decide, I will understand, and it\u2019ll just take time to go back to being friends. And it f---ing did. Like, it took a year and a half of not speaking. But I think that\u2019s the beautiful relationships of women, that you can grow up, and that\u2019s why lesbians are living with their exes, with their new girlfriend\u2026\u201d",
      "Carlile lit up, having her own story to relate about this \u2014\u00a0noting that she has an ex who is \u201cmy best friend, and my kids call Aunt Kim.\u201d",
      "Even Roan seemed a little shocked by this: \u201cYour ex-girlfriend is your kids\u2019 Aunt Kim?\u201d",
      "\u201cShe literally lives next door to me because I helped her move into the house. And furthermore, when we go anywhere, she sits in the passenger seat next to me \u2014 I drive and my wife sits in the back seat and f---ing laughs at how we fight. Everywhere we go, we just fight, fight, fight, fight.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnly lesbians\u2026,\u201d said Roan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very lesbian. You know, you could take that \u2018Kaleidoscope\u2019 song, and you could put it in reverse and write about how women that fall in love with each other sometimes do slowly become friends again over time. It\u2019s this really crazy cycle, you know? And sometimes that\u2019s not what happens. But anyway, I just think it\u2019s absolutely brilliant and so far beyond your years.\u201d",
      "The discussion turned to one of a couple of songs on the album that Nigro and Roan said they spent years trying to get right, \u201cRed Wine Supernova.\u201d The producer said that finding a way to \u201cget the camp in it\u201d was a process. \u201cI think in our minds when we made it, the chorus was always a downtempo chorus \u2014 and we kept on going back to the song and being like, \u2018It just gets boring.\u2019 \u2026 Thank God she was really persistent: \u2018This song\u00a0is\u00a0on the album; you just gotta figure it out, Dan.\u2019 I was just like, fine. \u2026 And literally I think I did (the chorus arrangement) as a joke. We were in the studio thinking, what the f--k are we gonna do with this song?\u201d Then, as a lark, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll just go double time on the drums and it\u2019ll be yee-haw\u201d \u2014 and we did it like that and (realized), \u2018That\u2019s actually kind of cool.\u2019 \u2026 So we finally cracked the code to the chorus. And then when we wrote the bridge to \u2018Red Wine,\u2019 I was like, \u2018We are lyrical geniuses. We are the greatest geniuses in the world.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cWell, it\u2019s part of the shedding of taking yourself seriously,\u201d Carlile said to Nigro. \u201cWhy are you so well versed in camp? I mean, that\u2019s a great suit, but you don\u2019t strike me as gay.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery day I was like, to Chappell, \u2018Can we just write \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d today?\u2019 Chappell was like, \u2018No, we\u2019re not writing \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d\u2019\u201d Anyway, he explained, \u201cI used to sit in my room and listen to Queen\u2019s \u2018Greatest Hits\u2019 record every day.\u201d Carlile concurred, singing a snippet of \u201cBicycle Race,\u201d her sole vocal contribution of the night.",
      "A near-miss for the final album title was revealed. Speaking of \u201cFemininomenon,\u201d Roan admitted, \u201cI can\u2019t even say \u2018femininity\u2019 anymore\u201d \u2014 and she stumbled over the word to prove it. \u201cI can only say \u2018femininomenon.\u2019\u201d Though she resisted the mirth of the title at first, \u201cIt was another classic case of \u2018Let go, Kayleigh. Just let go \u2014 just say \u2018femininomenon.\u2019 \u2026 I was gonna call the album \u2018Femininomenon,\u2019 but I was too annoyed that people couldn\u2019t say it.\u201d",
      "One of the evening\u2019s final submitted audience questions was whether Roan has a song \u201cyou once felt deeply connected to but don\u2019t relate to as much now,\u201d which led to a thoughtful reply Roan was able to connect to more than just one tune.",

It\u2019s almost to me like it\u2019s me riling them up to see like how upset can we get together right now \u2014 not me baring my soul in the writing anymore. What it has become is he audience is actually singing, and I\u2019m just reflecting it back to them. And I think that it\u2019s the same for \u2018My Kink Is Karma.\u2019 That\u2019s another one that is just so fun now,\u201d where, she indicated, it used to carry too much baggage from its real-life origins.",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s me anymore. I actually think it\u2019s everyone else that creates the rest of the world. Like, we have created a puzzle piece \u2014 a\u00a0big\u00a0puzzle piece \u2014 but what it has become is not because of us. It has become what it has become because it\u2019s a story that wanted to be told, so she told herself. It wasn\u2019t me, if that makes any sense.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk spent\u00a0$44 billion\u00a0to buy Twitter, now known as X, and\u00a0at least $130 million\u00a0to help get\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0elected president.",
      "It\u2019s a combination that\u2019s paid off handsomely. Since Trump\u2019s victory last week, Musk is about $70 billion richer on paper.",
      "Most of Musk\u2019s wealth is wrapped up in his holdings of\u00a0Tesla, and in the four trading days since the election, the electric vehicle maker\u2019s stock has soared by about 39%. That\u2019s lifted the company\u2019s market cap well past $1 trillion.",
      "Musk\u2019s net worth has swelled to $320 billion, according to\u00a0Forbes, putting him close to $90 billion ahead of\u00a0Oracle\u00a0founder\u00a0Larry Ellison, the world\u2019s second-richest person. Ellison, a close friend of Musk\u2019s and a former Tesla board member, is a longtime Republican donor who\u2019s seen his own Trump bump, with Oracle\u2019s 10% increase lifting his net worth by about $20 billion.",
      "For Musk, getting Trump back into the White House became another full-time job. He\u00a0funded a\u00a0swing-state operation\u00a0to register right-leaning voters, and he led rallies as a surrogate for his favored candidate. He started $1 million giveaways to registered voters who signed one of his America PAC petitions, and he faced\u00a0a lawsuit\u00a0over running an illegal lottery in Pennsylvania.",
      "Musk also used X,\u00a0the social media platform he acquired in 2022, to constantly tout his support for Trump while frequently spreading misinformation about his opponent,\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as topics like immigration and voter fraud.",
      "Now, Musk is trying to make sure he cashes in on his investments.",
      "After the election last week, Musk briefly joined Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,\u00a0NBC News\u00a0reported. Other outlets, including\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0and ABC, have reported that Musk has been weighing in on staffing decisions for the next administration, and he\u2019s spent a lot of time since the election at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Brendan Carr, who is likely to be Trump\u2019s choice to run the Federal Communications Commission, is seen as a longstanding Musk ally.",
      "Musk ran a\u00a0straw poll\u00a0on X for his 200-million plus followers asking who should be Senate majority leader, and he\u2019s personally\u00a0endorsed\u00a0Florida Republican Sen.\u00a0Rick Scott\u00a0for the position. He also reposted a comment from Trump about the need for the majority leader to support recess appointments for his nominees so they don\u2019t need Senate confirmation.",
      "\u201cWithout recess appointments, it will take two years or more to confirm the new administration!\u201d\u00a0Musk wrote.",
      "Benefiting Musk\u2019s empire",
      "Musk has long sought to reduce regulatory authority so that he can eliminate impediments to his sprawling business empire, which includes Tesla and X, as well as defense contractor SpaceX, artificial intelligence startup xAI, brain computer interface company Neuralink and tunneling venture Boring Co.",
      "Those companies are currently embroiled in a range of probes and lawsuits from federal agencies pertaining to matters including alleged securities law violations, workplace safety, labor and civil rights violations, violations of federal environmental laws, consumer fraud and vehicle safety defects.",
      "Given the executive branch\u2019s outsized control over federal regulatory bodies, Musk can look forward to regulators and intelligence agencies winding down some or all of the 19 known ongoing federal investigations and lawsuits against Tesla, SpaceX and X.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got the golden touch right now and has the ear,\u201d said Deepwater Asset Management\u2019s Gene Munster, a longtime Tesla bull, in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday.",
      "In addition to Tesla, SpaceX is also a \u201cclear beneficiary\u201d of a Trump presidency, Munster said. He added that xAI could be rewarded as the new administration considers AI regulations.",

The products were also being sold at\u00a0Kohl\u2019s\u00a0and DSW, among other retailers. Some sites were still taking action on the listings throughout the day Monday.",

      "\u201cLike any business, mistakes can and do happen in the toy business,\u201d said James Zahn, editor in chief of The Toy Book. \u201cThis was likely an innocent oversight that made it through the normal processes. Most consumers \u2014 kids and adults alike \u2014 will never read the fine print on a package, and at the end of the day, the packaging is designed to end up in the trash.

      "Six years later, \u201cYellowstone\u201d is set to air its final episodes, but without the show's favorite land magnate, John Dutton, played by Kevin Costner. His last appearance on the show was during the first part of Season 5, which\u00a0was released in 2022.",

      "What happens in first episode of Season 5, Part 2 of 'Yellowstone'?",
      "The first episode finds viewers in the middle of major drama as emergency services and caution tape surround John Dutton\u2019s mansion. As Beth Dutton (Kelly Reilly) runs to the house with Kayce Dutton (Luke Grimes) not far behind her, it becomes imminently clear that something is wrong with their father.",
      "As the siblings enter the home, viewers find that Governor Dutton has supposedly died by suicide. Beth immediately accuses Jamie (Wes Bentley) of having killed their father. While this opener is a jarring way to start off the second half of Season 5 \u2014 the episode quickly pivots to another scene.",
      "Viewers are now taken back to six weeks prior to Dutton's death as they follow Beth, Kayce, and their families in the days leading up to the tragedy. During the episode, time jumps back and forth between what led up to John Dutton\u2019s death and its aftermath.",

      "As the first episode unravels, viewers quickly learn that John Dutton's death was not in fact suicide. Rather, it was a murder-for-hire scheme set forth by Sarah Atwood (Dawn Olivieri) who was in cahoots with Jamie Dutton. Sarah, a lawyer who has been an issue for John in previous episodes, says that she and Jamie agreed on the plan, but Jamie says he wasn't on board.",
      "While  John Dutton\u2019s death is made clear in the first few minutes of the episode \u2014 viewers soon learn that his presence still looms in the minds of the Dutton family.",

      "What are the 'Yellowstone' spinoffs?",
      "The expanding \"Yellowstone\" universe already has two popular spinoffs within the franchise and more on the way. The various shows travel throughout time, chronicling the same family over the course of hundreds of years.",
      "This prequel was packed with star power, including country stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, and actor Sam Elliot. The show traveled back in time to chronicle how the Dutton family first settled in Montana.",

      "\u201cShe said when you recorded the song, you said, \u2018Still gotta make a decision\u2019 instead of, \u2018We gotta make a decision.\u2019 And that was the first time I knew that I know that I recorded the song incorrectly,\u201d he said, prompting fans to laugh.",

      "Combs\u2019 account is complicated by a re-listen of Chapman\u2019s original tune, released in 1988. Chapman\u2019s recording of the song goes, \u201cYou gotta make a decision,\u201d according to Genius \u2014 not \u201cwe,\u201d as Combs said.",

      "\"When it comes to the performance it\u2019s still hard to process how amazing it really was to be up there on that stage.

      "The actor said that since Everard's murder, she's been more vocal in her personal life, with both women and men.",
      "\"So it was just sort of something that naturally came up on the show, but it's been really interesting to see what the response has been like,\" she said. \"It's just sort of gone everywhere.",
      "\"I think people have needed something like this, on a platform like that, to go, OK, we can talk about it now, and just to talk about that,\" she continued. \"And of course, it's not something that guys would have to think about, but I think it's really important for us, for all of our little young girls that are growing up, that we go like, 'This is the this is the mentality that a woman has to have, and that a young girl has to have every day ever.'\"",

Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry said a further six people were wounded. There was no immediate Israeli comment.",
      "In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people, according to the director of a nearby hospital that received the bodies.",

Hundreds of people have been killed since the offensive began on Oct. 6, and tens of thousands of people have fled to nearby Gaza City.",
      "On Friday, experts from a panel that monitors food security said\u00a0famine is imminent in the north\u00a0or may already be happening.

      "The officials did not say whether Hamas had been given a deadline, how its diplomats had responded to the warning to leave, or where they would go.",
      "The move is one of multiple indications that the Biden administration is intensifying efforts to achieve a Gaza cease-fire and hostage deal before leaving office.",

      "Meanwhile, Qatari leaders face the prospect of a hawkish Trump presidency and more powerful Republican lawmakers with little tolerance for rounds of unsuccessful talks or patience with the kingdom\u2019s role as a go-between for militants.",
      "The U.S. request to oust Hamas came partly because of the death of American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin and it coincided with the unsealing of indictments for Hamas leaders, including Khaled Meshal, who is known to be living in Qatar, according to the U.S. official.",
      "The official said the U.S. is still trying to secure the release of hostages \u2014 and that the administration believes that expelling Hamas from Doha will place more pressure on the organization.",
      "\u201cQatar has played an invaluable role in helping to mediate a hostage deal and was instrumental in securing the release of nearly 200 hostages last year,\u201d the senior U.S. official said. \u201cHowever, following Hamas\u2019 repeated refusal to release even a small number of hostages, including most recently during meetings in Cairo, their continued presence in Doha is no longer viable or acceptable.\u201d",
      "About 250 people were taken hostage during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack, which killed around 1,200. Of those, about 100 remain in captivity, with a third believed to be dead. More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the ensuing war, and Israeli forces have destroyed much of the blockaded enclave.",
      "The two diplomats told NBC News that Hamas was also asked to leave Qatar and relocate to Turkey in April. But after officials there failed to compel Hamas to agree to a hostage deal, that decision was quickly reversed, they said.",

      "Qatar has housed Hamas\u2019 political bureau for over 20 years, and before the war, provided the group with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual assistance, with the knowledge and cooperation of the Israeli government, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank.",

      "The Summary",
      "A new report describes the dire state of Earth\u2019s snow and ice.Among other findings, it warns that several key climate tipping points appear more likely to be reached than previously thought.They include ice melt that could cause severe sea-level rise and the collapse of a crucial ocean current that governs how heat cycles in the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "A new report describes the dire state of Earth\u2019s snow and ice.",
      "Among other findings, it warns that several key climate tipping points appear more likely to be reached than previously thought.",
      "They include ice melt that could cause severe sea-level rise and the collapse of a crucial ocean current that governs how heat cycles in the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Venezuela lost its final glacier this year. The Greenland Ice Sheet is losing, on average, 30 million tons of ice per hour. Ice loss from the Thwaites Glacier, also known as the \u201cDoomsday\u201d glacier because its collapse could precipitate rapid Antarctic ice loss,\u00a0may be unstoppable.",
      "These are just a few of the stark findings from more than 50 leading snow and ice scientists, which are detailed in a new report from the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative.",
      "The report summarizes the state of snow and ice in 2024: In short, experts agree, it\u2019s been a horrible year for the frozen parts of Earth, an expected result of global warming. What\u2019s more, top cryosphere scientists are growing increasingly worried that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a key ocean current that governs how heat cycles in the Atlantic Ocean, is on a path toward collapse.",
      "A rapid halt to the current would cause rapid cooling in the North Atlantic, warming in the Southern Hemisphere and extreme changes in precipitation. If that happens, the new report suggests, northern Europe could cool by about 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit in a decade.",
      "The report highlights a shift in consensus: Scientists once thought tipping points \u2014 like the collapse of AMOC \u2014 were distant or remote possibilities. Now, some of those thresholds are appearing more likely to be crossed, and with less runway to turn the situation around.",
      "\u201cThe latest science is not telling us that things are any different to what we knew before, necessarily, but it\u2019s telling us with more confidence and more certainty that these things are more likely to happen,\u201d said Helen Findlay, an author of the report and a professor and biological oceanographer at Plymouth Marine Laboratory in England. \u201cThe longer we record these things, and the longer we\u2019re able to observe them and start to understand and monitor them, there\u2019s more certainty in the system and we start to really understand how these tipping points are working.\u201d",
      "Last month, 44 leading scientists wrote in an open letter to leaders of Nordic countries that the collapse of AMOC remained \u201chighly uncertain\u201d but that evidence in favor of such a collapse was mounting, and risks have been underestimated. Dramatic changes to the AMOC, they warned, would \u201clikely lead to unprecedented extreme weather\u201d and \u201cpotentially threaten the viability of agriculture in northwestern Europe.\u201d",
      "The new report similarly draws attention to the risk of AMOC collapse.",
      "Additionally, it projects that roughly two-thirds of glacier ice in the European Alps will be lost by 2050 if global greenhouse gas emissions keep their pace. Already, an estimated 10 million people are at risk of glacial outburst floods in Iceland, Alaska and Asia \u2014 a phenomenon already occurring as meltwater collapses ice dams and rapidly floods downstream. If high emissions continue, the report adds, models suggest that sea level could rise by roughly 10 feet in the 2100s, imperiling parts of many coastal cities.",
      "The report was released as world leaders gathered Monday in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, for the United Nations\u2019 COP29 climate conference.",
      "\u201cTiming is everything,\u201d said Julie Brigham-Grette, a geosciences professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and an author of the new report.",
      "She said the group hopes to rattle world leaders to attention: \u201cThe sense of urgency couldn\u2019t be higher. We\u2019ve been talking about urgency for a decade. It almost starts to feel like a useless word. What\u2019s more than \u2018urgent?\u2019 \u2018Catastrophic?\u2019 We\u2019ve run out of ways to describe it.\u201d",
      "To date, the report says, world governments are falling short on the pledges they made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of the Paris Agreement.",
      "Even if they were on track, those commitments\u00a0are insufficient to reach global climate goals, the authors say. On paper, the world\u2019s pledges would limit the rise in global temperatures to about 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 degrees Fahrenheit) this century. That\u2019s well short of the goal to cap warming at 1.5 degrees C.",
      "Global temperatures are currently on pace to rise more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit), on average.",
      "\u201cI feel quite frustrated,\u201d Findlay said. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand how they\u2019re missing the severity of the issue.\u201d",
      "In Baku on Monday, world leaders did agree to new rules for a global market to trade carbon credits. In a news release, COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev, who has been Azerbaijan\u2019s minister of ecology and natural resources since 2018, said the agreement was a \u201cgame-changing\u201d tool to direct climate financing to the developing world.",
      "But he also acknowledged, in a speech to delegates, that the world is \u201con a road to ruin\u201d under current climate policies.",
      "That warning and the new report both come amid fears the U.S. will backslide on its climate commitments and pull out of the Paris Agreement after Donald Trump takes office in January. Trump wants to remove the U.S. from the international treaty, and he began that process during his first presidential administration. President Joe Biden reversed the move in 2021.",
      "Peter Neff, a glaciologist and climate scientist at the University of Minnesota who was not involved in the new report, said its authors clearly communicated the scientific consensus.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing surprising for a glaciologist. Across the board, there\u2019s not good news with respect to ice on Earth. It\u2019s all, for the most part, going in one direction,\u201d Neff said.",
      "But he added that he still found the report\u2019s findings to be staggering: \u201cThese documents can hit you like a ton of bricks, and that\u2019s intentional.\u201d"

      "Stefanik, 40, has been a staunch defender of Israel in its response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks and has been outspoken over the last year about antisemitism on college campuses. A day before last week's election, Stefanik reiterated her call for the defunding of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency\u00a0for Palestine Refugees in the Near East because she alleges it has been infiltrated by Hamas.",
      "Israel has accused staff members of the organization of participating in the Oct. 7 terror attacks, prompting it to fire at least 10 people. Israel's parliament voted in late October to ban the organization's operations.",
      "Stefanik has served as the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference since May 2021, after then-Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., was ousted over her vocal criticism of Trump. Stefanik has served in the House since 2015 and represents New York's 21st Congressional District, which covers upstate New York, bordering Vermont and Canada.",
      "Any appointments by Trump that lead to vacancies in the House could prove problematic for House Republicans. While they could maintain control of the lower chamber, an election outcome that NBC News has not yet called, their margin will be slim, and they struggled throughout the last Congress to maintain effective control of the body with few votes to spare."

      "FIFA must halt the process to pick Saudi Arabia as hosts of the 2034 World Cup unless major human rights reforms are announced before the vote next month, Amnesty International and the Sport & Rights Alliance (SRA) have said.",
      "Votes are due to be held at the FIFA Congress next month to approve the 2030 and 2034 World Cups, though each has only a single bid. A combined bid of Morocco, Spain and Portugal is the sole bid for\u00a02030,\u00a0while Saudi Arabia is the lone bidder for 2034.",
      "Amnesty and the SRA said they had evaluated the human rights strategies proposed by the bidding countries and concluded in a new report that neither bid adequately outlined how they would meet the human rights standards required by FIFA.",
      "They said the risks were far greater in Saudi Arabia and hosting the tournament in the Gulf country would lead to \u201csevere and widespread\u201d human rights violations.",
      "\u201cThere will be a real and predictable human cost to awarding the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia without obtaining credible guarantees of reform,\u201d Steve Cockburn, Amnesty\u2019s head of labor rights and sport, said in a statement.",

      "Discrimination concerns",
      "The World Cup hosts are set to be officially appointed at the FIFA Congress and Saudi Arabia\u2019s bid is almost certain to succeed due to the absence of any other expressions of interest before FIFA\u2019s deadline late last year.",
      "A major cause for concern has been whether LGBTQ people will be discriminated against in the Kingdom, where people can be sentenced to death if it is proved that they have engaged in same-sex sexual acts.",

      "\u201cWe are committed to cultivating a competition environment free of discrimination, and striving to eradicate discrimination based on protected characteristics,\u201d Saudi Arabia said in its World Cup bid book.",

      "Cockburn said Saudi Arabia would need a vast number of migrant workers to deliver its World Cup ambitions in a country which has neither established a minimum wage for non-citizens nor introduced measures to prevent worker deaths.",
      "The issue is similar to the worker deaths in neighboring Qatar, which hosted the 2022 World Cup and built new stadiums with the help of migrant labor.",
      "Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper reported that at least 6,500 migrant workers \u2014 many of them working on World Cup projects \u2014 had died in Qatar after it won the right to stage the event, but the\u00a0number was disputed\u00a0by the Gulf nation.",
      "\u201cWe are dedicated to upholding our commitments concerning forced labour, child labour, non-discrimination and occupational safety and health. We will strive to ensure our partners uphold these standards,\u201d Saudi Arabia said in its bid book.",

      "The push to retake territory comes as the two sides exchanged an intense wave of drone attacks that Ukraine said killed eight people, and after President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, which could upend the U.S. approach to the war. The Kremlin on Monday denied that Trump had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Ukraine and its allies have warned a counteroffensive in Kursk was likely for weeks, and said that thousands of North Korean troops were among the force assembled by the Kremlin in Kursk.",
      "\u201cThe importance of this operational area cannot be underestimated given the number of enemy troops concentrated there,\u201d Syrskyi said in a post on Telegram, adding that soldiers were engaged in combat in the area. \"If it were not for the steadfastness of our soldiers, these tens of thousands of enemies from the best Russian assault units would have stormed our positions\" elsewhere on the front lines, he said.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed in September that Ukraine had seized roughly 500 square miles of Russian territory, but its offensive has stalled in recent months after Putin promised to \"squeeze\" Ukrainian troops out of the country.",
      "Russia had initially struggled to respond, and there seemed to be limited resources devoted to driving back the first invasion of Russian land since World War II.",

    "summary": "As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to enter the White House, the president of South Korea and other world leaders are planning to use golf to woo him.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 As foreign governments prepare to deal with a second Trump administration, at least one key U.S. ally is hoping to make headway on the fairway.",
      "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol \u201cgot out his golf clubs for the first time in eight years and resumed his golf practice\u201d as he gets ready to meet President-elect Donald Trump in person, his office told NBC News on Monday.",
      "Trump famously loves the sport and has golf properties in Florida, New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere. For lawmakers, businesspeople and occasionally world leaders, getting out on the links has been an important way to get close to him.",
      "Yoon, whose approval rating hit a record low 17% last week, also convened an emergency economic and security meeting over the weekend in response to Trump\u2019s election victory, his office said in a text briefing Sunday. South Korean officials are especially concerned about Trump\u2019s vow to impose tariffs of 20% on all U.S. imports, as well as other demands he could place on the country and the overtures he could make toward its rival, North Korea.",
      "Yoon told reporters last week that he had spent about 10 minutes on the phone with Trump after his election victory and that the two leaders \u201cagreed that we should meet in person soon.\u201d",
      "He appears to be following the playbook of Japan\u2019s late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said David Boling, director of Japan and Asian trade at New York-based consulting firm Eurasia Group.",
      "Abe, who was assassinated in 2022, had a close personal relationship with Trump and played golf with him at least five times both in the United States and Japan, sometimes raising ethical concerns. He also gifted Trump with a set of gold-plated golf clubs during a November 2016 visit to Trump Tower in New York, shortly after he was first elected president.",
      "Abe \u201cwas extraordinarily skillful in dealing with Trump,\u201d including through golf, Boling said in a briefing last week after the U.S. election.",
      "\u201cHe flattered Trump, he gave him gold golf clubs, he nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe thing that was remarkable to me about Abe is he was willing to sacrifice his own rather large ego to make space and room for Trump\u2019s big ego.\u201d",
      "Yoon \u2014 who stole the show at a White House state dinner last year with his rendition of his favorite song, \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d \u2014 \u201ccould be the Abe of a Trump 2.0 administration, at least from East Asia,\u201d Jeremy Chan, a senior analyst for China and Northeast Asia at Eurasia Group, said in the same briefing.",
      "In addition to being \u201cconstitutionally cut from a very similar cloth\u201d  as Trump, he said, Yoon is \u201cremarkably pro-American\u201d and \u201cvery fluent\u201d in English.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve heard Yoon doesn\u2019t really play much golf, but he\u2019s also a man of many talents,\u201d Chan said. \u201cAnd so he could potentially learn how to swing a club or two, if that\u2019s going to get him on the green with President Trump.\u201d",
      "He may also be able to leverage Trump\u2019s interest in golfers such as Lydia Ko of New Zealand, who was born in Seoul. When Ko won gold in the women\u2019s individual golf event at the Paris Olympics in August, Trump congratulated her and described her as \u201cmost impressive\u201d in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, adding that he had met her at his Trump Turnberry golf resort in Scotland.",
      "Compared with Abe, it may be tougher going for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who was voted by lawmakers to remain in office Monday despite his long-governing party\u2019s dismal showing in parliamentary elections last month.",
      "\u201cIshiba does not play golf the best that I can tell,\u201d Boling said.",
      "South Korea had outwardly projected calm before the U.S. presidential election, saying the U.S.-South Korea relationship would remain \u201crock-solid\u201d no matter who won.",
      "\u201cBut a lot of that sort of sanguine attitude, I think, belies real disquiet beneath the surface\u201d in terms of security and the economy, Chan said.",
      "Like Japan, South Korea is likely to face higher U.S. tariffs \u201cor straight up just extraordinary demands for South Korea to purchase more U.S. goods to reduce the trade imbalance,\u201d which has roughly doubled since the end of Trump\u2019s first term, Chan said.",
      "South Korean Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok said last week that the government would work to minimize any adverse impact on local companies from changing U.S. trade policies.",
      "There are also concerns about the future of the U.S.-South Korea security alliance, after Trump accused Seoul in his first term of not paying enough for the 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea. Not long after Trump left office, South Korea reached an agreement with his successor, President Joe Biden, to increase its contribution by almost 14%, the biggest increase in almost two decades.",
      "Last month, the U.S. and South Korea agreed on a new five-year cost-sharing plan for the U.S. troops.",
      "\u201cThey did this to get ahead of potential Trump victory and to prevent another round of extortionary negotiations,\u201d Chan said.",
      "But it\u2019s possible Trump will ask South Korea to pay still more, Chan said, and that he will threaten to reduce the U.S. military presence in South Korea or the two countries\u2019 joint military exercises if it doesn\u2019t.",
      "Maintaining a strong security alliance with the U.S. is especially important for South Korea given the growing hostility from nuclear-armed North Korea. While Yoon takes a hard line on his northern neighbor, Trump is widely expected to resume the in-person summits he held during his first term with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "But North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs have made big advances since Trump left office, Chan said, and his new administration may now be prepared to accept a freeze in Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions rather than its complete denuclearization, essentially accepting North Korea as a nuclear state.",
      "That in turn could lead South Korea and even Japan to consider whether they need nuclear weapons of their own.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a few steps between here and there, but that\u2019s top of mind for policymakers,\u201d Chan said.",
      "Stella Kim reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong."

      "Dutch police said they took away more than 300 pro-Palestinian protesters who ignored a ban on demonstrations in Amsterdam on Sunday and detained 50 more following clashes involving Israeli soccer fans last week.",
      "Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the capital\u2019s Dam Square, chanting \u201cFree Palestine\u201d and \u201cAmsterdam says no to genocide,\u201d in reference to the Gaza war.",
      "Israel denies allegations of genocide in its more than year-long offensive against Palestinian militant group Hamas.",
      "After a local court ratified the city council\u2019s ban, police moved in, instructing protesters to leave and rounding up more than 100 of them.",
      "Police said they removed 340 people from the protest area by putting them on buses and dropping them off on the outskirts of the city. Another 50 protesters were detained by the police.",
      "One protester was taken to an ambulance due to bleeding.",
      "The ban, which authorities extended for another four days until Thursday, has been in place since Friday after attacks on Israeli soccer supporters following a match between visiting Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax Amsterdam.",
      "At least five people were injured in assaults that Dutch authorities and foreign leaders including Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced as antisemitic.",
      "In the Netherlands, protest organizers said in a message on Instagram that they were outraged by the \u201cframing\u201d of unrest around the match as antisemitic and called the protest ban draconian.",
      "\u201cWe refuse to let the charge of antisemitism be weaponized to suppress Palestinian resistance,\u201d they said. Video showed Maccabi fans chanting anti-Arab slogans and pulling down Palestinian flags in the lead-up to the game.",
      "On Sunday, Israel urged its citizens to avoid attending cultural and sports events abroad involving Israelis over the coming week. A statement issued by Netanyahu\u2019s office said Israel had intelligence that pro-Palestinian groups abroad intended to harm Israelis in cities in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and others.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office meanwhile announced that he would attend the France-Israel match at Stade de France on Thursday to promote \u201cfraternity and solidarity\u201d following the events in Amsterdam.",
      "Four people remain detained on suspicion of violent acts, including two minors. Another 40 people have been fined for public disturbance and 10 for offences including vandalism.",
      "Police said that hit-and-run actions were held against visiting Israeli fans Thursday night, adding that the fans on their part burned a Palestinian flag and used sticks, pipes and rocks in clashes with opponents.",
      "Police said on Sunday that they would also investigate footage showing Maccabi fans using violence, though a police spokesperson could not immediately confirm which footage exactly would be part of the investigation.",
      "Local police chief Olivier Dutilh told the court on Sunday that the protest ban was still needed as antisemitic incidents were continuing, including people being pushed out of taxis and told to show their passports on Saturday night.",
      "The Netherlands has seen a rise in anti-Semitic incidents since the Gaza war began in October last year.",
      "More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza, according to health officials there, and much of the enclave has been destroyed. Israel launched its campaign after Hamas militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took more than 250 hostages in a cross-border attack, according to Israel."

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 11:04:34 GMT",
    "summary": "Lawmakers in Japan voted Monday to retain Shigeru Ishiba as prime minister despite his long-governing party\u2019s poor showing in parliamentary elections last month.",
    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 Lawmakers in Japan voted Monday to retain the embattled Shigeru Ishiba as prime minister despite his long-governing party\u2019s dismal showing in parliamentary elections last month.",
      "Ishiba, 67, became prime minister of the key U.S. ally on Oct. 1 shortly after he won the leadership race for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II. But his future was in question after the party suffered its worst election defeat in more than a decade, losing support from voters angry about corruption scandals and the rising cost of living.",
      "That left the LDP without a parliamentary majority, but Ishiba was nonetheless able to keep his hold on power and will rule with a minority government. He must now face the challenges of a weakened and unpopular governing party, as well as a possible shift in approach from Washington after the victory of President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Ishiba, a straight-talking former defense minister, got 221 votes to 160 for Yoshihiko Noda, leader of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party. Other candidates got a total of 84 votes.",
      "Speaking at a news conference Monday night, Ishiba said it was \u201cimpossible to predict\u201d what Trump will do once in office.",
      "\u201cWe will carefully analyze in detail what he has said during the election and ask ourselves what is in the national interest of Japan,\u201d he said.",
      "Earlier, at an annual troop review on Saturday at a Japanese military base outside Tokyo, Ishiba vowed to strengthen his country\u2019s diplomatic efforts and defense capabilities as Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, faces \u201cthe most severe and complicated security environment in the postwar era.\u201d",
      "He cited violations of Japanese airspace in August and September by China and Russia, as well as a Chinese aircraft carrier\u2019s entering Japan\u2019s contiguous waters for the first time in September. Japan and other countries are also concerned by accelerated weapons testing in nuclear-armed North Korea, which this year signed a mutual defense pact with Russia.",
      "The U.S.-Japan alliance is the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of Japan\u2019s diplomacy and security, said Ishiba, who said he and Trump had pledged to \u201cwork together to take the Japan-U.S. alliance to new heights\u201d in a phone call after Trump\u2019s election victory last week.",
      "Japan has a lot to worry about from a second Trump presidency, Koichi Nakano, a visiting scholar at Harvard\u2019s Weatherhead Program on U.S.-Japan Relations, said in an interview before the U.S. election last week.",
      "Many Japanese officials assume that Trump is going to be \u201cmore straightforwardly anti-China\u201d and that Japan will be \u201csomehow miraculously left off the hook,\u201d he said. But they are \u201cmisreading\u201d Trump, he said, despite his famous friendship with the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.",
      "Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs should be taken \u201cvery seriously,\u201d Nakano said, considering Japan\u2019s widening trade surplus with the U.S., its top export destination. They could have \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences for a country already wrestling with rising costs and a \u201cvery low\u201d currency, he said.",
      "Japan can also expect pressure from the Trump administration to spend more on defense, David Boling, director of Japan and Asian trade at the New York-based consulting firm Eurasia Group, said at a briefing after the U.S. election last week.",
      "Though Japan has already pledged to double\u00a0defense spending\u00a0to\u00a02% of gross domestic product by\u00a02027, \u201cthat\u2019s probably not going to be enough to satisfy Trump,\u201d Boling said.",
      "There is also strong U.S. opposition to Japanese company Nippon Steel\u2019s $14.9 billion bid to acquire Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel. President Joe Biden, Trump and his Democratic rival in the presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris, had all come out against the deal.",
      "\u201cIt looks pretty dead,\u201d Boling said. The only way to revive it, he said, is for Nippon Steel to reach an agreement with United Steelworkers, a Pittsburgh-based union that has vocally opposed the takeover.",
      "Takahiro Mori, vice chairman of Nippon Steel, told reporters last week that the company hoped to close the deal by the end of the year, before Trump takes office.",
      "Much will come down to interpersonal relations. While Abe was \u201cextraordinarily skillful\u201d in dealing with Trump, Ishiba has a different personality, Boling said.",
      "Ishiba \u201cis more of a deep thinker type,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s known to be something of a defense intellectual, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to work that well with Trump.\u201d",
      "Japan does have a few things working in its favor, Boling said. It is unlikely to be at the top of Trump\u2019s \u201ctrade target list,\u201d and it would do well to remind him that it is the top source of foreign direct investment in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. also \u201crecognizes that Japan has really become an indispensable ally in the Indo-Pacific region and that for Washington to have an effective policy on economic policy or national security policy directed towards China, it really needs Japan on its team,\u201d Boling said.",
      "Still, Trump\u2019s second term could be challenging for Japan, where many see him as a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d in terms of security and the global economy, Jeff Kingston, professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, said in an interview before the U.S. election.",
      "\u201cCertainly, I don\u2019t think Trump would be a welcome partner. They saw how disastrous it was last time around,\u201d Kingston said. \u201cBut Japan will adjust because the security environment is quite risky and they need the American security umbrella.\u201d",
      "Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo and Jennifer Jett and Peter Guo from Hong Kong."

      "British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has pulled his new children\u2019s book from shelves, saying he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the offense he caused following criticism that the book stereotyped Indigenous Australians.",
      "The book, \u201cBilly and the Epic Escape,\u201d was first published in May and drew outrage in Australia, where Indigenous leaders described it as trivializing the community's history and diversity, as well as perpetuating harmful stereotypes against them.",
      "The book\u2019s publisher, Penguin Random House U.K., said it was withdrawing the book from sale.",
      "\u201cIt is clear that our publishing standards fell short on this occasion, and we must learn from that and take decisive action,\u201d the publisher said Monday in an emailed statement.",
      "Oliver, who was in Australia promoting his cookbook \u201cSimply Jamie,\u201d also apologized in a statement.",
      "\u201cI am devastated to have caused offense and apologize wholeheartedly,\u201d he said. \"It was never my intention to misinterpret this deeply painful issue. Together with my publishers we have decided to withdraw the book from sale.\"",
      "The book narrates the abduction by the book\u2019s main villain of a First Nations Indigenous character named Ruby, who is living in foster care.",
      "But the description is in such a way that puts the blame on her family, which the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Corporation (NATSIEC) said \"dangerously trivializes\u00a0the ongoing trauma associated with Australia\u2019s violent history of child removal.\"",
      "For decades, successive Australian governments forcibly removed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families as part of an assimilation policy.",
      "\u201cThe implication that First Nations families are easily swayed by money and neglect the safety of their children perpetuates a racist stereotype that\u00a0has been used to justify child removals for over a century,\u201d NATSIEC said in an emailed statement Monday.",
      "The book also equates First Nations beliefs and spirituality with magic, NATSIEC said, calling it a long-held stereotype.",
      "\u201cThis trivialization\u00a0is both culturally insensitive and harmful,\" it said. The book also included errors made by mixing different Indigenous languages, which NATSIEC said reinforced the \"harmful stereotype that Indigenous peoples are a homogenous group.\"",
      "The organization said it welcomed the withdrawal of the book, \"which was developed without any consultation with First Nations\u00a0people or organizations.\""

He is headed next to Washington \u2014 where the\u00a0U.S. government is confronting China\u2019s rise\u00a0\u2014 and then to Peru and Brazil for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and Group of 20 summits.",
