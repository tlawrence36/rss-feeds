      "In John Irving\u2019s next book, the author is returning to St_ Cloud\u2019s, Maine, and to the orphanage made famous in his acclaimed \u201cThe Cider House Rules.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- In John Irving's next book, the author is returning to St. Cloud's, Maine, and to the orphanage made famous in his acclaimed \u201cThe Cider House Rules.\u201d",
      "Simon & Schuster announced Thursday that Irving's \u201cQueen Esther\u201d will be published Nov. 4. His novel will bring back Dr. Wilbur Larch from \u201cThe Cider House Rules,\u201d but otherwise features a new set of characters. According to Simon & Schuster, \u201cQueen Esther\u201d will span much of the 20th century as it follows the life of Esther Nacht, a Viennese Jew born in 1905, abandoned at age 4 and taken in as a teen by a New England family.",
      "Irving ends the story in Jerusalem, in 1981.",
      "\u201cThe construction of this novel long predates the events of Oct. 7, and everything that\u2019s happened in Israel since those terrorist attacks and the hostage-taking,\" Irving said in a statement. \u201cWith hindsight, it\u2019s easy to say that what I saw and heard in Israel in the early 1980s serves as a precursor to what has developed since that time, but this is what historical fiction is for.\u201d",
      "Irving, 82, is also known for such acclaimed works as \u201cThe Hotel New Hampshire,\u201d \u201cThe World According to Garp\u201d and \u201cA Prayer for Owen Meany.\u201d He published \u201cThe Cider House Rules\u201d in 1985 and won an Oscar for writing the screenplay for the 1999 movie adaptation. Michael Caine, who played Dr. Larch, received an Oscar for best supporting actor.",
      "\u201cOne of the deepest pleasures of reading John Irving comes from discovering the turns in his story along with his characters, so I will give away no plot details, other than to say this: In \u2018Queen Esther,\u2019 John Irving literally takes readers where he\u2019s never taken them before,\" Irving's editor, Simon and Schuster CEO Jonathan Karp, said in a statement.",
      "\"The fact that John is still breaking new artistic ground in his 80s and doing so with such audacious and impeccably crafted storytelling, is yet another reason why he is one of the world\u2019s greatest writers.\u201d"

      "A Texas crisis communications specialist has sued Blake Lively for defamation after the actor pulled him into her legal fight with co-star and director Justin Baldoni over their film, \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "Jed Wallace and his company, Street Relations, filed the $7 million lawsuit in federal court in Texas on Tuesday. It says he had nothing to do with any campaign to harm Lively's reputation as she alleged in a court filing.",
      "Wallace is not among the defendants in Lively's federal lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company and publicists, in which she alleges sexual and other harassment during the production and a campaign to smear her after it. The crisis specialist is named in the court papers and the New York Times story published on the day the series of legal battles began in December when Lively filed a complaint.",
      "Lively\u2019s lawyers said in a statement that Wallace\u2019s lawsuit \u201cis not just a publicity stunt.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is transparent retaliation in response to allegations contained within a sexual harassment and retaliation complaint that Ms. Lively filed with the California Civil Rights Department,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile this lawsuit will be dismissed, we are pleased that Mr. Wallace has finally emerged from the shadows, and that he too will be held accountable in federal court.\u201d",
      "In a filing last week in Hays County, Texas, that seeks a deposition from Wallace, Lively alleges he was used by publicists working with Baldoni to weaponize \u201ca digital army around the country, including in New York and Los Angeles, to create, seed, manipulate, and advance disparaging content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums.\u201d",
      "Wallace's lawsuit says neither he nor his company \"had anything to do with the alleged sexual harassment, retaliation, failure to investigate or aiding and abetting the alleged harassment or alleged retaliation.\u201d",
      "It says the actor's Texas filing \u201cconceded that Lively has no facts supporting the allegations she made against Wallace and Street,\" which is why she now seeks to investigate the extent of his conduct.",
      "After Lively sued Baldoni, he filed his own federal lawsuit against her and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d star Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "Baldoni had already sued The New York Times for libel, and his former publicist filed a lawsuit taking Lively's side.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel that begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a domestic total of nearly $150 million.

      "A mother is called to her child\u2019s school for an urgent meeting with his teachers in the Norwegian film \u201cArmand,\" which opens in theaters Friday",
      "A mother is called to her child\u2019s school for an urgent meeting with his teachers in the Norwegian film \u201cArmand,\u201d a riff on a claustrophobic courtroom thriller set in a primary school classroom.",
      "The film, which won the best first feature prize at Cannes last year, dolls out bits and pieces of information slowly and purposefully, building not a solid set of answers but a web of complications and ambiguities. It is a strange and fascinating experience that may be a bit frustratingly inconclusive but is never not compelling.",
      "Even the inciting incident is withheld from the audience for a time. We\u2019re thrown into a conversation between a junior teacher, Sunna (Thea Lambrechts Vaulen), an administrator type Asja (Vera Veljovic) and the school\u2019s principal, Jarle (\u00d8ysten R\u00f8ger). Asja and Jarle are entrusting Sunna to lead this conversation (though they'll have to join eventually). None of them are even quite sure what exactly happened, whether it was innocent or malicious, or what to do if they can get to the bottom of it. Jarle advises Sunna to treat it soberly, whatever that\u2019s supposed to mean.",
      "Not even Armand\u2019s mother Elisabeth ( \"The Worst Person in the World's\"Renate Reinsve ) gets a hint as to what the meeting is about. She\u2019s a famous actress whose career has come to a halt and who has been tabloid fodder recently. Elisabeth arrives at the classroom first and wants answers, understandably. Sunna must awkwardly delay providing any information until the other parents arrive to Elisabeth\u2019s increasing frustration. Sunna even stammers something reassuring that it\u2019s not too bad. She is, of course, lying because the accusation is serious and beyond any of their depths. Armand\u2019s classmate Jon has apparently told his parents, Sarah (Ellen Dorrit Petersen) and Anders (Endre Hellestve) that Armand has sexually abused and threatened him. They\u2019re both 6-year-olds.",
      "These aren\u2019t just schoolmates either but cousins and that\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg of trauma and shared history in this room, haunted by characters who aren\u2019t even present: Armand and his dead father, Thomas. Neither of the kids is shown through the duration, and there\u2019s much debate over whether 6-year-olds would use the language that the adults allege.",
      "\u201cArmand\u201d is the directorial debut of writer-director Halfdan Ullmann T\u00f8ndel, who has the daunting pressure of being a descendant of cinema royalty. As if making a movie isn\u2019t hard enough on its own, T\u00f8ndel\u2019s grandparents are Liv Ullmann and Ingmar Bergman. And perhaps because of that \u201cArmand\u201d pushes away from the conventions of a straightforward, talky character study and plays with our perception of reality. Twice Elisabeth breaks into choreographed dance \u2014 both expressions of her emotional state and one of which takes a particularly sinister turn.",
      "One might expect that two unexpected dance sequences would be the standouts in a film, but \u201cArmand\u201d has another. It\u2019s also a release, in a way. After a while of back and forth, debates, reveals and non-starters, Elisabeth breaks out into uncontrollable laughter. This stretches on for several agonizing, astonishingly impressive minutes of mad exertion. It\u2019s really quite an acting marvel from Reinsve \u2014 and everyone else in the scene watching it all play out. A broken fire alarm that goes off sporadically helps keep the atmosphere nice and tense, as does Asja\u2019s random nose bleeds that always seem to derail pivotal decision-making moments.",
      "\u201cArmand\u201d engages in some stylish wheel spinning, broken up by some revelations and cathartic moments. And yet every time you feel like you have a grasp on the situation, something else arises that seems to undermine it. Ambiguity and inconclusiveness can be satisfying in cinematic storytelling, but this feels a little too underbaked either way. Ideas are introduced and abandoned, or not fleshed out well. Why, exactly, has she stopped working, for instance. And what\u2019s the story behind Anders\u2019 and Elisabeth\u2019s relationship? It\u2019s a promising debut from T\u00f8ndel, nonetheless \u2014 a film that will keep you engaged if not entirely satisfied.",
      "\u201cArmand,\u201d an IFC Films release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csexual material and some language.\u201d Running time: 116 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "Producers have opted to self-distribute this powerful, pointed look at Israel's policies in seized land despite the movie earning an Oscar nomination and wins at the Berlin International Film Festival, Gotham Awards and Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards. \u201cNo Other Land\u201d is, in its nature, a piece of advocacy. There are no both-sidesing explored here. The filmmakers \u2014 a Palestinian-Israeli collective of four directors \u2014 make it clear they hope documenting their plight will get the United States to pressure Israel to stop the destruction.",
      "The documentary is largely told from the perspective of Basel Adra, an activist born in Masafer Yatta, a collection of villages in the southern mountains of the occupied West Bank. The Israelis have ordered Palestinians off the land to make room for a military training ground.",
      "Shot between 2019 and 2023 \u2014 filming ended before the Israel-Hamas war exploded \u2014 the bulldozers arrive and never stop, protected by soldiers and ripping through simple concrete homes. The residents retreat to caves, albeit with high-def TV connections. Then they try to rebuild, often under the stealth of night. Then the bulldozers return.",
      "\u201cThey destroy us slowly. Every week, a home,\u201d goes the narration. \u201cEvery week a new family must decide: Endure, or leave their land.\u201d",
      "Adra and Palestinian co-writer and co-director Hamdan Ballal are joined by an Israeli journalist, Yuval Abraham, who arrives in Masafer Yatta with the cinematographer Rachel Szor. Abraham is asked point blank on his arrival: \u201cWhat do you think about what your country is doing to us?\u201d His answer: \u201cI think it\u2019s a crime.\u201d",
      "It is a wrenching movie to see: Soldiers, with vague permission from a court that Palestinians have no say in, push old women and children, not answering their pleas to stop and merely waving away residents whose families have lived in the region since the 1830s. The residents can't vote and their license plates set them apart from Israelis. They're hoping enough likes on social media can change their plight.",
      "We see women carrying out their rugs from rubble and children bewildered as their outhouse is knocked down.",
      "\u201cWe have no other land,\u201d says one resident, giving the documentary its name. At one point, a playground is demolished. At another, a school. Then a well is filled with concrete and water lines are cut with a chainsaw. Sometimes, nearby Israeli settlers attack as soldiers stand by.",
      "The Palestinians are unarmed, except for cellphone cameras, which the soldiers clearly hate. When they march \u2014 a ragtag group with a banner reading \u201cPalestinian Lives Matter\u201d \u2014 they are met with stun grenades.",
      "Shaky cellphone footage of military altercations mix with archive footage, TV newscasts and dreamy, languid shots of dusty villages at night lit by naked bulbs. Sometimes current day images melt to those of a generation ago, when in home movies we see Adra's father protesting the same injustices, a never-ending cycle. His first memory is his father\u2019s first arrest.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d is a piece of resistance but also humanization. When Adra is about to be arrested, his mother says what mothers regularly do: \u201cGo wear a warmer coat,\u201d she counsels. Palestinian children laugh as they play games in the street, throw snowballs in winter and sway gleefully from makeshift swings.",
      "\u201cI hope we\u2019ll change this bad reality,\u201d says Adra at the end. \u201cI hope,\u201d chimes in Abraham.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d in movie theaters in select cities, is not rated but has language and violence throughout. Running time: 95 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "He sang 88 roles at the Met, and his performance total ranks ninth in the company\u2019s history. While many were as a comprimario, a supporting part surrounding the stars, he sang all three bass roles in Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cBoris Godunov,\u201d Philip II in Verdi\u2019s \u201cDon Carlo\u201d and for his 25th anniversary with the company the title role in Verdi\u2019s \u201d\u2018Falstaff.\u201d",

But the vast majority of his career was at the Met.

In other news, I\u2019m hosting the Oscars.\"",
      "The wildfires that consumed large parts of Los Angeles in early January led some to call for the cancellation of the Academy Awards.

The film, at one point, seemed like Netflix's best chance yet to land the streamer its first best picture nomination. Its star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, made history by becoming the first openly trans actor nominated for an Oscar.",
      "But no nominee has had a rockier post-nominations Oscar campaign. After old offensive tweets by Gasc\u00f3n were uncovered, the actress issued an apology. The fallout, though, has badly damaged a movie that was already a divisive contender, and led Netflix to radically refocus its flagging campaign.",

      "NEW YORK -- If you tune into the \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d on Sunday, you'll likely see a key person's influence \u2014 even if you don't actually see her.",
      "Victoria Schade is a dog trainer and novelist who's the show\u2019s lead puppy trainer and wrangler. She's the one making sure the shelter pups have a conflict-free contest and that they're captured at their most adorable \u2014 all from off-camera.",
      "It is Schade who gets the puppies to look up during the \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d or run through a tunnel to get to the field for the starting lineups. She\u2019s on the lookout for possible conflicts or nervous dogs.",
      "\u201cMy responsibilities include ensuring puppy happiness and safety during gameplay,\u201d she says. \u201cSo if there\u2019s any moment where a puppy looks like they\u2019re overwhelmed or they just need a break, I\u2019ll step out and give them a little break on the sideline.\u201d",
      "Schade has been working with the doggies on the Animal Planet show for 19 years and is believed to be the longest serving member of the \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d crew. She also works the kitten halftime show and calls filming both her favorite week of the year.",
      "\u201cI think she is one of the most dedicated, hardest working people out there in the business,\u201d says \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d referee Dan Schachner, now in his 14th year. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t ever seem to run out of energy. She never says no to a request and there\u2019s always brightness and sunshine from her with every step.\u201d",
      "Schade has coached hundreds of dogs over the years but never adopted one from the show \u2014 until now. She took home Boris \u2014 known on the show as Mr. Pickles \u2014 from Dallas Dog rescue. \u201cI saw star quality. So this was the year,\u201d she says.",
      "Early on, Schade was responsible for recruiting and selecting the puppies, a task now that leans on animal rescue groups and shelters throughout the country. These days, she's the lead trainer.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re seeing the puppy looking up at the camera, I\u2019m typically right there with the treat,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of treats and funny noises. And that does the trick.\u201d",
      "This year, Schade is stepping out from the sidelines and joining Schachner on camera for an hour-long pre-game kickoff show, which features a doggie combine and a draft. Other show highlights include segments with Dan Smyers, from superstar country duo Dan + Shay, and Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi.",
      "Schade has developed some very special animal-related skills over the years, including anticipating when one of the players needs to relieve itself.",
      "\u201cOne of my \u2018Puppy Bowl\u2019 skills is reading butts. So I know when a puppy is going to go to the bathroom and I\u2019ll typically say like, \u2018Watch out in the 20-yard-line, we\u2019re going to have a deposit\u2019 and everyone\u2019s ready to go with that cleanup.\u201d",
      "The \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d made its debut as counter-programming to the Super Bowl in 2005. Dogs score touchdowns on a gridiron carpet when they cross the goal line \u2014 any goal line \u2014 with a toy in their mouth.",
      "The show is really just an excuse to spend time watching adorable, clumsy pups play with chew toys, wag their tails furiously and lick the camera. A deeper reason is to encourage animal adoption.",
      "According to the ASPCA, approximately 390,000 shelter dogs are euthanized each year and 2 million shelter dogs are adopted.",
      "Most of the puppies are usually adopted by airtime, since the show was filmed in the fall. But the point is to show that animals just like the ones on the show can be found at any shelter at any time.",
      "This year's three-hour television event this year will feature 142 rescue puppies from 80 shelters across 40 states \u2014 and one from Nicaragua, a Chihuahua-German shepherd. There will be 11 special needs dogs.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the most amount we\u2019ve ever had,\" says Schachner. \"Look out for Jolene, who is a pitbull mix that\u2019s in a wheelchair. Look out for a three-legged Boston terrier from New York City. And my personal favorite, is Sprinkle, who is a blind and deaf Aussie. So it\u2019s just incredible to watch them play.\u201d",
      "The inaugural \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d was watched by nearly 6 million viewers. Last year, 12.6 million viewers tuned in. In comparison, this year\u2019s Golden Globes attracted 9.3 million.",
      "Schade, whose first book was \u201c Bonding With Your Dog \u201d and who then pivoted to writing pet-oriented novels, like \u201cLife on the Leash\u201d and \u201cDog Friendly,\u201d is a wealth of information about our four-legged friends.",
      "She advises dog owners to learn to read the body language of their pet, to try to understand what they're trying to say. Like tail-wagging \u2014 how tight? And where is the tail positioned?",
      "Schade is a big advocate for positive reinforcement and science-based training, not the so-called alpha dog approach, which uses intimidation or force.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be the alpha, which has been debunked anyway. You are your dog's ally. You\u2019re their friend. You\u2019re their No. 1. And it\u2019s a relationship based in compassion and understanding.\u201d",
      "That means load up on treats. She advocates keeping them in your pocket and consistently using them as rewards for good behavior, especially when potty training.",
      "\u201cI cannot stress it enough: When you think you\u2019re treating enough, treat more because, especially during puppyhood, it is such a critical learning period and every interaction is a chance to teach something.\u201d",

      "\u201cKinda Pregnant,\" starring Amy Schumer as a woman who fakes a baby bump, is a kinda throwback comedy",
      "We have by now become accustomed to the lengths some movie characters will go to keep a good comedy lie going. But it\u2019s still a special kind of feat when Amy Schumer, playing a baby-mad single woman who fakes a baby bump in \u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d is so desperate to maintain the fiction that she shoves a roast turkey up her dress.",
      "You might be thinking: This is too ridiculous. The stuffing, alone. But if we bought \u201cSome Like it Hot\u201d and \u201cMrs. Doubtfire,\u201d I see no reason to quibble with the set-up of \u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d a funny and often perceptive satire on motherhood, both real and pretend.",
      "\u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d which debuted Wednesday on Netflix, is a kinda throwback comedy. Like \u201c40-Year-Old Virgin\u201d and \u201cWedding Crashers,\u201d you can basically get the movie just from its title.",
      "But like any good high-concept comedy, \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d is predominantly a far-fetched way for its star and co-writer, Schumer, to riff frankly on her chosen topic. Here, that\u2019s the wide gamut of pregnancy experience \u2014 the body changes, the gender reveal parties, the personal jealousies \u2014 all while mixing in a healthy amount of pseudo-pregnant pratfalls.",
      "It\u2019s been a decade since Schumer was essentially launched as a movie star in the 2015 Judd Apatow-directed \u201cTrainwreck.\u201d But \u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d which Schumer wrote with Julie Paiva, almost as adeptly channels Schumer\u2019s comic voice \u2014 the one that made the sketch series \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d so great.",
      "The movie\u2019s opening flashes back to Lainey (Schumer) as a child playing with dolls and imagining herself a mother-to-be. So committed is she to the role that Lainey, in mock-labor, screams at her friend and then politely apologies: \u201cSorry, but the expectant mother often lashes out at her support system.\u201d",
      "But as middle age approaches, Lainey, a high school teacher in Brooklyn, isn\u2019t close to her dream. At the dinner where she suspects \u2014 no, is so certain that she tears open the desert looking for a ring \u2014 that her longtime boyfriend (Damon Wayans Jr.) is going to pop the question, he instead asks her to join a threesome. Back at school, Lainey\u2019s school lesson on \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d turns darkly cynical.",
      "Things are even worse when Lainey\u2019s married best friend (Jillian Bell) divulges that she\u2019s pregnant. \u201cGet rid of it!\u201d blurts Lainey before apologizing. When the pair later go clothes shopping, Lainey absentmindedly tries on belly padding. The saleswoman is instantly nice to her, offering a burrito and a foot rub. \u201cWho\u2019s the father?\u201d she asks. \u201cDoor dash,\u201d responds Lainey before adding, \u201cdriver.\u201d",
      "Much of the fun in \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d is watching Lainey come up with increasingly ridiculous lies as she tries to pull off the pregnant act. (After accidentally picking Thanksgiving as her time of inception, Lainey digs a deeper hole by suggesting it happened at \u201ca Black Friday Eve sale.\u201d)",
      "But the ruse becomes more difficult when she, during a pregnant workout class, meets a woman (Brianne Howey, refreshingly authentic) she genuinely likes and wants to be friends with. Even more complicated: Lainey starts falling for another guy she first meets at a coffee shop ( Will Forte ).",
      "In a movie filled with funny people (others include Urzila Carlson as a guidance counselor, and Alex Moffat as a idiotic father-to-be) Forte is an especially good presence in \u201cKinda Pregnant.\u201d For a performer of such madcap absurdity, Forte fits in remarkably naturally in a more rom-com setting. He\u2019s also got a wonderfully ridiculous occupation, even by rom-com standards, driving a Zamboni in Central Park.",
      "You can probably guess how \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d goes from here. Director Tyler Spindel, nephew to Adam Sandler (a producer on the film), doesn't do anything to advance the movie comedy, a languishing proposition in recent years with few big-screen exceptions. But he crucially gives his performers plenty of space to be themselves, and Lainey's desperate desire to have a family comes across as both over-the-top and genuine. If \u201cKnocked Up\u201d captured the comedy of getting unexpectedly pregnant, \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d embodies the pain of wishing you were.",
      "\u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d a Netflix release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for sexual content, language throughout and drug use. Running time: 97 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "\u201cSomething about hearing it that time just really mesmerized me and that was the beginning of my love of Bach,\u201d he said.",
      "The 31-year-old's hands move easily between the four keyboards of the organ console, flanked by knobs controlling different sounds that are assembled into various combinations.",
      "Underneath, his feet press on the pedalboards \u2014 combining to create the notes of Bach's works. MacKnight, who has played the organ since he was 16, acknowledges how dizzying the sight of the instrument can be for newcomers.",
      "\u201cIf you don't know what you're looking at, it's a little overwhelming, like an airplane console,\u201d he said.",
      "MacKnight's concerts \u2014 which are free and open to the public \u2014 are also mini-lessons for those who come, with a glossary of terms like concerto and fugue included in the program. In between pieces, MacKnight gives audience members some background on Bach and his organ works.",
      "\u201cThese pieces are in the unfortunate category of being much, much harder than they sound,\u201d he says.",
      "Generally regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, Bach is known in particular for his organ works and their heavy use of pedals and complex structures. Few organists perform the composer's complete organ works, given the difficulty and quantity of the music.",
      "They include Grammy-winning organist Paul Jacobs, who taught MacKnight at the Juilliard School. Jacobs performed an 18-hour nonstop concert of Bach's organ works to mark the 250th anniversary of the composer's death in 2000.",
      "The free concerts so far have drawn a mix of church members, classical music aficionados and newcomers who say they want a quiet break from the daily bustle.",
      "\u201cI like the complexity of the music and the power of the organ, which stirs me internally,\u201d said Barry Coplin, a member of the church who has attended two of MacKnight\u2019s concerts.",
      "Ben Wiley, who lives about 30 minutes away, is a classical music fan who was attending his third of MacKnight\u2019s shows and said he appreciates being able to hear Bach\u2019s works in half-hour increments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to be able to get it done in short bursts, to be able to absorb it better and come back to get the next batch,\u201d he said.",
      "MacKnight is also performing a 100-minute concert of Bach's most extensive organ work \u2014 the Clavier-Ubung III, sometimes referred to as the German Organ Mass \u2014 on July 28, the day the German composer died in 1750 at 65.",
      "The Rev. Thomas Alexander, a priest at Trinity, said the concerts allow the public to enjoy MacKnight's talents, come together and learn more about Bach in a way they normally wouldn't be able to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like reading someone's complete collection of novels. You get to really get to know someone in a comprehensive way,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBut it also builds a sense of community.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The New Jersey man charged with severely injuring author Salman Rushdie in a 2022 knife attack is standing trial in New York",
      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- In 2022, Salman Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture before a live audience in western New York when a man ran towards him and plunged a knife into the author\u2019s hand as he raised it in self-defense.",
      "\u201cAfter that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere,\u201d Rushdie recalled in a memoir that followed. \u201cI feel my legs give way, and I fall.\u201d",
      "In the coming weeks, Rushdie is expected to return to the same New York county to recount the experience as one of the first witnesses in the trial of the man charged with wielding the knife that day, Hadi Matar.",
      "Jury selection got underway Tuesday. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault.",
      "Under different circumstances, Rushdie\u2019s book, which details his account of that day and his recovery, might offer important evidence in the Aug. 12, 2022, attack that left the 77-year-old blind in his right eye and his hand permanently damaged.",
      "But \u201cthis isn\u2019t a back alley event that occurs unwitnessed in a dark alley,\u201d said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt following a pretrial hearing. \u201cThis is something that was recorded, it was witnessed live by thousands of people.\u201d",
      "Jurors will be shown video of the attack, as well as photos and documentation, and an estimated 15 witnesses are expected to take the stand. Judge David Foley said once jury selection is complete, the trial would take up to a week and a half.",
      "Matar\u2019s lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, has not explained how he plans to defend his client and has clapped back at critics who question why Matar did not take a plea deal.",
      "\u201cThat's not what this is about. It's about due process,\" Barone said. \u201cIt's about receiving a fair trial ... If someone wants to exercise those rights, they're entitled to do that.\"",
      "In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege that Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization\u2019s endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death. A separate trial on the federal charges \u2014 terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization \u2014 will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.",
      "Foley asked potential jurors Tuesday whether they could fairly consider a case involving someone of Muslim descent or with strong religious beliefs. All indicated they could.",
      "But finding jurors who have not already formed an opinion was proving harder.",
      "Nearly all of the 27 men and women being screened Tuesday said they knew about what happened to Rushdie, either from news reports or acquaintances, and several said they had formed opinions that are unlikely to change based on what they hear at trial",
      "Matar's attorney sought unsuccessfully to move the trial out of Chautauqua County last year, citing pretrial publicity and potential prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent among the small rural county's mostly white residents.",
      "Rushdie spent years in hiding after the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa in 1989 after publication of the novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.",
      "But jurors in the Chautauqua County case are unlikely to hear about the fatwa, according to Schmidt. He has said he doesn\u2019t anticipate needing to show Matar\u2019s possible motive to get a conviction on the state charges.",
      "\u201cFrom my standpoint, this is a localized event. It\u2019s a stabbing event. It\u2019s fairly straightforward,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI don\u2019t really see a need to get into motive evidence, whether that\u2019s applicable or not applicable and what that consists of. I\u2019d like to avoid all of that.\u201d",
      "Barone, the defense attorney, said jurors should be screened for prejudice nonetheless, given the discussions of the fatwa during previous court proceedings.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve talked about the reason why this alleged crime supposedly occurred was because of this book involving Muslims, all that. So it\u2019s kind of like the barn door\u2019s been opened,\u201d he said.",
      "Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. Rushdie is a native of India who lived for years in London. He became a U.S. citizen in 2016.",
      "Matar has been held without bail since his arrest after being subdued by onlookers who rushed the amphitheater stage. The event\u2019s moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, was also wounded."

      "LOS ANGELES -- A former friend who alleges rapper A$AP Rocky fired a gun at him in 2021 testified Monday that no one involved in the incident gave him any indication the firearm might have been fake \u2014 as the defense contends \u2014 until the day this trial started.",
      "The testimony from the trial\u2019s key witness, who goes by A$AP Relli, came at the end of a long, frustrating slog on the stand in a Los Angeles courtroom that drove him to shout, \u201cYou're annoying, bro!\u201d and much more at the lead defense attorney.",
      "In its re-direct questioning on Monday, the prosecution pushed back against the idea that for security Rocky carried a starter pistol that only shot blanks.",

      "Rihanna, the superstar singer who is Rocky\u2019s longtime partner and the mother of his two toddler sons, was not in the courtroom after being in the audience to support him for the trial\u2019s previous three days.",

      "A day earlier, the hip-hop star was up a Grammy Award for the third time at a ceremony just two miles away, but lost to one of the night\u2019s big winners, Kendrick Lamar.",
      "Relli who first took the stand on Wednesday, had been often evasive and just as often angry under cross-examination from Rocky's lawyer.",
      "That came to a head Monday as the defense got a chance to ask its last set of questions before he was excused.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on trial. I\u2019ve been here for five days, dealing with this man,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking stupid for five days.\u201d",
      "He ignored the judge\u2019s warnings not to make such statements.",

      "Last week, Relli had angrily declared that recordings of phone calls the defense played for him about getting money from Rocky were faked. Defense lawyers contend the only reason Relli went to police about the incident was so he could extract money from Rocky in the civil case he has also filed.",
      "On Monday, the man who recorded those calls, Wally Sajimi, took the stand as an out-of-order witness for the defense, and the jurors heard the recordings themselves.",
      "In one of them, a voice resembling Relli's says he'll stop participating in the criminal case as soon as he gets paid.",
      "\u201cOnce I walk away, when I get my cash, the case will get way weaker,\" says the recording that Sajimi testified he made in 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard for the DA to find me. Because I\u2019m going to be on another island.\u201d",

      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. Pavlovich identified herself in an interview with New York Magazine, which published an article in January detailing allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women.",
      "Pavlovich alleges in the lawsuits that she was homeless and living on a beach when she met Palmer in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2020. Pavlovich was 22 years old at the time.",
      "According to the lawsuits, Gaiman's wife, Amanda Palmer, invited Pavlovich to the couple's home on Waiheke Island. Pavlovich began running errands for the couple, babysitting their son and helping with chores, eventually becoming the couple's nanny.",
      "Gaiman first sexually assaulted her the night they met in February 2022, according to the lawsuits. The assaults continued but she kept working for the couple because she was broke and homeless and Gaiman had told her he would help her writing career, according to the lawsuits.",
      "When she told Palmer about the assaults, Palmer told her that more than a dozen women had told her in the past that Gaiman had sexually abused them, according to the lawsuits.",
      "The assaults didn't stop until Pavlovich told Palmer she was going to kill herself, the lawsuits said. She left the family and became homeless again, although the documents say Gaiman eventually paid her for her work caring for the couple's child and helped cover her rent for a few months.",
      "Palmer knew of Gaiman's sexual desires and presented Pavalovich to him knowing he would assault her, according the lawsuits. Pavlovich alleges Gaiman and Palmer violated federal human trafficking prohibitions and seeks at least $7 million in damages.",

Pavlovich\u2019s attorneys stated in the filings that Gaiman, author of such bestsellers as \u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Sandman\u201d series, is a resident of Menomonie, Wisconsin. But they\u2019re unsure if Palmer resides in Massachusetts or New York.",
      "Pavlovich told New York Magazine that she filed a police report in January 2023 accusing Gaiman of sexual assault. Police have not confirmed whether Gaiman was ever under investigation.",
      "Gaiman has worked with numerous publishers over the years. Two of them, HarperCollins and W.W. Norton, have said they have no plans to release his books in the future. Others, including Bloomsbury, have so far declined comment.",
      "Dark Horse Comics announced in January that it would no longer release its illustrated series based on Gaiman's novel, \u201cAnansi Boys.\u201d The seventh of eight editions was released earlier that month.",

      "NEW YORK -- WWE continues to expand its social media reach as its successful blend of wrestling and celebrities took center stage at its Royal Rumble premium live event over the weekend.",
      "The sports entertainment company said Monday that this year's Royal Rumble set a record for most social video views in the event's history. An encounter in the ring between wrestler Bron Breakker and popular streamer IShowSpeed became the most-viewed Royal Rumble social post of all-time, with more than 300 million social views in less than 24 hours.",

      "WWE currently has more than 100 million subscribers on YouTube.

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 19:38:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Women folk singers are preserving one of Morocco's most cherished culturual traditions, a genre of folk singing known as aita",
    "story": [
      "Women folk singers are preserving one of Morocco's most cherished culturual traditions, a genre of folk singing known as aita",
      "SIDI YAHYA ZAER, Morocco -- Mbarka Moullablad\u2019s family frowned when she first told them she planned to make a living as a cheikha, singing about love, pain, and societal change to the melodies of her ancestors under the stage name \u201cThouria.\u201d",
      "Women like her are the stewards of one of Morocco\u2019s most cherished oral traditions: a form of folk singing known as aita, which means a \u201ccry\u201d or \u201clament\u201d in Arabic. From smoky bars and cabarets in Morocco\u2019s largest cities to the gatherings in the country\u2019s rural regions, they croon at weddings, festivals and private events and pub nights, hypnotizing audiences both humble and wealthy.",
      "But despite aita's position in Moroccan culture, the genre\u2019s popularity does not always translate into acceptance for those who perform it. Cheikha are often stigmatized, eroticized, and pushed to society\u2019s margins. That was once a fear for Moullablad, but she says her community in Sidi Yahya Zaer, a farming town on Morocco\u2019s Atlantic plains, has mostly accepted her.",
      "\u201cMy family did not agree at first and I used to suffer from society\u2019s judgment, but now everything is good,\u201d Moullablad said on the sidelines of a recent performance south of Morocco\u2019s capital, Rabat. \u201cI do it in order to earn money for my children.\u201d",
      "A form of sung poetry, aita has long explored themes of societal triumphs, ironies, and unspoken struggles, including those related to relationships and economic hardship. Cheikha don heavy stage makeup, silk caftans, and golden takchita belts as they sing about their community's agonies and triumphs. They sway their hips to amplify emotion, dancing seductively or cheerfully depending on the context.",
      "When Moullablad performs, men and women lean in as her voice softens, captivated as she climbs octaves into a full-throated howl. The beads wrapped around her sister Fatiha\u2019s belly shake as she dances. The band leader, another singer, backs her with his own poetry while a drummer keeps the beat, a guitarist strums, and a violinist drags his bow in sync.",
      "Those who come to hear them sing say cheikha can serve as a community's truth-tellers, singing about often unspoken dynamics related to marriage, agriculture or, historically, colonial resistance. Moullablad sings in Moroccan Arabic, embodying traditions specific to her community. But cheikha across the North African Kingdom also perform in the indigenous Amazigh language, adapting the music and lyrics to reflect their region.",
      "The art form has inspired contemporary acts like the electro-infused \u201cAita, Mon Amour\u201d and Kabareh Cheikhats, a troupe of male actors who pay homage, dress and sing in the tune of Morocco's most celebrated 20th century women folk singers. It is also the subject of Morocco\u2019s submission for this year\u2019s Academy Awards, \u201cEverybody Loves Touda,\u201d which follows a single mother who leaves her town in the Atlas Mountains to pursue her dream of singing in bars, cabarets, and hotels in Casablanca.",
      "\u201cI was always amazed by their strength and the power that they have toward people when they open their mouths. Whether they are modern or conservative people, they all stand up and get into a kind of trance like gospel,\u201d Nabil Ayouch, the film\u2019s director, said in an interview when the film premiered at the Marrakech Film Festival last year.",
      "Morocco\u2019s music scene is increasingly embracing Middle Eastern pop and rap by North African artists from throughout the diaspora. And rural communities are shrinking amid the country's rapid development and urbanization. But though the future of aita may seem uncertain, its musicians and listeners remain confident that it will endure.",
      "\u201cAita will not die because it is renewed by young people. Aita will remain in all times and is loved by old people and young people as well. It is developed and improved, but they preserve its origins,\u201d said Rachid Kadari, a Cheikh who also sings aita."

      "Filmmaker Christophe Ruggia was sentenced Monday to two years under house arrest with an electronic bracelet plus a two-year suspended sentence. Ruggia had denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Haenel, now 35, was the first top actor in France to accuse the film industry of turning a blind eye to sexual abuse after the #MeToo movement broke out. In 2019, she accused Ruggia of having repeatedly touched her inappropriately during and after filming of the movie \u201cLes Diables,\u201d or \u201cThe Devils,\u201d in the early 2000s.",
      "Haenel appeared relieved, breathing deeply, as Monday's verdict was being released. She was applauded by some women\u2019s rights activists as she left the courtroom.",
      "The court ruled that Ruggia \u201ctook advantage of the dominant position\u201d he had on Haenel at the time. \u201cDuring quasi-weekly meetings at your home for over three years you had sexualized gestures and attitudes,\u201d as Haenel was \u201cgradually isolated\u201d from her loved ones, the court said in a statement.",
      "Ruggia's lawyer said her client would appeal.",
      "He \u201cmaintains that he has never touched Ad\u00e8le Haenel,\u201d the lawyer, Fanny Colin, said. \u201cSentenced in these conditions and on the sole basis of her words seems to us not only unjustified but dangerous.\u201d",
      "Haenel, star of the 2019 Cannes entry \u201cPortrait of a Lady on Fire,\u201d has in recent years vocally protested what she\u2019s called an insufficient response to sexual abuse in French filmmaking.",
      "At the C\u00e9sar Awards in 2020, she walked out of the ceremony after Roman Polanski won best director. Polanski is still wanted in the United States decades after he was charged with raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977.",
      "In 2023, Haenel, announced she was quitting the French film industry that she denounced for \u201ccomplacency toward sexual aggressors.\u201d She published an open letter in which she said Cannes and other pillars of the French film industry are \u201cready to do anything to defend their rapist chiefs.\u201d",
      "While #MeToo initially struggled to find traction in France, some other actors and film industry workers have since spoken out.",
      "French renowned actor Judith Godr\u00e8che attended Monday\u2019s verdict at the Paris courthouse. \u201cIt was a very moving and a very important moment that reminded me of things that, in my case, may go unpunished,\u201d she told reporters with tears in her eyes.",
      "Last year, Godr\u00e8che accused film director Beno\u00eet Jacquot of having raped and physically abused her in a six-year relationship that began when she was 14 years old. Jacquot, who has more than 50 director credits in film and television, was handed preliminary charges of rape, sexual assault and violence in July 2024.",
      "Godr\u00e8che is also accusing another film director, Jacques Doillon, of sexual abuse while he was directing a film when she was 15.",
      "Both Jacquot and Doillon have denied the allegations.",
      "In a separate case, French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu is to go on trial in March on charges of sexually assaulting two women on a film set.",

      "Beyonc\u00e9 winning the trophy for album of the year was the highlight of the Grammy Awards on Sunday, but there were plenty of other key moments",
      "All eyes at the Grammy Awards were on whether the most-nominated artist in the history of the telecast would finally walk away with the coveted album of the year trophy. She did. \u201cWe finally saw it happen,\u201d host Trevor Noah said, almost in relief.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 winning for \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d capped a night that turned into a tribute to a suffering Los Angeles, with city firefighters chosen to reveal the winner of the last award and speeches offering words of encouragement for communities devastated. The Grammys almost veered into a telethon; $7 million was pledged from viewers of the show.",
      "It was also a telecast where the best new artist nominees like Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter were given plenty of time to show why there's a deep well of talent coming up. And there was a shock return for The Weeknd, who had been boycotting the Grammys.",
      "Here are some of the night\u2019s notable moments:",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga were right there, as were Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish, but the honor of opening the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles was given to two local brothers deeply affected by the wildfires: Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith of the band Dawes.",
      "They lost one brother\u2019s home along with their childhood home, instruments and much else. They've advocated for victims, raised money and were included in the FireAid benefit concert on Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey truly epitomize the unique spirit that we are seeing in LA right now,\u201d host Trevor Noah said. \u201cWhat better way to start the Grammy Awards?\u201d",
      "Dawes then played Randy Newman's \u201cI Love L.A.\u201d surrounded by an all-star backing band: John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent.",
      "\u201cLook at these firefighters, ain\u2019t nothin like \u2018em nowhere,\u201d Taylor Goldsmith sang, altering the line: \u201cLook at these women/There ain\u2019t nothing like \u2019em nowhere.\u201d",
      "Doechii won the Grammy for best rap album, only the third woman to win in that category. And, with her mother by her side, she had a strong message for young Black girls.",
      "\u201cI know that there's some Black girl out there, so many Black women out there, that are watching me right now, and I want to tell you: You can do it. Anything is possible. Anything is possible,\u201d she said.",
      "\"Don\u2019t allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you, to tell you that you can\u2019t be here, that you\u2019re too dark, or that you\u2019re not smart enough, or that you\u2019re too dramatic, or you\u2019re too loud. You are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are, and I am a testimony right now. Good night!\u201d",
      "The win caps an astounding few years for the 26-year-old Floridian who mixes R&B, hip-hop, jazz, boundary-pushing sounds and samples, and adds theatricality. She playfully calls herself the \u201cswamp princess.\u201d",
      "Her 2024 mixtape, \u201dAlligator Bites Never Heal\u2033 went to No. 33 on the Billboard 200, No. 9 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop chart and No. 8 on the Top Rap Album chart.",
      "Her Grammy performance of \u201cCatfish\u201d and \u201cDenial Is a River\u201d was electric, with the singer-songwriter backed by over a dozen dancers in matching Thom Browne suits and she eventually stripped down to a white two-piece set.",
      "Chappell Roan was crowned best new artist and then used her speech to demand change in the music business.",
      "\u201cI told myself that if I ever won a Grammy and got to stand up here before the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a livable wage and health care, especially to developing artists,\u201d she said.",
      "Roan began her music career in 2015 when she signed with Atlantic Records, releasing several singles including \u201cPink Pony Club.\u201d In 2020, the label dropped her. She moved back to her hometown to work as a barista before releasing her debut full-length album.",
      "\u201cIt was devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and dehumanized,\u201d Roan said in her speech. \u201cRecord labels need to treat their artists as valuable employees with a livable wage and health insurance and protection.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Roan performed a rocking version of her \u201cPink Pony Club,\u201d joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys as she sang from atop a giant pink horse.",
      "Lady Gaga, accepting the trophy for best pop duo or group alongside Bruno Mars for their chart-topping collab, \u201cDie with a Smile,\u201d gave a shout-out to the trans community, targets of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love,\" Lady Gaga said.",
      "Not long after, Alicia Keys, being honored with The Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, also backed diversity and inclusion programs, another Trump target.",
      "\u201cThis is not the time to shut down the diversity of voices,\u201d said Keys. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen on this stage talented, hardworking people from different backgrounds with different points of view, and it changes the game. DEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift.\u201d",
      "The Grammy Awards had a powerful way to prove that they've changed. They got a surprise endorsement by The Weeknd, who was last on the Grammy stage in 2017.",
      "The pop superstar in 2020 slammed the Grammys, calling them \u201ccorrupt\u201d after he landed zero nominations despite a megahit album. \u201cYou owe me, my fans and the industry transparency,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Grammys CEO Harvey Mason jr., who started in his post in 2020, on Sunday said he understood the criticism and listed all the things the Academy has done to fix it.",
      "\u201cWe have completely re-made our membership, adding more than 3,000 women voting members. The Grammy electorate is now younger, nearly 40% people of color, and 66% of our members are new since we started our transformation,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the past few years, we have listened, we\u2019ve acted and we\u2019ve changed.\u201d",
      "Mason then introduced The Weeknd, who performed two tunes from his just-released album \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d \u2014 \u201cCry For Me\u201d and \u201cTimeless\u201d with special guest Playboi Carti. He wore a long druid's robe and the stage was smoky.",
      "Will Smith, hosting a tribute to the late Quincy Jones, marked his first appearance at a major awards show since since he slapped Chris Rock onstage at the Oscars in 2022.",
      "\u201cIn his 91 years, Q touched countless lives, but I have to say, he changed mine forever. You probably wouldn\u2019t even know who Will Smith was if it wasn\u2019t for Quincy Jones,\" Smith said.",
      "Smith has been banned from film academy ceremonies for 10 years but the Grammys are a different beast. He made no mention of the infamous Slap.",
      "Smith has previously nabbed Grammy wins in the short form music video (\u201cWill 2K\u201d), best rap solo performance (\u201cGetting\u2019 Jiggy Wit It,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d), and best rap performance by a duo or group (\u201cSummertime\u201d as the Fresh Prince with DJ Jazzy Jeff).",

      "Punxsutawney Phil\u2019s team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck\u2019s weather verdict as the sun rises",
      "Punxsutawney Phil's team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck's weather verdict as the sun rises on Sunday, telling the world whether he is predicting wintry conditions for the next six weeks or the relief of an early spring.",
      "The annual ritual goes back more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in European folklore, but it took Bill Murray's 1993 movie to transform it into what it is today, with tens of thousands of revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States and beyond.",
      "Last year's crowd may have been a record and organizers are bracing for a similar turnout on Sunday.",
      "If the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club members declare Phil did not see his shadow, that is said to usher in an early spring. If he does see it, it's six more weeks of winter, although what that means can be subjective.",
      "Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less than half the time.",
      "Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler's Knob: the faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to confirm their skepticism.",
      "Phil communicates his forecast through \u201cGroundhog-ese\u201d with the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club's leader. It's not as if he speaks in English words.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll like wink, he\u2019ll purr, he\u2019ll chatter, he\u2019ll \u2014 you know \u2014 nod,\u201d Dunkel said.",
      "Attendance is free but it costs $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction is made, some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh. The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.",
      "A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split time between Gobbler's Knob and Phil's longtime home at the town library. The club also is putting up large video screens and more powerful speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the proceedings.",
      "\"It\u2019s a holiday where you don\u2019t really owe anyone anything,\u201d said A.J. Dereume, who among the club's 15-member inner circle serves as Phil's handler. \u201cYou\u2019re grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that\u2019s just fun to believe in.\u201d",
      "Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring, Shadow and Sunny, although his family won't join him on stage for the big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily visits from Dereume and see a veterinarian at least once a year.",
      "The club's lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an \u201celixir of life\u201d that keeps him immortal.",
      "\u201cThere's only one Phil, and it's not something that can be handed down,\u201d Dunkel said. \u201cJust like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, there's only one.\u201d",
      "Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, are being held in many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces."

      "Dairy cattle in Nevada have been infected with a new type of bird flu that's different from the version that has spread in herds since last year",
      "Dairy cattle in Nevada have been infected with a new type of bird flu that's different from the version that has spread in U.S. herds since last year, Agriculture Department officials said Wednesday.",
      "The detection indicates that distinct forms of the virus known as Type A H5N1 have spilled over from wild birds into cattle at least twice. Experts said it raises new questions about wider spread and the difficulty of controlling infections in animals and the people who work closely with them.",
      "\u201cI always thought one bird-to-cow transmission was a very rare event. Seems that may not be the case,\u201d said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.",
      "A version of the H5N1 bird flu virus known as B3.13 was confirmed in March after being introduced to cattle in late 2023, scientists said. It has infected more than 950 herds in 16 states. The new version, known as D1.1, was confirmed in Nevada cattle on Friday, according to USDA. It was detected in milk collected as part of a surveillance program launched in December.",
      "\u201cNow we know why it's really important to test and continue testing,\u201d said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, who helped identify the first spillover.",
      "The D1.1 version of the virus was the type linked to the first U.S. death tied to bird flu and a severe illness in Canada. A person in Louisiana died in January after developing severe respiratory symptoms following contact with wild and backyard birds. In British Columbia, a teen girl was hospitalized for months with a virus traced to poultry.",
      "At least 67 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, mostly those who work closely with dairy or cattle, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "USDA officials said they would post genetic sequences and other information about the new form of the virus to a public repository later this week. Scientists said that would be key to understanding whether the spillover was a recent event or whether the virus has been circulating, perhaps widely, for longer.",
      "\u201cIf this turns out to have been something that crossed into cattle a couple months ago, a couple months is a long time not to detect it,\u201d said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona who has studied the H5N1 virus in cattle.",
      "He added that it's important for federal officials to share promptly information about a virus that has the potential to trigger a pandemic that could \u201cmake COVID seem like a walk in the park.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's a vital part of national security, global security, the well-being of people, of animals and of businesses in the U.S.,\u201d Worobey added.",

      "NEW YORK -- Black women in the U.S. died at a rate nearly 3.5 times higher than white women around the time of childbirth in 2023, as maternal mortality fell below prepandemic levels overall but racial gaps widened, according to federal health data released Wednesday.",
      "In 2021 and 2022, the maternal death rate for Black women was about 2.6 times higher than white women.",
      "The data suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic, at its peak, impacted all pregnant women. But \u201conce we went back to \u2018usual activities,\u2019 then the impact of systemic racism and unequal access (to medical care) ... came right back into place,\u201d said Dr. Amanda Williams, interim medical director for the March of Dimes.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's report Wednesday on the 2023 deaths was drawn from death certificates. The CDC counts women who died while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth. Accidental deaths are excluded.",
      "The report found:",
      "\u2014 The maternal death rate for white women dropped from 19 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2022 to 14.5 per 100,000 in 2023.",
      "\u2014 The rate for Black women went from 49.5 to a little above 50, though the report says that increase was not statistically significant.",
      "\u2014 The rate for Hispanic women dropped from about 17 to about 12.",
      "\u2014 The rate for Asian Americans fell from about 13 to about 11.",
      "In total, 669 women died in 2023 during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth, the CDC reported. That\u2019s down from 817 deaths in 2022 and 1,205 in 2021, when it was the highest in more than 50 years.",
      "Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes of maternal deaths.",
      "Among those infections is COVID-19. The coronavirus and its complications proved dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women\u2019s worries, experts say.",
      "COVID-19\u2019s overall impact on pregnancies declined as the pandemic subsided and as hospitals and birthing centers returned to normal operations.",
      "Also, the federal Medicaid program expanded to cover postpartum care for up to 12 months, instead of just seven weeks. That helped more moms recover and made them healthier for the next time they tried to have a baby, Williams said.",
      "The number of maternal deaths is also tied to the number of pregnancies. U.S. births have been declining, and fewer pregnancies contributes to fewer pregnancy-related deaths, noted Eugene Declercq, a maternal deaths researcher at Boston University.",
      "CDC officials refused an Associated Press request to talk to a report author.",
      "The government is still receiving and processing death reports from last year. But Declercq said his analysis of available data suggests the number of 2024 maternal deaths may end up about the same as 2023.",

      "LA CROSSE, Wis. -- A Wisconsin couple is suing Walgreens and a pharmacy benefits management company, alleging that their son died because he couldn't afford a sudden $500 spike in his asthma medication.",
      "Shanon and William Schmidtknecht, of Poynette, filed their lawsuit in federal court in Milwaukee on Jan. 21, a year to the day that their son Cole died at age 22.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Cole Schmidtknecht suffered from asthma all his life. He managed it with daily doses of the medication Advair Diskus and its generic equivalents, which he ingested through an inhaler.",
      "He stopped at a Walgreens pharmacy in Appleton on Jan. 10, 2024, to refill his prescription and was told the cost had jumped from $66 to $539 out-of-pocket. Unable to afford the new cost, he left the pharmacy without the medication. He tried to manage his condition with his rescue inhaler but suffered a fatal asthma attack days later, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The Schmidtknechts allege that pharmacy benefits management company OptumRX violated Wisconsin law by raising the cost of the medication without a valid medical reason and failing to provide 30 days' advance notice of drug price increases.",
      "Pharmacy benefits managers act as intermediaries between health insurance companies, prescription drug companies and pharmacies. Optum Rx services prescription claims for more than 66 million people across the United States, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the Walgreens pharmacy staffers failed to offer Cole any workarounds to obtain his usual medication. They told him there were no cheaper alternatives or generic medications available, they didn't contact OptumRx to request an exception on Cole's behalf, and they didn't ask Cole's doctor to request an exception for him, his parents contend.",
      "The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.",
      "\u201cThe conduct of both OptumRx and Walgreens was deplorable,\u201d one of the family's attorneys, Michael Trunk, said in a statement. \u201cThe evidence in this case will show that both OptumRx and Walgreens put profits first, and are directly responsible for Cole\u2019s death.\"",
      "OptumRx spokespeople didn't immediately reply to Wednesday messages seeking comment. In a statement last April extending sympathy to the family, the company said that a review of Cole's claims showed that on the day he visited the pharmacy, he did buy a different asthma medication, generic Albuterol, for a $5 co-pay on Jan. 10 \u2014 a medication that it says he also obtained in October 2023. His case was handled \u201cconsistent with industry practice and the patient's insurance plan design,\u201d the company said.",
      "Trunk, though, said Wednesday that the $5 generic prescription Cole filled was for his rescue inhaler, not the Advair Diskus inhaler that he took daily. He said Cole was not able to fill his Advair Diskus prescription because it had suddenly become too expensive.",
      "Walgreens officials didn't immediately respond to a Wednesday email seeking comment on the lawsuit."

      "Responding to this outbreak could prove difficult because Kampala has a highly mobile population of about 4 million. The nurse who died had sought treatment at a hospital just outside the capital and later traveled to Mbale in the country\u2019s east, where he was admitted to a public hospital.

      "NEW YORK -- New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday told hospitals that they would be violating state law if they stop offering gender-affirming care for people under age 19 in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump aimed at curtailing federal funding for such treatments.",
      "In a letter, James, a Democrat, told health care facilities that refusing to provide the treatments would violate New York's anti-discrimination laws.",
      "\"Regardless of the availability of federal funding, we write to further remind you of your obligations to comply with New York State laws,\" her letter reads.",
      "Trump, a Republican, last week signed an executive order that directed agencies to take steps to make sure that hospitals receiving federal research and education grants \u201cend the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\u201d The language in the order \u2014 using words such as \u201cmaiming,\u201d \u201csterilizing\u201d and \u201cmutilation\u201d \u2014 contradicts what is typical for gender-affirming care in the United States.",
      "The letter from James came as some hospitals in Colorado, Virginia and Washington, D.C., said they were pausing gender-affirming treatments for young people while administrators evaluate the order. The White House on Monday released a statement that said the executive order was \u201calready having its intended effect.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's effort to ban federal funding for gender-affirming care for young people is facing a legal challenge",
      "Seven families with transgender or nonbinary children filed a lawsuit Tuesday over President Donald Trump's executive orders to narrowly define the sexes and halt federal support for gender-affirming health care for transgender people under age 19.",
      "PFLAG, a national group for family of LGBTQ+ people; and GLMA, a doctors organization, are also plaintiffs in the court challenge in a Baltimore federal court.",
      "It comes one week after Trump signed an order calling for the federal government to stop funding the medical care through federal government-run health insurance programs including Medicaid and TRICARE.",
      "Kristen Chapman, the mother of one of the plaintiffs in the case, said her family moved to Richmond, Virginia, from Tennessee in 2023 because of a ban on gender-affirming care in their home state. Her 17-year-old daughter, Willow, had an initial appointment scheduled for last week with a new provider who would accept Medicaid. But Trump signed his order the day before and the hospital said it could not provide care.",
      "\u201cI thought Virginia would be a safe place for me and my daughter,\u201d Kristen Chapman said in a statement. \"Instead, I am heartbroken, tired, and scared.\u201d",
      "She's not the only one, Brian Bond, the CEO of PFLAG, said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cWe are receiving a drumbeat of calls from parents whose kids' care is being canceled.\u201d",
      "The ACLU and Lambda Legal, who are representing the plaintiffs, want a judge to put the order on hold. In a court filing Tuesday, they said Trump's executive orders are \u201cunlawful and unconstitutional\u201d because they seek to withhold federal funds previously authorized by Congress and because they violate antidiscrimination laws. The challenge also says that the order infringes on the rights of parents.",
      "Like legal challenges to state bans on gender-affirming care, they also argue that the policy discriminates because it does not prohibit federal funds for the same treatments when they're not used for gender transition.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "Some health providers immediately paused providing the coverage while they assess how the order affects them. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has repeatedly battled Trump in court, told hospitals in her state Monday that it would violate the law to stop offering gender-affirming care to people under 19.",
      "Josh Block, an ACLU lawyer on the case, said that medical providers should continue gender-affirming care for people under 19. \u201cIt should not take either a protest, a letter from the attorney general or a TRO,\u201d or temporary restraining order from the court for them to do so.",
      "Trump's approach on transgender policy represents an abrupt change from the Biden administration, which sought to explicitly extend civil rights protections to transgender people.",
      "Trump has used strong language, asserting in the order on gender-affirming care that \"medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child\u2019s sex.\u201d",
      "Alex Sheldon, executive director of GLMA, the doctors group in the legal challenge, said there are established medical standards for caring for transgender youth. \u201cNow, an extreme political agenda is trying to overrule that expertise, putting young people and their providers in danger,\" Sheldon said in a statement. \"We are confident that the law, science, and history are on our side.\u201d",
      "In addition to the orders on health care access and defining the sexes as unchangeable, Trump has also signed orders that open the door to banning transgender people from military service and set up new rules about how schools can teach about gender.",
      "Legal challenges have already been filed on the military order and a plan to move transgender women in federal prisons to men's facilities. Others are expected to be filed, just as there have been challenges to a variety of Trump's policies.",
      "Researchers have found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents receive the care, which includes treatments such as puberty blockers, hormone treatments and surgeries \u2014 though surgery is rare for children.",
      "As transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance in some ways, there's been vehement pushback. At least 26 states have passed laws to restrict or ban the care for minors. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments last year but has not yet ruled on whether Tennessee's ban on the care is constitutional.",

      "Speaking in a mountain county hit by the historic flooding, the new Democratic governor said he wants his $1.07 billion request enacted now by the Republican-controlled General Assembly \u2014 rather than wait for the two-year budget that starts in July, for which he'll make an additional Helene appeal.",
      "At a news conference at a food bank in Mills River, about 260 miles (420 kilometers) west of Raleigh, Stein said the funds are urgently needed in the first half of the year \u201cso that people can get their lives back together.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we do not act, some businesses will not be here in the summer, and we will miss an entire building season before the winter weather comes again,\u201d he warned, calling the funds a high priority.",
      "The largest chunks of his proposal, which contains no tax increases, would fund grants for struggling businesses; help repair and rebuild homes; clean up farm debris; fix private bridges and roads; and replace revenues spent or lost by local governments. There's also money for summer school in districts that lost at least 15 instructional days shortly after Helene's rampage last September.",
      "\u201cWe can ensure that our students are set up for long-term academic success.,\u201d Stein said. \u201cAll of these components are necessary to building a safer, stronger and more resilient western North Carolina, and they are needed now.\u201d",
      "The state legislature already appropriated last fall well over $900 million for relief and rebuilding efforts and earmarked a couple of hundred million more for that purpose in the future. New House Speaker Destin Hall has said getting bipartisan early-session Helene funding bill to Stein's desk was a top priority.",
      "Advancing Monday's package could provide an early test for Stein, who was sworn in last month, in his efforts to find consensus with Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger. While Republicans control both chambers, they are one seat short of a veto-proof majority.",
      "GOP Rep. Jake Johnson of Polk County, who served on a bipartisan Helene advisory committee organized by Stein last year, spoke at the news conference with an optimistic tone.",
      "\u201cWe will start reviewing the governor\u2019s proposed budget and figuring out how we can get these dollars to people who need them the most right now,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Berger spokesperson Lauren Horsch said Monday that the Senate is reviewing Stein\u2019s proposal and anticipates considering Helene legislation in the coming weeks. Even with the money already put toward the recovery, Horsch added, \u201cthere is still more we can do.\u201d",
      "North Carolina state officials reported over 100 deaths from Helene with 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads damaged. The state budget office estimated that Helene caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "Helene made landfall last Sept. 26 in Florida\u2019s Big Bend and swept far inland, upending life throughout the Southeast. Officials have warned that rebuilding from the widespread loss of homes and property would be lengthy and difficult.",
      "Stein's request to spend money currently sitting in two reserves emphasizes speed.",
      "The $150 million sought for a home reconstruction, repair and buyout program is designed so such work can begin immediately while awaiting the distribution from Washington of similar housing assistance, which could take a year. The state program could assist at least 225 of 5,100 homes estimated to need rebuilding, Stein\u2019s request says.",
      "Stein also wants $150 million for two business grant programs designed to provide up to $75,000 to companies that suffered significant sales and economic losses, it physical damages.",
      "Stein said on Monday that \u201ctaking on additional business debt is simply not the answer for small businesses that are already struggling.\u201d",
      "In a special session last week, Tennessee lawmakers approved Gov. Bill Lee\u2019s $470 million package offering further aid for communities ravaged by Helene in the northeast part of that state. The package will help local governments cover loan interest on recovery costs, fuel agricultural and business recovery, fund disaster-related unemployment aid, and pay for rebuilding a badly damaged high school.",

      "Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma after Rwanda-backed rebels captured the major city in eastern Congo last week",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma, a major city in eastern Congo, as fighting rages on between government forces and the Rwanda-backed rebels who seized the city of around 2 million people.",
      "\u201cThey will get infected before we can treat them all,\u201d said Florence Douet, an operating room nurse at Bethesda Hospital, as she attended to patients with varying degrees of injuries.",
      "Since the start of the M23 rebels' offensive on Goma on Jan. 26, more than 700 people have been killed and nearly 3,000 have been wounded in the city and its vicinity, officials say. Bethesda Hospital alone said it receives more than 100 new patients each day, overstretching its capacity of 250 beds.",
      "Bethesda is one of several hospitals in Goma that The Associated Press visited that has inadequate personnel and supplies. The city hosts many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced by the conflict, which is one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",
      "As more people arrived at the hospitals with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, many were forced to share beds while others lay on the floor, writhing in pain as they waited for medical attention.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m experiencing this,\" said Patrick Bagamuhunda, who was wounded in the fighting. \u201cThis war has caused a lot of damage, but at least we are still breathing.\u201d",
      "The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012, when they first captured Goma before withdrawing under international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "Unlike in 2012, the rebels say they now plan to march to Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) away, describing the country as a failed state under President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi.",
      "The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia group. Rwanda said the group is \"fully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies the charges.",
      "Medical workers at Kyeshero Hospital in Goma say they are treating an increasing number of patients with bullet wounds.",
      "\"We removed 48 bullets yesterday,\u201d Johnny Kasangati, a surgeon, said Friday as he examined a patient under a tent.",
      "Kyeshero is also severely overcrowded, hitting more than 200% of its capacity on some days, according to Joseph Amadomon Sagara, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, which runs the hospital.",
      "In the past, hospitals in Goma could transport wounded patients by boat to South Kivu's main Bukavu city, 180 kilometers (111 miles) to the south, but transport across Lake Kivu was suspended during the rebellion and roads have been mostly cut.",
      "The fighting in and around Goma has also disrupted supply chains, leading to shortages in medical supplies that aid groups rely on. Some of it previously entered the city through its international airport, which is now under rebel control.",
      "\u201cGoma was cut off from the world. It was a total blackout,\" said Virginie Napolitano, Goma's emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders.",
      "The aid group's stockpiles, along with those of other groups, have been looted.",
      "\"We\u2019re getting by with what we had in the cabinets, but I don\u2019t know for how long,\u201d Napolitano said.",
      "Congo's government has confirmed 773 deaths and 2,880 injured persons at morgues and hospitals. The toll could be higher, it said, citing fears of finding mass graves and more bodies.",
      "The Maternit\u00e9 de la Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Goma was among those struggling to find space for the dead.",
      "\u201cWe had 66 bodies here. Fifty-six were transferred to the provincial hospital, where the morgue has more space than ours,\" said Jules Kafitiye, the hospital's medical director.",
      "\"We need to avoid decomposition due to disease,\u201d he added, pointing to a tent where bodies were being stored.",
      "Scores of bodies lay on streets and in hospitals in Goma after the city's capture, raising fears of disease outbreaks in the region, which is also facing mpox and cholera outbreaks.",
      "The U.N. health body warned last week that repeated mass displacement in Congo has created ideal conditions for the spread of endemic diseases in displacement camps and surrounding communities, including cholera, which saw more than 22,000 infections last year, and measles, which affected close to 12,000 people. The region also battles with chronic child malnutrition.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a fear for the disease to be spreading widely in communities,\u201d said Dr. Boureima Hama Sambo, the World Health Organization\u2019s representative in Congo. \u201cBut at this point, we cannot say because we have not been able to get there.\u201d",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has ordered state employees back to their offices full-time starting next month.",
      "In an executive order issued Tuesday, DeWine required all permanent employees of state agencies, boards and commissions to resume five-day, in-office work weeks no later than March 17. He said the move will allow the state to best serve the public and to make best use of its remaining office space. Both are in the best interests of Ohio citizens, he wrote.",
      "The return date set by DeWine falls almost five years to the day after the state declared an emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 9, 2020, and allowed certain employees to work remotely.",
      "Many of those workers either returned to their offices full-time or on a hybrid basis starting in June 2021, when the emergency was lifted.",
      "Tuesday's order requires virtually all employees to now return. It allows agencies to grant exceptions in cases where some or all of their real estate portfolios have been eliminated. Lease terminations and space reallocations that resulted from the coronavirus pandemic saved Ohio taxpayers millions of dollars, the order says.",
      "According to the document, a majority of Ohio's state employees actually never worked remotely, due to the nature of their work at state hospitals, prisons, law enforcement agencies or in other jobs requiring a physical presence.",
      "DeWine's mandate comes as some major Columbus employers, including American Electric Power and JPMorganChase, also have required a return to five-day work weeks in March. Republican President Donald Trump also is requiring federal workers to return full-time to offices, an order that's as part of an unprecedented series of steps aimed at shrinking the federal government."

      "The message confirmed Madhuku's fears that Trump's return to office might affect his organization's efforts to save African girls from child marriages.",
      "Many Africans had known that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d outlook meant their continent was likely to be last among his priorities. But they hadn't expected the abrupt halt to foreign aid from the world's largest donor that stops money flowing for wide-ranging projects like disease response, girls' education and free school lunches.",
      "Even after global outrage prompted some exemptions to Trump's order, sub-Saharan Africa could suffer more than any other region as most global aid pauses 90 days for a spending review. The U.S. gave the region more than $6.5 billion in humanitarian assistance last year.",
      "For Madhuku and countless others, the damage has been done. His Platform For Youth and Community Development is one of hundreds of small non-governmental organizations in Africa that receive assistance from the U.S. government \u2014 and ultimately from the American people \u2014 to do good work.",

      "\u201cWe had to stop everything, no warning, no time to adjust,\" Madhuku said. \u201cI appreciate that Trump might have some justification in trying to account for American taxpayers\u2019 money ... but it has caused disaster here.\u201d",
      "For many in Africa, thoughts immediately turned to arguably the world's most successful foreign aid program, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.",

      "\u201cThe world is baffled,\u201d the health minister of South Africa, the country with the most people living with HIV, said after the U.S. freeze on aid.",
      "The minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, said the U.S. funds nearly 20% of South Africa\u2019s $2.3 billion annual HIV/AIDS program through PEPFAR, and now the biggest response to a single disease in history is under threat.",
      "More than 8 million in South Africa live with HIV, and authorities say PEPFAR helps provide life-saving antiretroviral treatment to 5.5 million people every day.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that programs offering \u201clife-saving\u201d assistance including medicine, medical services, food and shelter would be exempted from the aid freeze, though what qualifies is not immediately clear.",
      "The United Nations AIDS program said many organizations receiving PEPFAR funding had closed due to the aid pause and there was \"lack of clarity and great uncertainty about the future.\u201d More than 20 million people globally receive HIV treatment with PEPFAR support, UNAIDS said.",
      "In South Africa's largest city, Johannesburg, and elsewhere, PEPFAR-funded facilities were still shut days after the exemptions were announced and HIV patients were referred to government hospitals and clinics.",
      "In Johannesburg's largest township, Soweto, two workers at the PEPFAR-funded HIVSA center turned patients away. And a notice at the renowned Wits RHI Key Populations Clinic, which serves adults and children living with HIV, read: \u201cWe apologize for the inconvenience this causes.\"",
      "Experts said the effects on HIV programs remain unclear but the consequences could be swift, even dangerous.",
      "\"We need to know a lot more before we can say people won\u2019t die directly because of the pause to funding,\u201d said Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, noting that while the waiver should cover HIV drugs, HIV diagnostic tests are also critical to ensure treatment gets to those who need it.",
      "Kenny said even short interruptions to antiretroviral treatment \u2014 which stops the virus replicating in the body \u2014 are risky.",
      "\u201cHIV viral loads rebound in about three weeks if you go off antiretrovirals,\u201d he said.",
      "Overall, even senior officials in the aid community are not sure which U.S.-funded programs are allowed to at least briefly continue operations.",
      "The Trump administration has warned contractors and staffers with USAID \u2014 the agency responsible for dispersing America\u2019s foreign aid \u2014 they could be disciplined if they speak to anyone outside the agency without top-level approval, and aid groups fear they may permanently lose funds if they speak publicly.",
      "A humanitarian official told The Associated Press that at least 1.2 million people in Congo could lose life-saving support because of the aid freeze. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said almost half of their organization\u2019s funding is from USAID.",
      "Overall, more than $100 million for the organization\u2019s humanitarian programs in more than 30 countries worldwide has been halted, according to the official.",
      "The block on aid came during a major escalation in fighting in eastern Congo, where millions of people were already displaced and where outbreaks of the mpox virus were declared a global health emergency last year.",
      "In civil-war-torn Sudan, which is grappling with cholera, malaria, and measles, the aid freeze means 600,000 people will be at grave risk of catching and spreading those diseases, the official said.",

      "The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and under siege from a contagious disease known as the \u201cstrangling angel\u201d for the way it suffocated children",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome faced a bleak winter. It was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and unrelenting blizzards, and under siege from a contagious disease known as the \u201cstrangling angel\u201d for the way it suffocated children.",
      "Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors \u2014 the sled dogs and mushers who raced for more than five days through hypothermia, frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to deliver life-saving serum and free the community from the grip of diphtheria.",
      "Among the events celebrating the centennial of the 1925 \u201cGreat Race of Mercy\u201d are lectures, a dog-food drive and a reenactment of the final leg of the relay, all organized by the Nome Kennel Club.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fluff around celebrations like this, but we wanted to remember the mushers and their dogs who have been at the center of this heroic effort and ... spotlight mushing as a still-viable thing for the state of Alaska,\u201d said Diana Haecker, a kennel club board member and co-owner of Alaska\u2019s oldest newspaper, the Nome Nugget.",
      "\u201cPeople just dropped whatever they were doing,\" she said. \"These mushers got their teams ready and went, even though it was really cold and challenging conditions on the trail.\u201d",
      "Other communities are also marking the anniversary \u2014 including the village of Nenana, where the relay began, and Cleveland, Ohio, where the serum run's most famous participant, a husky mix named Balto, is stuffed and displayed at a museum.",
      "Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16 Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala's team.",
      "Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating film to develop at the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S.",
      "Nome, western Alaska\u2019s largest community, had about 1,400 residents a century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall, before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn't worried. He hadn\u2019t seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had practiced in the area.",
      "Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: \"An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here.\u201d",
      "The first death was a 3-year-old boy on Jan. 20, 1925, followed the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine.",
      "West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to get them to Seattle and then onto a ship for Seward, an ice-free port south of Anchorage. In the meantime, enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital.",
      "It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains that reached Nome.",
      "Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior Alaska, some 675 miles (1,086 kilometers) from Nome via the frozen Yukon River and mail trails.",
      "Thanks to Alaska\u2019s new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers \u2014 many of them Alaska Natives \u2014 with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn\u2019t see the dogs in front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times to minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 51 degrees Celsius).",
      "The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded quilts. Not a single vial broke.",
      "Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog Togo, traveled more than 250 miles (320 kilometers) of the relay, including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound.",
      "After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on Feb. 2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle proclaimed: \u201cDogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken Nome.\u201d",
      "The official record listed five deaths and 29 illnesses. It\u2019s likely the toll was higher; Alaska Natives were not accurately tracked.",
      "Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant, Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was another of Seppala\u2019s dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team.",
      "Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York's Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his neck.",
      "But he and several team members were eventually sold and kept in squalid conditions at a dime museum in Los Angeles. After learning of their plight, an Ohio businessman spearheaded an effort to raise money to bring them to Cleveland. After dying in 1933, Balto was mounted and placed on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",
      "Today, the most famous mushing event in the world is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which is not based on the serum run but on the Iditarod Trail, a supply route from Seward to Nome. Iditarod organizers are nevertheless marking the serum run's centennial, with a series of articles on its website and by selling replicas of the medallions each serum run musher received a century ago, race spokesperson Shannon Noonan said in an email. This year's Iditarod starts March 1.",
      "\u201cThe Serum Run demonstrated the critical role sled dogs played in the survival and communication of remote Alaskan communities, while the Iditarod has evolved into a celebration of that tradition and Alaska\u2019s pioneering spirit,\u201d Noonan said.",

    "story": [
      "A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing through Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing into Egypt on Saturday for treatment",
      "RAFAH CROSSING, Egypt -- A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing to Egypt for treatment through Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing on Saturday, the first opening of the border since Israel captured it nearly nine months ago.",
      "The reopening of the Rafah crossing represents a significant breakthrough that bolsters the ceasefire deal Israel and Hamas agreed last month. Israel agreed to reopen the crossing after Hamas released the last living female hostages in Gaza.",
      "Egypt's Al-Qahera television showed at least two Palestinian Red Cross ambulances pulling up to the crossing gate. Several children were brought out on gurneys and transferred to ambulances on the Egyptian side. From there, they were rushed to hospitals in the nearby Egyptian city of el-Arish and elsewhere. Footage showed one young girl whose foot had been amputated.",
      "Zaher al-Wahidi, an official with Gaza's Health Ministry, said 37 of the children had crossed into Egypt by Saturday evening.",
      "The Health Ministry said around 60 family members were accompanying the children.",
      "The children are the first in what are meant to be regular evacuations of Palestinians through the crossing for treatment abroad.",
      "Over the past 15 months, Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in retaliation for the militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel has decimated Gaza\u2019s health sector, leaving most of its hospitals out of operation even as more than 110,000 Palestinians were wounded by Israel\u2019s bombardment and ground offensives, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.",
      "Remaining facilities are unable to perform many crucial treatments or specialized surgeries for wounds or diseases. Mohammed Zaqout, the director of hospitals in Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, said more than 6,000 patients were ready to be evacuated abroad, and more than 12,000 patients were in urgent need of treatment. He said the small numbers set to be evacuated will not cover the need, \u201cand we hope the number will increase.\u201d",
      "Rafah is Gaza\u2019s only crossing that does not enter into Israel. Israeli forces closed the crossing in early May after seizing it during an offensive on the southern city. Egypt shut down its side of the passage in protest.",
      "Even before the Gaza war began, the Rafah crossing represented a crucial escape valve from the territory, where a 15-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade aimed at containing Hamas undermined health facilities and impoverished the population. Palestinians routinely applied for permission to travel outside the territory for lifesaving treatments not available in Gaza, including chemotherapy.",
      "It took some diplomatic gymnastics to reopen the crossing and overcome security disputes between Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian officials. Hamas had overseen the border since 2007, when it took control of Gaza from its rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, or PA, after winning parliamentary elections in 2006.",
      "Israeli troops remain at the Rafah crossing and in the Philadelphia Corridor, a band of land running the length of the border. Israel has refused to allow Hamas to resume management of the crossing, accusing it of smuggling weapons through tunnels under the border, though Egypt says it destroyed the tunnels from its side and stopped smuggling years ago. Israel also refuses to allow the Palestinian Authority to officially run the crossing.",
      "Instead, the crossing will be staffed by Palestinians from Gaza who previously served as border officers with the PA, but they will not be allowed to wear official PA insignia, a European diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to brief the media. Israel has screened the officers to ensure they have no affiliation with Hamas, the European diplomat added.",
      "European Union monitors will also be present, as they were before 2007.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase of the deal \u2014 which calls for a permanent ceasefire, full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of any remaining hostages \u2014 are supposed to begin Monday. Israel has resisted the notion that the PA would control postwar Gaza."

    "story": [
      "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world\u2019s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rat infestation in many world cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington, and a new study blames climate change, urbanization and other human actions.",
      "A first-of-its-kind examination of trends and reasons in hard-to-count rat populations uses rat sighting reports in 16 cities around the world. In 11 of those cities, rat complaints have increased, according to a study in Friday's journal Science Advances.",
      "Based on individual trends within cities, Washington was by far the leader in rat increases, followed by San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam. Washington's rising rat reporting trend was three times greater than Boston's and 50% more than New York's, the study said. Washington city officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Only three cities saw significant decreasing trends \u2014 New Orleans, Louisville and Tokyo \u2014 with the home of Mardi Gras showing the biggest drop in rat reporting. Experts said the Louisiana city can teach others how to combat the rat problem.",
      "Researchers did a statistical analysis of the rising rat reporting in those cities and concluded that slightly more than 40% of the trend seen is due to warming temperatures from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. And that comes down to sex and food, said study lead author Jonathan Richardson, a biologist at the University of Richmond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these increasing trends in rats in cities that are warming the fastest, probably because this is a small mammal that has physiological challenges in the cold weather months,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf we're warming the climate and winter starts a week or two later and spring arrives a week or two earlier, that's one, two, maybe even three or four weeks across the entire year where those rats can be above ground foraging, acquiring more food and maybe squeezing out one or two more reproductive cycles. \u201d",
      "An extra month may not sound like much, but female rats can have a litter every month. Each litter is eight to 16 baby rats, Richardson said: \u201cThat is a recipe for accelerated population growth.\u201d",
      "Researchers pointed to two other big statistical links \u2014 that fit with known biological issues \u2014 behind more rat reports: the increase in urbanization and more densely populated cities.",
      "Rats like the built-up environment and being near people and their waste, the study and outside scientists said. They essentially eat at the same table as humans, multiple experts said.",
      "\u201cThe rat is the third most successful mammal behind humans and house mice. So it evolved and engineered to live alongside us,\u201d New York City rat czar Kathleen Corradi said during a break at a New Orleans conference on improving pest management. \u201cThey followed humans, Homo sapiens, across the continents and are in every single continent except Antarctica. So it's considered a wicked problem.\u201d",
      "Even though rats are intelligent and highly adaptive, Richardson and other experts said they are a serious problem for people.",
      "\u201cWhen rodent populations are high, people get sick, motor vehicles become disabled, mental health declines, fires are started and foods fouled,\u201d said Houston rat expert Michael Parsons, who wasn't part of the study. People are rightly bothered by rats because of \u201can innate fear caused by an organism that can make us sick.\u201d",
      "Researchers have not had good figures on rats. Because of the way they live and hide, they are not as easily counted as other critters, so this is one of the first attempts to quantify them. The study is not really a count of rats, but of complaints by people.",
      "Because the statistics go back years and only cities that haven't changed their reporting methods were looked at, Richardson said the trends they spotted have scientific merit. Even though Washington has the highest increasing trend that doesn't mean it has more rats or even rat sightings, it is just that the numbers within the city are increasing fastest, he said.",
      "Several outside experts said the study is legitimate, sensible and was sorely needed.",
      "\u201cThis paper is by far the largest data-driven effort to understand changes in urban rat populations ever attempted,\u201d said Drexel University ecology professor Jason Munshi-South, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Looking at the few cities where rat reports are down may help in the fight against rats, Richardson and Corradi said. The answer is not more poison or traps, but prevention, the study said.",
      "\u201cIn New Orleans they make a big effort to get out into neighborhoods and do educational workshops and campaigns to talk to residents about what makes a property less likely to have rats,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "New York City's recently stepped up rat-fighting, which includes replacing garbage in bags on the street with rat-resistant containers, hasn't quite shown up in Richardson's data yet, but rat czar Corradi said early results are encouraging. The city has signed people up for what it calls an elite squad of rat fighters, named \" NYC rat pack.\u201d",
      "It's an uphill battle.",
      "\u201cAs our cities warm, urbanize and (increase in) density, we create more resources for rats which could result in further increases in numbers,\u201d Simon Fraser University health and rat scientist Kaylee Byers said in an email.",
      "We can fight them better, but in the end people \u201cneed to coexist with wildlife in urban environments, even with rats,\u201d University of Michigan conservation scientist Neil Carter said.",
      "\u201cZero rats is impossible,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut I think an expectation that we need to live with the number of rats that we're seeing in many of these cities is also an unhealthy perspective on this problem.\u201d",

      "For 2024-2025, the U.S. is WHO\u2019s biggest donor by far, putting in an estimated $988 million, roughly 14% of WHO\u2019s $6.9 billion budget.",

      "A new memo says the Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments, according to a new memo.",
      "The directive signed this week eliminates a rarely used Biden administration policy enacted in October 2022, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and more states began to impose increased abortion restrictions.",
      "Signed on Wednesday by Jeffrey Register, the director of the Pentagon's human resources department, the memo simply shows red lines crossing out the previous regulation and offers no other guidance.",
      "Asked if service members would still be allowed time off to travel at their own expense, the department had no immediate answer.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the policy change \u201cshameful.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur service members go wherever they need to in order to bravely serve our country \u2014 and because President Trump\u2019s extremist Supreme Court overturned Roe, where they and their families are stationed quite literally dictates their access to critical reproductive care,\u201d Warren said in a statement. \u201cNow, Trump is turning his back on our servicemembers \u2014 and our servicewomen in particular \u2014 to score political points. It\u2019s shameful, and will only make our troops and our nation less safe.\u201d",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin instituted the policy in October 2022 to ensure that troops who were assigned to states where abortions or other types of health care such as IVF treatment were no longer provided could still access those services.",
      "The Defense Department on Friday was unable to say how many times the reimbursement policy was used, or the costs. But last March, officials said it had been used by service members or their dependents just 12 times from June to December 2023. And the total cost was roughly $40,000 to cover transportation, lodging and meals.",
      "The policy did not cover the cost of abortions, and it\u2019s not clear how many of the 12 trips were for abortions or other type of reproductive health care, such as IVF treatment. That specific medical information is protected by health privacy law.",
      "In his memo at the time, Austin said service members and their families were worried they may not get equal access to health care, including abortions. And he noted that service members who often must move for various missions or training would be forced to travel farther, take more time off work and pay more to access reproductive health care.",
      "The problem, Austin said, would create extraordinary hardship and \"interfere with our ability to recruit, retain, and maintain the readiness of a highly qualified force.\u201d",

That care includes in vitro fertilization and other pregnancy aids that also may not be accessible close by.",

      "A New York doctor has been indicted by a Lousiana grand jury for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "Carpenter did not immediately return a message.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we\u2019ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women\u2019s rights,\u201d the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s indictment could be the first direct test of New York\u2019s shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cWe always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn\u2019t the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That\u2019s why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They\u2019re also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed."

      "Political opponents of Tunisia's populist president are facing lengthy prison sentences after a court found them guilty of undermining state security",
      "A judge in Tunisia handed down lengthy sentences to prominent politicians and at least one leading journalist in a move criticized by a media union and leading opposition parties as the latest move targeting critics of President Kais Saied.",
      "Among those sentenced Wednesday include 83-year-old Rached Ghannouchi, the country\u2019s most prominent opposition leader, who has been behind bars for nearly two years.",
      "Ghannouchi, the co-founder of the Islamist movement Ennahda and Tunisia\u2019s former Assembly Speaker, was sentenced to an additional 22 years in prison for undermining state security. He boycotted the proceedings against him.",
      "Ennahda condemned the trial as politically motivated and said the prosecutions were \u201caimed at revenge, violating basic human rights and freedoms, undermining the rule of law and blatantly politicizing the judiciary.\u201d",
      "The National Salvation Front, a coalition of opposition parties that includes Ennahda, said in a statement that the sentences issued against bloggers, politicians and former government officials totaled more than 760 years and marked \u201cone of the darkest periods\u201d for the country\u2019s judicial branch, which has seen judges dismissed and power wrested from it by Saied's executive branch.",
      "\u201cThis particular chamber is becoming a specialized tool for issuing harsh sentences against politicians,\u201d said one of its leaders, Ahmed Nejib Chebbi.",
      "The charges stem from a 2019 case against a media company that provided services for Ennahda during that year\u2019s presidential elections. Those involved are accused of defamation, spreading falsehoods, money laundering, undermining state security and illegally accepting funds from abroad.",
      "Human rights groups have criticized such cases as a way to target Saied\u2019s opponents. Saied won a second term last October in a landslide election while his leading opponents, including Ghannouchi, languished in prison.",
      "\u201cThese rulings bring Tunisia back to a period the people sought to leave behind through their revolution,\u201d an Ennahda statement on Thursday said, referring to the 2011 ouster of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the first Arab dictator toppled as part of the Arab Spring uprising that swept the region that year.",
      "In the years that followed, the North African nation was seen as a success story for its transition to democracy, rewriting its constitution and winning a Nobel Peace Prize for political compromise. But signs of authoritarianism have re-emerged since Saied took power in 2019.",
      "Throughout his tenure, Saied has suspended parliament, rewritten the constitution to consolidate his power and arrested politicians, activists and journalists who criticized him.",

      "Journalist Chadha Haj Mubarak was sentenced to five years in prison as part of the same case, the National Syndicate of Tunisian Journalists said. The union called for her immediate release and in a statement denounced the court\u2019s lack of respect for press freedoms. In a statement Mubarak\u2019s attorney, Souhail Medimegh, said his client was being charged purely for her journalism.",

      "On Feb. 6 1840, representatives of the British Crown and 500 M\u0101ori tribal leaders signed a treaty at Waitangi, in New Zealand's far north, agreeing to the terms of their relationship.",
      "In modern times, annual events attended by lawmakers and Indigenous leaders at the treaty grounds have allowed the groups to speak face to face, even at times of racial discord.",
      "It has also supplied a litmus test for governments and M\u0101ori about the state of the treaty partnership \u2014 and sometimes prompts scenes of protest and conciliation. This year, the mood was reflected in a sermon at Waitangi's annual church service Thursday.",
      "\u201cTo renegotiate the terms of a marriage usually requires both spouses,\u201d Te Aroha Rountree of the Methodist church said. \u201cIt seems our spouse, the Crown, has filed for divorce.\"",
      "The bitterness centers on a proposed law which has become a flashpoint at a critical moment in the conversation about how New Zealand should honor its pledges to M\u0101ori when the country was colonized.",
      "The Treaty of Waitangi was drafted in two versions -\u2013 one in English and the other in M\u0101ori. But the documents dramatically differed \u2014 the M\u0101ori version promised Indigenous sovereignty \u2014 and the Crown soon began to breach both.",
      "It resulted in the near loss of the Indigenous language and deprivation for M\u0101ori on almost every metric.",
      "Over the past five decades, tribes have painstakingly clawed back the treaty's promises \u2014 which are constructed through legal judgements and billion-dollar settlements with government that return stolen land and other resources to their original owners.",
      "A minor libertarian political party helped Luxon's government to power in 2023 on a platform of redefining the way the treaty's principles are understood by rigidly interpreting them in law to ensure M\u0101ori are not unduly favored. Detractors say the bill would dramatically reverse M\u0101ori rights in a country that has in recent years started to embrace them.",
      "The bill's architect, David Seymour, met with protests at Waitangi marae \u2014 a M\u0101ori meeting house \u2014 during speeches by political leaders on Wednesday, as he made a fresh pitch for the law. The measures are widely derided and prompted tens of thousands of people to march on Parliament in Wellington last November.",
      "As Seymour \u2014 who is M\u0101ori \u2014 spoke, women stood as one and silently turned their backs to him. Lengthy portions of his speech were rendered inaudible as demonstrators twice approached him and quietly removed both his microphone and its stand.",
      "Those scenes perhaps explained why Luxon, the prime minister, spent the day far from Waitangi, attending commemorations on the South Island at Onuku Marae, where southern chiefs signed the Treaty months after tribes in the north.",
      "There, he was optimistic about a path through the current animus. Seymour's treaty bill is not expected to pass and Luxon opposes it \u2014 although he agreed to usher it through a first vote as part of the deal with Seymour's party that made him prime minister.",
      "\u201cLooking ahead, the ability to resolve differences and build bridges will be at the heart of New Zealand\u2019s success,\u201d Luxon said. \u201cWe\u2019ve demonstrated time and time again that we can confront tension, heal past grievances, and move forward, something many other countries around the world have failed to achieve.\u201d",
      "In response, Justin Tipa \u2014 chair of Ng\u0101i Tahu, the hosting tribe \u2014 told Luxon that the time since his ascent to power had signaled \u201ca dramatic shift in the cultural and political landscape\u201d of New Zealand.",
      "\u201cThe machinations of modern party politics threaten to corrupt the dignity of our nation's complex and contingent history, our identity,\u201d he added.",
      "At Waitangi, other M\u0101ori leaders and some of his political opponents accused Luxon of hiding. But the prime minister insisted that he always intended to spend each Waitangi Day in a different spot \u2014 and that he was not the first leader to do so.",
      "Most occasions when leaders have stayed away from Waitangi have punctuated tense moments in the Crown-M\u0101ori relationship. Some, like Seymour, have traveled there anyway \u2014 and faced vehement grievances about treaty breaches.",
      "From M\u0101ori wearing black armbands in mourning for stolen land, to a protester throwing a wet t-shirt at Queen Elizabeth II in 1990, Waitangi has often reflected rifts in race relations.",
      "Protests have at times been unconventional. In a famous 2016 episode, a cabinet minister was struck in the face with a sex toy lobbed by a demonstrator \u2014 who was arrested but released without charge."

      "The nighttime attack on the Primorsko-Akhtarsk airfield in Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region started a fire, the General Staff wrote on Facebook. The facility houses and fires drones and maintains aircraft used to attack Ukraine\u2019s Kherson and Zaporizhzhia border region.",

      "MOSUL, Iraq -- For over 850 years, the leaning minaret of the Great Mosque of al-Nuri stood as an iconic landmark in the Iraqi city of Mosul until it was destroyed by the Islamic State group in 2017.",
      "Nearly eight years after IS militants were driven out of the city, the minaret has been rebuilt as part of a massive internationally-funded reconstruction project in the historic city.",
      "Saad Muhammed Jarjees, who lives in Mosul\u2019s Old City, remembered how he used to look at the Al-Hadbaa Minaret from the window of his house every day \u2014 and how his heart sank when it fell.",
      "\u201cDuring the Islamic State occupation, I would look at it every morning and see their flag flying on top,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe longed for the day that flag would come down \u2014 it would mean we were liberated.\"",
      "\u201cThen one morning, we woke up to find the entire minaret gone,\u201d he said.",
      "UNESCO, the U.N.\u2019s scientific, educational and cultural organization, worked alongside Iraqi heritage and Sunni religious authorities to reconstruct the minaret using traditional techniques and materials salvaged from the rubble.",
      "For residents of Mosul, the restoration is deeply personal.",
      "\u201cThis mosque is considered the identity of Mosul\u2019s people,\u201d said Mohammed Khalil Al-Assaf, an imam in the city. \u201cWhen we came here today to see the Al-Hadbaa Minaret, we were reminded of beautiful past memories in this holy mosque.\u201d",
      "An official reopening of the minaret is expected to take place in the coming weeks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in attendance.",
      "\u201cThe Al-Hadbaa Minaret is one of the most symbolic sites for the people of Mosul, and today this symbol is completely brought back to life,\u201d said Ruwaid Allayla, Director of the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage.",

      "The team also needed to conduct detailed engineering and historical studies to design a site that would preserve the essence of the original, he said.",
      "On a visit to the city on Wednesday, UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay toured the minaret and the al-Nuri Mosque and other restored sites including the al-Hadbaa Minaret and the al-Tahira and al-Sa'aa churches.",
      "\u201cThis intervention in a post-conflict environment was unprecedented in its complexity,\u201d she said. \u201c80% of the Old City had been destroyed. When our first team arrived on-site in 2018, they were faced with a field of ruins.\u201d",
      "UNESCO mobilized $115 million for the reconstruction project, with large shares coming from the United Arab Emirates and the European Union, Azoulay said.",
      "The reconstruction push has also aimed to restore the city's Christian sites. In 2003, Mosul's Christian population stood at around 50,000. Many of them fled after IS seized control of Mosul in 2014.",
      "Today, less than 20 Christian families remain as permanent residents in the city. Others who fled to Irbil and other surrounding areas have not returned to their homes in Mosul but commute there for church on Sundays.",
      "At al-Tahira Church, which was also restored, Mar Benedictus Younan Hanno, Archbishop of Mosul for Syriac Catholics, said the reconstruction is about more than just buildings.",
      "\u201cThe main goal of rebuilding churches today is to revive the history that our ancestors lived,\u201d Hanno said. \u201cWhen Mosul Christians come to this church, they remember the place where they got educated and baptized, and the place where they prayed. This could possibly give them an incentive to return.\u201d",
      "Azoulay said that the sound of church bells ringing and church choirs singing in Mosul again sends a powerful message.",
      "\u201cIt sends the message that the city is returning to its true identity, which is a plural identity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important sign of hope that this church was rebuilt by Iraqi people, mostly Muslims, who are happy to restore it for this community.\"",
      "UNESCO\u2019s experience in Mosul will shape its approach to restoring other cultural sites in war-torn areas -- including neighboring Syria, which is now starting to emerge from nearly 14 years of civil war after the fall of former President Bashar Assad.",
      "\u201cThis initiative is also a legacy for UNESCO,\u201d Azoulay said. \u201cOur organization has acquired new expertise in post-conflict situations that it will be able to replicate in other crisis situations.\u201d",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- An ambush by a \u201cgroup of criminals\u201d killed at least 10 Nigerien soldiers near the country\u2019s border with Burkina Faso this week, Niger\u2019s ruling military junta said.",
      "An intervention unit was sent to the west of the country on Monday to catch criminals stealing cattle in Takzat, a village in western Niger, according to a military statement said broadcast on Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cIt was during the operation that a group of criminals ambushed the detachment of the internal security forces which resulted in the loss of 10 of our soldiers,\u201d it said. It did not specify who the criminals were.",
      "The attackers managed to flee, but the military caught and neutralized 15 \u201cterrorists\u201d on Tuesday, the statement added.",
      "Niger, along with its neighbors Burkina Faso and Mali, has for over a decade battled an insurgency fought by jihadi groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.",
      "Following military coups in all three nations in recent years, the ruling juntas have expelled French forces and turned to Russia\u2019s mercenary units for security assistance. The three countries vowed to strengthen their cooperation by establishing a new security alliance, the Alliance of Sahel States.",
      "But the security situation in the Sahel, a vast region on the fringes of the Sahara Desert, has significantly worsened since the juntas took power, analysts say, with a record number of attacks and civilians killed both by Islamic militants and government forces.",

    "summary": "Israel says it has begun preparations for the departure of large numbers of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip in line with President Donald Trump&rsquo;s plan for the territory",
    "story": [
      "Israel says it has begun preparations for the departure of large numbers of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip in line with President Donald Trump\u2019s plan for the territory",
      "CAIRO -- Israel said on Thursday it has begun preparations for the departure of large numbers of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip in line with President Donald Trump's plan for the territory. Officials meanwhile said Egypt has launched an diplomatic blitz behind the scenes to try and head off the plan.",
      "The Trump administration has already dialed back aspects of the proposal after it was widely rejected internationally, saying the relocation of Palestinians would be temporary. U.S. officials have provided few details about how or when the plan would be carried out.",
      "In a social media post on Thursday, Trump said Israel would turn Gaza over to the United States after the war and that no U.S. soldiers would be needed for his plan to redevelop it.",
      "The Palestinians have vehemently rejected Trump's proposal, fearing that Israel would never allow refugees to return. Egypt has warned that an expulsion of Palestinians would destabilize the region and undermine its peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of stability and American influence for decades.",
      "Saudi Arabia, another key U.S. ally, has also rejected any mass transfer of Palestinians and says it will not normalize relations with Israel \u2014 a key goal of the Trump administration \u2014 without the creation of a Palestinian state that includes Gaza.",
      "Trump and Israeli officials have depicted the proposed relocation from war-ravaged Gaza as voluntary, but the Palestinians have universally expressed their determination to remain in their homeland.",
      "Trump and Israeli officials have not said how they would respond if Palestinians refuse to leave. But Human Rights Watch and other groups say the plan, if implemented, would amount to \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d the forcible relocation of the civilian population of an ethnic group from a geographic area.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he has ordered the military to make preparations to facilitate the emigration of large numbers of Palestinians from Gaza through land crossings as well as \u201cspecial arrangements for exit by sea and air.\u201d",
      "There were no immediate signs of such preparations on the ground.",
      "Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has not publicly responded to Trump's stunning proposal that most of Gaza's population of 2.3 million Palestinians be relocated and the United States take charge of rebuilding the territory. Israel's 15-month campaign against the militant Hamas group had reduced large parts of Gaza to rubble before a fragile ceasefire took hold last month.",
      "But Egyptian officials, speaking Wednesday on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks, said Cairo has made clear to the Trump administration and Israel that it will resist any such proposal, and that the peace deal with Israel \u2014 which has stood for nearly half a century \u2014 is at risk.",
      "One official said the message has been delivered to the Pentagon, the State Department and members of the U.S. Congress. A second official said it has also been conveyed to Israel and its Western European allies, including Britain, France and Germany.",
      "A Western diplomat in Cairo, also speaking anonymously because the discussions have not been made public, confirmed receiving the message from Egypt through multiple channels. The diplomat said Egypt was very serious and viewed the plan as a threat to its national security.",
      "The diplomat said Egypt rejected similar proposals from the Biden administration and European countries early in the war, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel. The earlier proposals were broached privately, while Trump announced his plan at a White House press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "Trump said he wanted to \u201cpermanently\u201d resettle most of Gaza's population in other countries and for the United States to take charge of clearing debris and rebuilding Gaza as a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East\" for all people. He did not rule out the deployment of U.S. troops there.",
      "U.S. officials later appeared to walk it back, saying the relocation of Palestinians would be temporary and that Trump had not committed to putting American boots on the ground or spending American tax dollars in Gaza.",
      "The Egyptian officials said their government does not believe the Palestinians need to be relocated for reconstruction to proceed and is committed to the creation of a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Israel's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood and has said it will maintain open-ended security control over both Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized by most of the international community and considers the entire city its capital.",
      "Last week, Egypt hosted a meeting of top diplomats from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 which was the driving force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords Trump brokered with Israel. All five Arab nations rejected the transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza or the West Bank.",
      "In an editorial on Thursday, Egypt\u2019s main state-run daily, Al-Ahram, warned that \u201cthe Arab countries' independence, their peoples\u2019 unity and their territorial integrity are under grave threat.\u201d",

      "TEHRAN, Iran -- TEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 Iran has inaugurated its first drone-carrier warship, saying the vessel is capable of operating in oceans far from its mainland, the official IRNA news agency reported Thursday.",
      "The report said the vessel, manned by the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard\u2019s navy, can carry several squadrons of drones as well as helicopters and cruise missiles. Named Shahid Bagheri, it's capable of launching cruise missiles, IRNA said.",
      "With a 180-meter-long runway for drones, the vessel can travel up to 22,000 nautical miles without needing to refuel in ports. The report said it was converted from a commercial ship and would increase Iran\u2019s power of deterrence.",
      "Footage broadcast by state TV on the inauguration showed at least four helicopters and three drones on the warship's runway.",
      "Chief of the Guard, Gen. Hossein Salami, said at the ceremony that the warship can travel \u201cindependently\u201d in seas for up to one year.",
      "Iran needs to increase its deterrence capacity to prevent war, he said, stressing that Iran doesn't wish to wage war with any country.",

      "Chief of the Guard\u2019s navy Adm. Ali Reza Tangsiri said it took more than two years to build the warship from the commercial vessel.",
      "The report said the ship also has a hospital and facilities such as a gym for its crew.",
      "Iran has long vowed to boost its presence on seas worldwide. Since 1992, Iran began a military self-sufficiency plan under which it claims the production of its own submarines, jet fighters and military tanks."

      "OREBRO, Sweden -- The shooter who earlier this week killed 10 people in Sweden\u2019s worst mass shooting was connected to the adult education center where he opened fire with at least one rifle-like weapon, law enforcement officials said Thursday.",
      "Authorities said the gunman, who has not yet been officially identified, may have attended school there before Tuesday's violence on the school campus west of Stockholm. The shooter was later found dead with three guns, 10 empty magazines and a large amount of unused ammunition next to his body, officials told a news conference.",
      "It was not clear how he died but officials said officers did not return his gunfire.",
      "The school, Campus Risbergska, offers primary and secondary educational classes for adults age 20 and older, Swedish-language classes for immigrants, vocational training, and programs for people with intellectual disabilities. It is on the outskirts of Orebro, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Stockholm.",
      "Some 130 officers arrived Tuesday after alarms summoned them to the school to find chaos across the campus. They described the scene as an \u201cinferno\u201d and believe the gunman turned his weapon toward them as they entered the building.",
      "\"Dead people, injured people, screams and smoke,\" local police chief Lars Wir\u00e9n said during the news conference. \u201cMany people running inside and outside the premises.\u201d",
      "Officers found at least five people, all over age 18 with serious gunshot wounds. Two of them remained in intensive care Thursday in serious but stable condition. The other three were in stable condition after surgery.",
      "A sixth person was treated for minor injuries.",
      "Police were forced to search the large school \u2014 17,000 square meters (182,986 square feet) \u2014 to ensure there were no other casualties.",
      "Investigators had not uncovered a definitive motive behind the bloodshed by Thursday. Police said there were no warnings beforehand, and they believe the perpetrator acted alone. Authorities said there were no suspected connections to terrorism at this point.",
      "In Orebro, a town of 160,000 that's considered Sweden's seventh-largest municipality, Thursday brought more sadness but still few answers.",
      "\u201cIt has been two days of shock and grief,\u201d John Johansson, chairman of the town's municipal board, told The Associated Press. \"We are still asking questions of why, still wondering what has happened. The outpouring of grief and togetherness has been enormous.\u201d",
      "King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, as well as Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, visited Orebro on Wednesday and attended a memorial service. The Swedish Football Association pledged to begin its future international matches with a moment of silence.",
      "Mourners elsewhere in the the Scandinavian nation, where gun violence at schools is very rare, struggled to process the thought of mass violence in their own country.",
      "\"\u201cThis is not a Swedish problem, it\u2019s a problem that we have seen throughout the world,\u201d Johansson said.",
      "The shooting's online presence has prompted friends of Orebro resident Petter Jorman, a 60-year-old father whose son previously attended the school, to call and text him asking \u201chow are you? Are you OK? I know you live close.\u201d",
      "The shooting started Tuesday afternoon, after many students had gone home following a national exam. Survivors scrambled for cover as shots rang out, sheltering behind or under whatever they could find to escape the gunman and the gore. One woman with children feared she might never see them again, while another used her friend\u2019s shawl to staunch the bleeding of a man who\u2019d been shot in the shoulder.",
      "\u201cThose were the worst hours of my life. I did not know if I would get shot there and then, or in 10 minutes. You simply waited,\u201d Hellen Werme, 35, told the Expressen newspaper.",
      "While gun violence at schools is very rare in Sweden, people were wounded or killed with other weapons such as knives or axes in several incidents in recent years.",
      "Authorities said the shooter had licenses for four weapons, three of which were found next to his body. Police have seized the fourth.",
      "In order to possess a firearm legally, applicants must obtain a weapon license and demonstrate that it will be used for an acceptable purpose, such as hunting or target shooting, and not be misused. Applicants must also submit previously obtained hunting or target shooting certificates. Hunting certificates require people to pass a training course, while target shooters must be certified as active and experienced members of clubs.",
      "In Sweden, a country of roughly 10.5 million people, there were just over 660,000 registered gun owners at the beginning of 2024, according to the Swedish news agency TT. Those registered owners had some 2 million guns, objects that are considered firearms and weapon parts that require a permit.",
      "TT reported that 1.6 million of those guns are registered for hunting, and another 176,000 for target-shooting.",
      "All weapons must be stored in secure cabinets approved by the police. Applications for fully automatic weapons or one-handed weapons are only granted for exceptional reasons, and such permits are generally time-limited.",
      "Permits are revoked if the weapon is modified to be substantially different from its original function.",

      "LONDON -- The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third time in six months later Thursday, even though inflation remains above its target.",
      "Most economists think the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee will lower the bank's main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.50%, taking it to its lowest level since mid-2023. The base rate helps dictate how expensive it is for individuals to take out a mortgage or a loan, while also influencing the returns offered by banks on savings.",
      "Of particular interest to financial markets is what the bank's accompanying economic forecasts show and the tone of Gov. Andrew Bailey in his ensuing press briefing.",
      "\u201cUntil now, the bank has cut at alternate meetings, but a stagnating economy and declining employment argue for more urgent action,\u201d said Andrew Wishart, senior U.K. economist at Berenberg Bank.",
      "The rate-setting panel is tasked with ensuring that inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, hits a 2% target over the coming couple years or so.",
      "Though inflation is standing at 2.5% and expected to rise in coming months, partly as a result of business tax increases from the new Labour government, most economists think it will then trend lower towards the target, hence the panel's ability to cut.",
      "Official figures earlier this month showed a surprise decline in the inflation rate to 2.5% in the year to December, largely as a result of easing price pressures in the services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the U.K. economy.",
      "Another potential reason for rate-setters to cut borrowing rates is that economic growth in the U.K. has stagnated, which will likely put downward pressure on inflation.",
      "Inflation is way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic."

      "Amazon-owned Whole Foods is asking the National Labor Relations Board to set aside the results of a union election that led to a labor win",
      "Amazon-owned Whole Foods is asking the National Labor Relations Board to set aside the results of a union election in which the first group of the company\u2019s employees voted in favor of collective bargaining.",
      "In a filing submitted to the agency this week, attorneys for Whole Foods Market argued the union involved with the election, held last week at a store in Philadelphia, interfered in the process by promising employees a 30% wage increase if they unionized and providing free transportation to them the day of the vote.",
      "The company also accused The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union \u2013 which worked to unionize workers through a local chapter \u2013 of intimidating employees who supported Whole Foods. The company did not provide specific details on its allegations, which the union disputes.",
      "Pro-union workers prevailed last week after 130 employees in the store \u2013 or about 57% of the ballots cast \u2013 voted in favor of organizing. The election results still need be certified by a regional director of the NLRB, which Whole Foods says can't lawfully be done since the agency currently does not have a third board member in Washington. Gynne A. Wilcox, one of the agency's board members, was fired last week by the Trump administration.",
      "In a statement, UFCW Local 1776, the local union that pulled off the labor win, called the company\u2019s allegations baseless. It also said the objections filed by Whole Foods was a legal maneuvering done to delay the bargaining process.",
      "\u201cWe fully expected Whole Foods to try to stall this process,\" said Wendell Young IV, the president of the local union. \"Amazon has a well-documented history of using baseless objections to undermine the rights of workers seeking representation, and this case is no different.\u201d",
      "In its objection to the election, the upscale grocery chain also accused the NLRB of tainting the process by restraining the company from communicating its views on unionization to employees through required meetings held during work hours.",
      "In November, the agency\u2019s board had issued a decision that found these meetings \u2013 commonly known as captive audience meetings \u2013 were unlawful because they forced employees to attend gatherings that they may otherwise choose to skip. Companies typically use these meetings to deter employees from unionizing.",
      "The board said employers may still hold meetings about unions for their workers. But they must make attendance voluntary with no adverse consequences for employees who fail to show up.",
      "The union election in Philadelphia marked the first successful entry of organized labor into Amazon\u2019s grocery business, which includes Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and the Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion, has tried to fend off organizing efforts by delivery drivers and warehouse workers.",

      "In a Wednesday memo to employees, published in a securities filing, Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach said the layoffs were necessary for ongoing growth efforts at the company \u2014 including a particular focus on artificial intelligence investments.",
      "\u201cAs we start our new fiscal year, we\u2019re at a pivotal moment,\u201d Eschenbach wrote. \u201cCompanies everywhere are reimagining how work gets done, and the increasing demand for AI has the potential to drive a new era of growth for Workday.\u201d",

      "The maker of human resources software also disclosed that it expects to exit certain office space, but didn't specify a timeline or which locations may be impacted. Still, Eschenbach's memo notes that the restructuring will work to expand Workday's global reach by \u201cinvesting in strategic locations.\u201d",
      "And despite the current layoffs, the maker of human resources software says that it still expects to continue hiring in certain locations and positions over the next year.",
      "Workday estimates that it will incur between $230 million and $270 million in charges related to the restructuring plan \u2014 primarily in severance payments, employee benefits and other related costs. All employees laid off in the U.S. will be offered a minimum of 12 weeks of pay, with additional weeks based on tenure, Eschenbach said Wednesday, adding that affected workers in other countries will be offered packages based on local standards.",
      "The job cuts at Workday arrive as layoffs continue across the tech sector \u2014 including from big names like Intel, Cisco and Apple over the past year \u2014 amid a broader wave of industry consolidation.

      "The three Baltic countries, which together share a 1,633-kilometer (1,015-mile) -long border with Russia and Belarus, officially informed Moscow and Minsk of the disconnection plan in July.

      "Despite the advance notice, the Baltic nations are still on watch for a possible response from their former Soviet partners.",
      "\u201cThe risk of cyberattacks remains substantial,\u201d Litgrid said last week, adding that continued vigilance, collaboration, defensive steps and \u201crobust\u201d cybersecurity measures were needed to effectively mitigate potential threats.",

      "After the disconnection plans were announced, propaganda campaigns cropped up on social media and in printed leaflets in city streets that issued fake-news warnings about blackouts, severe energy shortages and sky-high energy bills for consumers.",
      "\u201cWe heard those rumors, but we are used to such things already\u201d said Jolanta Karavaitien\u0117, a retired teacher, in central Vilnius. \u201dOf course we must disconnect from them. Given the geopolitical situation, I see no reason for us to be there (in the Russian grid).\u201d",

      "Next-door neighbors lost their near-identical homes in a California wildfire, but how they are navigating rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery, a stark reflection of the nation\u2019s growing home insurance crisis",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Before a wildfire ravaged their street in northwest Altadena, Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson lived next door to each other in nearly identical houses.",
      "\u201cI chose an old home in an old neighborhood because it has soul,\u201d said Hamlin, a 51-year-old single mom with a teenage boy, who bought her 1,500-square-foot home 10 years ago.",
      "Today, gone are their charming English-style cottages built in 1925 with the welcoming porches and Palladian windows. Amid the rubble and ash, little is left of their historic neighborhood.",
      "In the weeks since the Eaton wildfire took their homes, Hamlin and Wilson have been stumbling through the layers of business, bureaucracy and emotional trauma of surviving a natural disaster, with their sights firmly set on rebuilding.",
      "How they\u2019ll navigate rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery that reveals the nation\u2019s growing home insurance crisis. Her insurance has already paid out nearly a million dollars and she is searching for contractors. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "\u201cIt changes the whole trajectory to your life,\u201d said Wilson, 44, who bought his house five years ago with his wife, who is six months pregnant with their first child.",
      "Hamlin\u2019s home was privately covered by Mercury Insurance, but Wilson was forced onto the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state\u2019s bare-bones insurance program \u2014 when SafeCo declined to renew his policy last May. The FAIR Plan insures people who can\u2019t get private coverage but need insurance as a condition of their mortgage.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters become more frequent due to climate change, many property owners find themselves struggling to find or afford private insurance. The issue is particularly acute in California, where some major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies altogether or are refusing to renew existing ones.",
      "State officials recently started rolling out new regulations to entice insurers to stay in California, with the hope of getting as many homeowners as possible off the FAIR Plan.",
      "FAIR, with its high premiums and basic coverage, was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders find a more permanent option. Yet the number of FAIR Plan residential policies more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies last year.",
      "For Wilson and Hamlin, their parallel rebuilding journeys serve as a cautionary tale. Wilson paid nearly 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, for less than half the coverage.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why a lot of people call it 'The Unfair Plan.\u2019\" said Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders.",
      "SafeCo's parent company Liberty Mutual said in a statement that it couldn't comment on any individual policies but acknowledged \u201cdifficult but purposeful business decisions\u201d in California.",
      "Mercury didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurance companies, said California is fortunate to have the FAIR Plan, which is required to accept everyone. Ruiz said outcomes would be even worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said California is working to make sure all claims are paid. He said in a statement that his office is working to get homeowners off the FAIR Plan and back to traditional more comprehensive insurance coverage.",
      "A FAIR Plan spokesperson declined to comment on Wilson\u2019s case, and noted that it\u2019s difficult to compare policies and coverage.",
      "Thousands of people lost their homes in the Eaton and nearby Palisades fires, which were among the most destructive in California history.",
      "The FAIR Plan said it expanded staffing to meet the surging demand and has a funding mechanism in place to pay all covered claims. State data shows more than 31,000 wildfire-related claims had been filed as of last week, including roughly 4,400 claims under the FAIR Plan.",
      "Hamlin had standard comprehensive home insurance, with an annual policy premium of $1,264 at the time of the fire. She can receive up to $1.5 million to replace her home, other structures and personal property, including up to $303,000 for living expenses while displaced. Her policy further entitles her to coverage that could add more than $200,000 to help her rebuild.",
      "Wilson, meanwhile, pays a $2,000 premium for the FAIR Plan that sets his maximum payout at $686,000, including $100,000 for living expenses while displaced.",
      "Wilson also had to buy \u201cwrap-around insurance\u201d for $1,500 a year for issues the FAIR Plan doesn\u2019t cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects. That supplemental plan doesn\u2019t cover fire damage.",
      "Hamlin said Mercury's support has been exceptional, immediately sending her money and helping with next steps such as finding housing and getting contractor quotes. Within days, the company wired her tens of thousands of dollars to get started while the process fell into place.",
      "\u201cBeing able to rest at night and wake up and deal with everything else is really important,\u201d Hamlin said.",
      "Meanwhile, Wilson has struggled to even talk to a FAIR Plan representative. There was zero communication in the first two weeks, contact information was listed incorrectly, phone numbers had no voicemail and emails bounced back.",
      "\u201cHalf the time, I feel like I\u2019m doing something wrong,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "After The Associated Press reached out for comment, Insurance Department spokesperson Michael Soller said a representative would contact Wilson directly.",
      "Wilson said he feels haunted by his choices. He thought he had bought property in a low-risk area, and had avoided looking for homes in another neighborhood further north after hearing that people there had been dropped by their insurers.",
      "Hamlin, too, was aware of the fire risks when she moved in. She previously lived in Pasadena and was surprised that State Farm, her then-insurance company, would not offer her coverage in Altadena. She chose Mercury because it was the cheapest option, and was considering pursuing even more robust coverage.",
      "\u201cI could have been dropped when Chris was dropped. Any of us could be at any time. It\u2019s just luck, really. It\u2019s nothing I did or didn\u2019t do,\u201d Hamlin said, stunned by the comparison. \u201cI had the same risk factors as everyone else.\u201d",
      "Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley, said the seemingly random nature of who gets dropped and when has much to do with insurance companies' complicated risk models.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all trying to manage their exposure,\u201d Collier said. \u201cIf you think about wildfires, you don\u2019t want concentrated exposure.\u201d",
      "Wilson said SafeCo requested an inspection of his property before deciding not to renew his policy. Panicked, he tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with them, offering to clear brushes, trim trees near the roof, and other wildfire mitigation efforts.",
      "Wilson shopped around aggressively with his insurance agent but to no avail, and resigned himself to the FAIR Plan, assuming he would eventually find private insurance again.",
      "There was another catch: Wilson said he couldn\u2019t get comprehensive replacement cost coverage on the FAIR Plan because his roof was too old. Instead, he ended up with what is known as \u201cactual cash value\u201d coverage, which greatly limits the payout based on the physical depreciation of what was lost.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars and that\u2019s very, very painful,\u201d said Bach of United Policyholders.",
      "Citing rising fire risks and other problems, seven of the top 12 insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in California in 2023. State regulations give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing policies in high-risk areas, including consideration of climate change in premiums and passing the costs of reinsurance to consumers.",
      "But those are only short-term solutions, said Dave Jones, California's insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2018. He pointed to Florida, where officials have \u201cdone everything the insurers asked California to do\u201d but yielded little success.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re marching steadily towards an uninsurable future in the United States because we\u2019re not doing enough fast enough to address the underlying cause, which is climate change,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Unless governments take on the financial burden of serious mitigation efforts, the price of California\u2019s fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, Collier of UC Berkeley said. That could be the underinsured \u2014 like Wilson \u2014 swallowing their personal losses, or all California homeowners collectively saddled with increased premiums, or both. State Farm, California\u2019s largest insurance company, this week urged the state to approve an emergency rate hike of 22% for homeowner policies starting in May after processing nearly 8,700 claims and paying out more than $1 billion to policyholders for the LA fires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of risk in the system and there\u2019s a big question of who is going to pay for this,\u201d Collier said.",
      "Wilson expects he\u2019ll have to take out loans to rebuild. He\u2019s considering joining a lawsuit against Southern California Edison that alleges the utility\u2019s equipment sparked the blaze, in hopes of receiving settlement money.",
      "But with a baby on the way, Wilson said he can\u2019t fathom living in limbo on the FAIR Plan forever, and he\u2019s thinking about leaving California if private insurance remains out of reach.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to be prepared to maybe lose everything again,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cStuck paying for an insurance that doesn\u2019t cover anything. You don\u2019t want to live in a risky area. You don\u2019t have the safety net.\u201d",

      "SEATTLE -- It\u2019s one thing to fix your home after something basic has gone wrong, but it\u2019s a different beast to rebuild and recover after a major natural disaster has destroyed multiple properties on your street, in your neighborhood or across the region.",
      "Don\u2019t wait until you\u2019re in crisis mode to figure out what to expect. It's important to understand your benefits and rights when it comes to home insurance in the event of a widespread emergency.",
      "Insurance is meant to cover what you lost, but that can mean two very different things.",
      "If you do nothing else, check your policy now to see if you have \u201creplacement cost value\u201d coverage. That\u2019s the comprehensive standard, which will grant you the amount of money needed to get a new replacement of what you lost in case of a major disaster like a wildfire.",
      "If you have \u201cactual cash value\u201d coverage, that means the dollar limits listed are only intended to cover the value of what you lost, which factors in depreciation at the time of the event.",
      "Amy Bach of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders says the two are apples and oranges in terms of payouts. She describes it this way: \u201cActual cash value is the Craigslist price. It\u2019s not the replacement cost price.\u201d",
      "From finding a new place to live to buying yourself clothes and toiletries, it\u2019s expensive to survive the immediate aftermath of an emergency, so get familiar with any state laws regulating insurance companies on advanced payments.",
      "For example, California, which has some of the strongest consumer protections in the nation, requires insurers to quickly pay out up to $250,000, or the equivalent of 30% of the policy\u2019s dwelling coverage limit, when a state of emergency has been declared and the home is known to be a total loss. This is considered an advanced payment, which doesn\u2019t require the homeowner to first itemize all their destroyed belongings or wait for an adjuster to access the site of the property.",
      "If you aren\u2019t able to connect with your insurer, look for emergency response centers in your community, which should provide state and federal troubleshooters to assist.

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 09:06:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Italy&rsquo;s justice minister has strongly defended the government&rsquo;s decision to free and repatriate a Libyan warlord wanted by the International Criminal Court",
    "story": [
      "Italy\u2019s justice minister has strongly defended the government\u2019s decision to free and repatriate a Libyan warlord wanted by the International Criminal Court",
      "ROME -- Italy\u2019s justice minister strongly defended the government's decision to repatriate a Libyan warlord wanted by the International Criminal Court, saying Wednesday that the court itself had made an \"immense mess\u201d of the case by issuing a contradictory and flawed arrest warrant.",
      "Justice Minister Carlo Nordio told the lower chamber of parliament that he was right to proceed carefully with the Jan. 18 warrant against Ossama Anjiem, also known as Ossama al-Masri, who is accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "He said that The Hague-based court later \u201ccorrected, or rather completely overturned the previous warrant\u201d by changing the timespan of al-Masri\u2019s alleged crimes.",
      "\u201cThe court itself detected them and tried to change them five days later, because it realized that an immense mess was made,\u201d he told the Chamber of Deputies.",
      "The Italian government has been under fire from the ICC, human rights groups and opposition lawmakers ever since it freed al-Masri from prison on Jan. 21 and sent him back to Libya aboard an Italian military aircraft. Al-Masri heads the Tripoli branch of the Reform and Rehabilitation Institution, a notorious network of detention centers run by the government-backed Special Defense Force.",
      "The ICC warrant available on the court's website accuses al-Masri of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Mitiga prison in Libya starting in 2015 that are punishable with life in prison. The ICC said he was accused of murder, torture, rape and sexual violence.",
      "Al-Masri was arrested in Turin on the ICC warrant on Jan. 19 at 9:30 a.m., the day after he arrived in the country from Germany to watch a soccer match. The Italian government has said Rome\u2019s court of appeals ordered him released Jan. 21 because of a technical problem in the way that the ICC warrant was transmitted, having initially bypassed the Italian justice ministry.",
      "Nordio repeated that argument Wednesday, saying that he only received an \u201cinformal email of a few lines\u201d from Interpol three hours after al-Masri was arrested.",
      "But he added that the text of the original Jan. 18 warrant itself was full of contradictions, specifically the timespan during which al-Masri allegedly committed his crimes. While the text of the warrant spoke of crimes allegedly occurring between 2015-2024, the conclusions referred to crimes allegedly committed from \u201c2011 onwards.\u201d",
      "\u201cAn irreconcilable contradiction emerges regarding an essential element of the arrestee\u2019s criminal conduct, regarding the time of the crime committed,\u201d Nordio said.",
      "When the court announced it was unsealing the warrant on Jan. 24, it said that it was issuing an updated warrant to \u201ccorrect certain typographical and clerical errors.\u201d The revised warrant speaks only of alleged crimes between 2015-2024.",
      "Human rights groups have blasted Italy\u2019s repatriation of al-Masri as a serious breach of its obligations as a founding member of the court. According to Article 89 of the Rome Statute, the 1998 treaty that gave birth to the ICC, member states must \u201ccomply with requests for arrest and surrender.\u201d",
      "And opposition lawmakers have seized on the case to attack Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni. They have demanded that Meloni herself brief parliament, and on Wednesday they held up signs saying \u201cMeloni the patriot at large\u201d in the chamber.",
      "Italy has close ties to the internationally recognized government in Tripoli, on whom it relies to patrol its coasts and prevent migrants from leaving. Opposition politicians have accused the government of essentially caving to the threat that Libyan militias might have unleashed boatloads of migrants had al-Masri been handed over to the ICC.",
      "Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, who also briefed Parliament on Wednesday, denied al-Masri was ever an interlocutor with the government on the migration issue. And he denied that Italy had received any threats in connection with his arrest.",
      "Opposition leader Elly Schlein of the Democratic Party blasted Nordio\u2019s presentation, saying that his legalistic arguments about the ICC warrant were misplaced and that he had no role to evaluate an arrest warrant from the court.",
      "\u201cMinister Nordio, you didn\u2019t speak to this chamber as a minister, but as the defense lawyer of a torturer,\u201d Schlein said.",
      "Nordio\u2019s attack on the ICC warrant is in line with the government\u2019s overall attempt to focus attention on the judiciary\u2019s role in the al-Masri saga.",
      "Last week, Rome\u2019s chief prosecutor informed Meloni, Nordio, Piatendosi and another government official that they were being investigated for allegedly favoring irregular migration by repatriating al-Masri. Meloni has spent days complaining about Italy's politicized judiciary, echoing a frequent line of attack taken by her onetime ally, the late former Premier Silvio Berlusconi.",
      "But Meloni has also acknowledged that national security issues came into play in the al-Masri case: In an X post on Jan. 29, Meloni framed the issue as a matter of defending Italy.",
      "\u201cWhen the security of the national and the interests of Italians are in play, there is no room for backing down,\u201d she wrote.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 08:37:54 -0500",
    "summary": "The Hawaii Supreme Court is scheduled to hear about insurance issues tying up a potential $4 billion Maui wild fire settlement",
    "story": [
      "The Hawaii Supreme Court is scheduled to hear about insurance issues tying up a potential $4 billion Maui wild fire settlement",
      "HONOLULU -- Hawaii's Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Thursday over insurance issues that are tying up a potential $4 billion settlement over Maui's catastrophic 2023 wildfire, the deadliest in the U.S. in more than a century.",
      "The massive inferno decimated the historic town of Lahaina, killing more than 100 people, destroying thousands of properties and causing an estimated $5.5 billion in damage. Soon afterward, attorneys began lodging hundreds of lawsuits.",
      "A settlement was announced last summer, but insurance companies held out, insisting that they should have the right to go after the defendants separately to recoup money paid out to policyholders.",
      "Here are things to know about the settlement and the issues that could thwart the deal:",
      "A few days before the one-year anniversary of the Aug. 8, 2023, fire, Gov. Josh Green announced that seven defendants accused of causing the tragedy had agreed to pay $4 billion to resolve claims by thousands of people.",
      "Attorneys representing the individual plaintiffs agreed to the deal amid fears that main defendant Hawaiian Electric, the power company blamed for sparking the blaze, could be on the brink of bankruptcy. Other defendants include the state, Maui County and Kamehameha Schools, the largest private landowner in Hawaii.",
      "Victims' attorneys acknowledged that $4 billion wasn't enough to make up for what was lost but said the deal was worth accepting, given Hawaiian Electric's limited assets.",
      "Attorneys for the victims asked Judge Peter Cahill to bar insurance companies from going after the defendants separately to recoup money \u2014 a requirement that was key to the settlement. Cahill agreed, saying insurers could seek reimbursement only from the $4 billion pool the defendants have already agreed to pay.",
      "That didn't sit well with a group of about 200 property and casualty insurers that remain holdouts to the settlement. So far they have paid more than $2.3 billion to people and businesses and expect to pay $1 billion more. They want to be able to pursue their own claims against the defendants.",
      "Cahill has asked the state high court questions about subrogation, or how insurance companies can go about recouping money.",
      "Among the issues before the court is whether state laws controlling health care insurance reimbursement also apply to casualty and property insurance in limiting companies' ability to pursue independent legal action against those held liable.",
      "It's not clear when the justices will issue a ruling.",
      "A last-minute deal between victims' lawyers last week averted a separate trial over how to split the $4 billion between individual plaintiffs and others covered by a class-action lawsuit. Some victims had been ready to take the witness stand, while others submitted pre-recorded testimony describing pain made all the more fresh by the recent destruction in Los Angeles.",
      "Common in the insurance industry, subrogation is a legal process that allows an insurance company to pursue a party that caused a covered loss. It's one way companies recover the amount of claims paid to policyholders.",
      "Insurance companies say subrogation is a way to offset costs associated with a catastrophic event so premiums won\u2019t have to go up. The process isn't for natural disasters such as hurricanes, but for when there is someone at fault.",
      "Hawaii's governor has previously denounced subrogation.",
      "When insurance companies collect huge profits and no disasters occur, they don't send refunds back to policyholders, Green noted in comments quoted in court filings. But when a tragedy does happen, they look to recoup their payments to the victims.",
      "\"It\u2019s fundamentally unfair, and they call it subrogation,\u201d he said.",
      "The insurance industry has been unfairly villainized as outsiders taking resources from the community while those responsible for the fires won\u2019t be held accountable, Vincent Raboteau, an attorney representing the insurers, told Cahill during a hearing last year.",
      "Insurance lawyers have said they want to hold the defendants accountable and aren\u2019t trying to get in the way of fire victims getting settlement money.",
      "Origin and cause investigations are \u201ctime-intensive and costly,\" lawyers said in a court brief of insurers who \u201cassume the burden of these investigations,\u201d and take on the risk of those costs.",
      "Insurers promptly paid claims, which are helping victims rebuild, the brief said: \u201cFor many wildfire victims, payment of claims by their insurer provided quick access to desperately needed funds.\u201d",
      "Not for a while.",
      "If the state Supreme Court agrees that an insurance company can sue defendants directly, \u201cthat would likely destroy the global settlement agreement,\u201d said Jacob Lowenthal, an attorney representing individual plaintiffs. The plaintiffs would go back to Cahill's courtroom to figure out trial dates for their lawsuits.",
      "If the justices rule the other way, the settlement could head toward finalization, putting in motion an administrative process for doling out money.",
      "It's possible that whichever side loses will seek review at the U.S. Supreme Court.",

    "story": [
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke with Elon Musk a day after U.S. President Donald Trump promised to cut the country's funding over a land expropriation law",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke with Donald Trump's \u201cinfluential\u201d billionaire adviser Elon Musk a day after the new U.S. president promised to cut funding for South Africa over a land expropriation law, Ramaphosa's spokesperson said Wednesday.",
      "Ramaphosa\u2019s conversation with Musk was \u201clogical,\u201d spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said, because the South African-born Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur has held previous investment-related discussions with Ramaphosa and is a Trump ally.",
      "The land law, which was signed by Ramaphosa last month, is contentious because it gives the government scope to expropriate land from private parties.",
      "Trump announced Sunday that he would stop financial assistance while the U.S. investigated why South Africa was \u201cconfiscating land\u201d from some people, without saying who. He told reporters wrongly that the South African government was taking away land and \u201cactually they\u2019re doing things that are perhaps far worse than that.\u201d Trump again didn\u2019t provide details.",
      "The South African government said Trump\u2019s announcement and related criticism of the country by Musk was full of \u201cmisinformation and distortions\u201d and the call to Musk was to set the record straight.",
      "Musk, who is leading the Trump administration\u2019s new Department of Government Efficiency, has long criticized the government in his homeland, a key U.S. trading partner in Africa, as being anti-white and has cast the law in question as a deliberate act to take land away from its white minority.",
      "He faces scrutiny in the U.S. for his control over parts of the federal government, but the South Africa issue also shows his influence on U.S. foreign policy.",
      "Should Trump follow through on his promise to cut South Africa\u2019s funding, it would stop nearly half a billion dollars a year in assistance, the vast majority of it for the world\u2019s biggest HIV/AIDS program.",
      "South Africa has the highest number of people living with HIV in the world at more than 8 million, with around 5.5 million on antiretroviral medication. The U.S. funds around 17% of South Africa's HIV program through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, and gave the country $440 million in assistance last year.",
      "The South African government said no land has been confiscated, and even groups in South Africa that have been critical of the new law said Trump was wrong in claiming any land had been taken away.",
      "\u201cWe will respond expeditiously to disinformation and mischaracterization of our laws as well as the general state of the country,\u201d Magwenya, Ramaphosa\u2019s spokesperson, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cWe were obviously perturbed by the substance of the announcement (by Trump) because there were clearly inaccuracies.\u201d",
      "Magwenya said South Africa hoped to have more engagements with the Trump administration at various levels, including with \u201cinfluential figures like Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "The new law targets land that is unused or not being utilized in the public interest, and property rights are protected, according to the government. No land has been taken under the law, which was only signed by Ramaphosa two weeks ago and is a result of years of consultations and Parliamentary debates.",
      "It is designed to address some of the wrongs of South Africa\u2019s previous apartheid regime of white minority rule, where Black people had land taken away from them and were forced to live in designated areas for non-whites. The last land audit in South Africa estimated that whites \u2014 who make up 7% of the population of 62 million \u2014 own around 70% of land.",
      "In addition to the land law, Musk, who grew up in South Africa, has criticized its affirmative action policies and has falsely claimed that the killings of some white farmers amount to \u201cgenocide.\u201d The killings have been condemned but experts say they are part of South Africa\u2019s appallingly high levels of violent crime and are generally connected to farm robberies.",
      "Musk has put forward an overriding view that South African authorities are racist against their white citizens, but his stance has also become intertwined with his business interests. Musk accused South Africa on his social media site X this week of having \u201cracist ownership laws.\u201d",
      "While it wasn\u2019t clear exactly what he was referencing, it appeared to be the country\u2019s affirmative action laws that require part-Black ownership of some companies, also an attempt to rectify historic wrongs under apartheid, which ended in 1994. Musk left South Africa after completing high school in the late 1980s and moved to Canada.",
      "Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite internet service has been denied a license in South Africa because it doesn\u2019t meet affirmative action criteria.",
      "Ramaphosa held prior discussions with Musk over the possibility of him investing in South Africa, Magwenya said. \u201cHis (Musk\u2019s) particular issues were around Starlink, as well as the regulatory environment that regulates that sector.\u201d",

      "A new coalition of nonprofits came together overnight to challenge a seemingly sweeping order from the Trump administration last week pausing trillions of dollars in federal funding",
      "NEW YORK -- A new coalition of nonprofits came together overnight to challenge a seemingly sweeping order from the Trump administration last week pausing trillions of dollars in federal funding. They succeeded in blocking that order, at least for now.",
      "It's the start of what nonprofits expect will be a deluge of court actions, as civil litigation promises to be a powerful tool civil society groups plan to use to push back on President Donald Trump\u2019s policies.",
      "\u201cThere will be an avalanche of litigation to stop unlawful activity,\u201d said Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which brought the nonprofit coalition\u2019s suit against the federal funding freeze. A judge ruled Monday to allow their lawsuit, one of many filed in the first weeks of the new administration, to move forward and extended a temporary restraining order.",
      "More than a dozen federal lawsuits have already been filed against President Trump and his administration by a wide range of nonprofits, from several Quaker organizations to the consumer rights group Public Citizen to New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support.",
      "Many considered policy changes under the new administration, but few contemplated the total suspension of foreign aid or a widespread pause of federal funding. The federal funding freeze was a moment widely viewed by the nonprofit sector as an existential crisis. And organizations took a range of approaches from keeping their heads down, to organizing community forums, to firing up supporters to contact Congress.",
      "Diane Yentel, the president and CEO the National Council of Nonprofits, moved quickly to take action. She had already been tracking the impact of President Donald Trump's initial executive orders on nonprofits when she saw the memo in the evening on Jan. 27.",
      "The Office of Management and Budget order said: \u201cFederal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance.\u201d",
      "Posting to LinkedIn that night, Yentel wrote, the OMB memo was, \u201ca potential 5-alarm fire for nonprofits and the people and communities they serve,\u201d adding, \u201cWe won\u2019t stand by and let it happen.\u201d",
      "Within hours, the National Council of Nonprofits, Democracy Forward, and several other groups joined forces and hammered out a legal strategy.",
      "\u201cWe worked throughout the night to pull it all together and be able by 9 a.m. for the attorneys to call the judge in the district court and let them know that there would be a challenge to this order and that we would need to have an emergency hearing that day,\u201d Yentel said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Tom Watson, president and founder of philanthropic consulting firm CauseWired, was pleased to see the collective action led by the National Council of Nonprofits, along with several other groups including the American Public Health Association, Main Street Alliance, which supports small businesses, and SAGE, which serves LGBTQ+ adults.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a short thunderstorm that we can just ride out and then, everything will be back to normal,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s more of a massive tidal wave,\u201d that threatens to sweep away the whole ecosystem.",
      "Nonprofits and their funders can draw on experiences from the first Trump administration and the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 which created similar upheaval. But many see the federal funding freeze as unprecedented.",
      "Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said access to some of the platforms where nonprofit organizations receive funding was cut off even before the deadline the Trump administration set in its memo, increasing the sense of confusion and panic.",
      "Her organization called on people to contact their representatives in Congress to provide them information about the consequences of this potential funding freeze. At least 10,000 people used their electronic contact form to reach members of Congress, NAEH reported last week.",
      "Grace Bonilla, president of The United Way of New York City, which receives state and local government funding to support food pantries at hundreds of small organizations in New York City, said those organizations are already impacted not just by concerns about funding freezes, but by the administration's other policies, like increased immigration enforcement, for example.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s week three,\u201d she said, referring to the start of the Trump administration. Bonilla said she's been constantly talking with other nonprofit leaders, funders and corporations about how they should respond. For now, many are just waiting to see what happens next, she said.",
      "\u201cPeople are painfully aware about what this means, not just to their bottom line budget, but what it means in the cost of people, the number of people that are going to be hurt by any of these things actually coming to fruition,\" she said.",
      "Bonilla said it\u2019s hard for leaders of nonprofits and others in the private sector to say, \u201cThis is the thing that we\u2019re going to stand behind,\u201d because they don\u2019t know what will come next.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump&rsquo;s threats to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada have left many cities along Mexico's northern border in limbo",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada have left many cities along Mexico's northern border in limbo",
      "CIUDAD JU\u00c1REZ, Mexico -- As soon as the sun glints over miles of border fence dividing the United States and Mexico, the engines of cargo trucks packed with auto and computer parts roar to life along border bridges and bleary-eyed workers file into factories to assemble a multitude of products geared toward the U.S. market.",
      "For more than half a century, this daily rhythm has helped fuel the heartbeat of a transnational machine that generated more than $800 billion in trade between the U.S. and Mexico in 2024 alone.",
      "Over the past year, however, President Donald Trump's threatened 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canada have plunged manufacturing hubs all along the northern Mexican border into limbo, a state that persists despite a one-month reprieve to which Trump agreed on Monday.",
      "Tariffs would cripple Mexican border economies that are reliant on factories churning out products for the U.S. \u2014 auto parts, medical supplies, computer components, myriad electronics \u2014  and likely thrust the country into a recession, economic forecasters have warned. Some workers wonder how much longer they'll have jobs, while business leaders say the uncertainty has already led many investors to start tightening their purse strings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a conflict between governments and we\u2019re the ones most affected,\u201d said 58-year-old truck driver Carlos Ponce, leaning against his rig at the customs border crossing between Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso, Texas. \u201cTomorrow, who knows what will happen?\u201d",
      "Ponce, who was driving a truck full of car shock absorbers, said he's spent the past 35 years moving goods across the border, just as his father did before him. Now, he's unsure how much longer that will last.",
      "Manufacturing in export-oriented assembly plants known as maquiladoras are the heart of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez's economy, with 97% of its goods going to the U.S., according to figures from Mexico's Economic Ministry.",
      "The factories were born in the 1960s in an attempt to boost economic development in northern Mexico and lower prices for U.S. consumers. The maquiladora program later took off after the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, was signed in 1994. The agreement was supplanted by a similar pact, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, negotiated between the three countries during Trump's first term.",
      "Today, neon signs with the dollar-to-peso exchange rate flash across the city, a reminder of the close ties binding both sides of the border.",
      "\u201cEverything that happens in the United States: its economic, social policy \u2026 directly affects us because companies here in Mexico depend on what they sell in the United States,\u201d said Thor Salayandia, head of his family's auto-parts manufacturing facility in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. \"The United States also needs Mexico to keep manufacturing, but they\u2019re not seeing things like that.\u201d",
      "This week, workers and business leaders alike breathed a sigh of relief when Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced she had negotiated with Trump to delay tariffs one month.",
      "\u201cNow, we're buying time,\u201d Salayandia said.",
      "Workers here assemble everything from auto parts to computer panels to T-shirts emblazoned with the American flag, logos of popular U.S. football teams and slogans such as \u201cProud to be a federal employee.\u201d",
      "Parts can cross the border multiple times before the final product is sold to U.S. consumers. That economic interdependence has left many in the city struggling to imagine a future without it. One U.S. company said it would likely have to move part of its manufacturing in the city to the U.S., but at a sharp cost.",
      "Antonio Ruiz, a compliance officer at Tecma, a U.S. firm that helps foreign companies set up shop along the border, said his was among a number of businesses to call emergency meetings over the weekend as economic forecasters warned that the tariffs could drive Mexico into a recession.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to be prepared for something that has never happened before,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cAs much as you want to prepare for it, the best you can do is prepare to brace yourself in the short term.\u201d",
      "Salayandia and economists warn that any sort of tax could lead to cascading unemployment and rising prices on both sides of the border. In Mexico, they say, it could also spur a rise in violence in border areas by pushing the unemployed into the hands of drug cartels, as well as an increase in Mexican migration to the U.S.",
      "Manuel Sotelo, a leader of Mexico\u2019s National Chamber of Freight Transportation who owns a fleet of trucks that cross the border every day, sees the tariff threats as more of a political power move than a future economic reality.",
      "\"Both countries would be paralyzed,\" said Sotelo, who sat at a desk covered with local newspapers carrying bold headlines on the tariffs, a Trump bobblehead positioned behind him. \u201cLet's say he did slap a 25% tariff (on Mexico), what would they do during the Super Bowl without avocados?\u201d",
      "On the other hand, Sotelo acknowledges that the tariff talk has already inflicted some damage. He and other business leaders say that over the past year they've watched investment dip in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez because of political uncertainty, as investors hesitate to funnel their money into businesses that could collapse with the stroke of a pen in Washington.",
      "While Trump's election has been the primary driver of that uncertainty, June elections in Mexico and a controversial judicial reform carried out by Mexico's governing party have added to it. Sotelo said he saw a 7% drop in business last year, and only expects that to continue until lingering tariff threats are resolved.",
      "One collective of maquiladoras in the city says it has seen at least three factories halt production.",
      "\u201cEvery time we hear this discourse from political leaders, the people running our governments, it sends shock waves through the border,\u201d Salayandia said. \"Because the border is a global thermometer. Our products go all over the world. Those companies will go look in other parts of the world where they offer conditions to keep competing.\u201d",

      "There were some oversized expectations for the animated film but \"Moana 2\", originally intended as a series for the company's streaming service before it was produced for the big screen \u2014 blew predictions out of the water. Its five-day opening set a new record for Thanksgiving moviegoing.",
      "The Walt Disney Co. earned $2.55 billion, or $1.40 per share, for the period ended Dec. 28. The Burbank, California-based company earned $1.91 billion, or $1.04 per share, in the prior-year period.",
      "Stripping out one-time charges and benefits, earnings were $1.76 per share, which is 32 cents better than Wall Street was expecting, according to analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.",
      "Revenue rose 5% to $24.69 billion, a bit better than analysts had projected.",
      "Revenue in Disney's Entertainment segment increased 9%. Revenue for content sales/licensing and Other jumped 34% due to the strong performance of \u201cMoana 2.\u201d",
      "CEO Bob Iger and Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said in a prepared remarks that the Moana film franchise demonstrates the strong connection that audiences have with Disney's stories and characters and further validates the company's strategy of investing in popular intellectual property.",
      "Disney\u2019s direct-to-consumer business, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, reported quarterly operating income of $293 million compared with an operating loss of $138 million a year ago. Revenue increased 9% to $6.07 billion.",
      "The Disney+ streaming service had a 1% increase in paid subscribers domestically, which includes the U.S. and Canada. But there was a 2% drop internationally, which excludes Disney+ HotStar. Total paid subscribers for Disney+ dipped 1% in the quarter. Disney also said that it had 125 million Disney+ subscribers in the quarter, a slight decline from the year-ago period.",
      "\u201cDisney\u2019s earnings beat underscores the success of its cost-cutting initiatives and resilient performance in parks and studios, offsetting headwinds in streaming,\" Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in an emailed statement. \u201cHowever, the surprising loss of Disney+ subscribers\u2014the first decline since its 2019 launch\u2014raises red flags about saturation in a crowded market and the trade-offs of its pricing strategy.\u201d",
      "Looking ahead, Disney said that it foresees a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers in the second quarter when compared with the first quarter. The company still anticipates high-single digit adjusted earnings per share growth for fiscal 2025.",
      "The Experiences division, which includes six global theme parks, its cruise line, merchandise and videogame licensing, reported operating income was basically flat at $3.11 billion. Operating income fell 5% at domestic parks, as hurricanes caused Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida to close for a day and canceled a cruise. Operating income rose 28% for international parks and Experiences.",

      "The nation\u2019s growing home insurance crisis is in the spotlight as Californians begin the long road to rebuilding after the deadly Eaton and Palisades wildfires.",
      "For neighbors Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson, the difference in insurance coverage on their nearly identical homes in Altadena reveals how unequal that recovery will be.",
      "Hamlin was privately insured and has already been paid out nearly a million dollars. She is searching for contractors to rebuild her house.",
      "Wilson will receive a fraction of what he needs because he was covered by the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state\u2019s bare-bones insurance program known as the FAIR Plan. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "The plan is a temporary coverage option created by the state as a last resort for homeowners who can't find private insurance. More Californians are relying on it than ever after several major insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in the state in recent years.",
      "In Wilson\u2019s case, his private insurer declined to renew his policy last year although he offered to install various fire mitigation efforts. No other insurers were willing to write him a new policy, forcing Wilson to get on the FAIR Plan to satisfy his mortgage requirements.",
      "The number of FAIR residential policies issued in the state more than doubled between 2020 and 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies.",
      "Under the FAIR Plan, Wilson paid about 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, though he is slated to receive less than half the coverage. And his true home insurance cost was actually much higher because he also had to buy \u201cwrap-around insurance\u201d for issues the FAIR Plan doesn\u2019t cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects.",
      "The Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurers, said the FAIR Plan provides a lifeline for homeowners who cannot find private insurance, and that outcomes would be far worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "State officials have rolled out several new regulations to give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing more policies in high-risk areas. That includes allowing insurers to consider climate change when setting their prices and allowing them pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers.",
      "Governments also have to shoulder the costs for serious mitigation efforts, or the price of California\u2019s fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, said Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley. California is proposing to direct roughly $25 million from a voter-approved climate bond to bolster fire mitigation requirements around homes.",

      "YANGON, Myanmar -- A renewed attempt to auction off the family home of Myanmar\u2019s imprisoned former leader Aung San Suu Kyi was unsuccessful Wednesday as the prospect of paying tens of millions of dollars for a property in a country embroiled in a civil war failed to attract any bidders.",
      "It was the third attempt to sell the lakeside property where Suu Kyi had been held under house arrest for nearly 15 years. It's widely viewed as a historical landmark of her nonviolent struggle against military rule for which she won the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "In the previous attempt at auction last August, the court-ordered asking price was $142 million; on Wednesday it was reduced by $1 million, to $141 million.",
      "Suu Kyi's democratically elected government was ousted by the military in February 2021. She is now serving a combined 27-year sentence after being convicted of a string of criminal charges that supporters say have been fabricated to discredit her.",
      "Since then, resistance to the military government has grown and the country is now in the midst of a brutal civil war.",
      "The court-ordered auction followed a bitter decades-long legal dispute between Suu Kyi and her brother, Aung San Oo, who has sought an equal division of the property.",
      "Each time the house has gone up for auction its price has been reduced, but there has yet to be a bidder.",
      "In March, the asking price was 315 billion kyats, about $150 million at official rates, and the second was in August with 300 billion kyats, more than $142 million.",
      "On Wednesday, the opening asking price for the 1.9-acre (0.78-hectare) lakeside property in Yangon was set at 297 billion kyats. That's about $141 million at official rates, or about $66 million at black-market rates, which better reflect the real value of the kyat.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s auction was held in front of the closed gates of the property, which has served as an unofficial party headquarters and a political shrine for the country\u2019s pro-democracy movement.",

      "\u201cThe auction is unsuccessful as there is no bidder,\u201d the official, who did not identify herself, announced outside the gate.",
      "The two-story colonial-style building on Inye Lake in Yangon, the country\u2019s largest city, was given decades ago by the government to Suu Kyi\u2019s mother, Khin Kyi, after her husband, independence hero Gen. Aung San, was assassinated in July 1947.",
      "Suu Kyi, 79, remained there after her 2010 release from house arrest until moving in 2012 to the capital, Naypyitaw, to serve in parliament. She became the nation\u2019s leader after a 2015 general election.",

      "People who make a habit of sleeping on the job comprise a secret society of sorts within the U.S. labor force",
      "NEW YORK -- They snooze in parking garages, on side streets before the afternoon school run, in nap pods rented by the hour or stretched out in bed while working from home.",
      "People who make a habit of sleeping on the job comprise a secret society of sorts within the U.S. labor force. Inspired by famous power nappers Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein, today's committed nap-takers often sneak in short rest breaks because they think the practice will improve their cognitive performance but still carries a stigma.",
      "Multiple studies have extolled the benefits of napping, such as enhanced memory and focus. A mid-afternoon siesta is the norm in parts of Spain and Italy. In China and Japan, nodding off is encouraged since working to the point of exhaustion is seen as a display of dedication, according to a study in the journal Sleep.",
      "Yet it's hard to catch a few z's during regular business hours in the United States, where people who nap can be viewed as lazy. The federal government even bans sleeping in its buildings while at work, except in rare circumstances.",
      "Individuals who are willing and able to challenge the status quo are becoming less hesitant to describe the payoffs of taking a dose of microsleep. Marvin Stockwell, the founder of PR firm Champion the Cause, takes short naps several times a week.",
      "\u201cThey rejuvenate me in a way that I\u2019m exponentially more useful and constructive and creative on the other side of a nap than I am when I\u2019m forcing myself to gut through being tired,\u201d Stockwell said.",
      "Sleep is as important to good health as diet and exercise, but too many people don\u2019t get enough of it, according to James Rowley, program director of the Sleep Medicine Fellowship at Rush University Medical Center.",
      "\u201cA lot of it has to do with electronics. It used to be TVs, but now cellphones are probably the biggest culprit. People just take them to bed with them and watch,\u201d Rowley said.\u201d",
      "Napping isn\u2019t common in academia, where there\u2019s constant pressure to publish, but University of Southern California lecturer Julianna Kirschner fits in daytime naps when she can. Kirschner studies social media, which she says is designed to deliver a dopamine rush to the brain. Viewers lose track of time on the platforms, interrupting sleep. Kirschner says she isn\u2019t immune to this problem \u2014 hence, her occasional need to nap.",
      "The key to effective napping is to keep the snooze sessions short, Rowley said. Short naps can be restorative and are more likely to leave you more alert, he said.",
      "\u201cMost people don\u2019t realize naps should be in the 15- to 20-minute range,\u201d Rowley said. \u201cAnything longer, and you can have problems with sleep inertia, difficulty waking up, and you\u2019re groggy.\u201d",
      "Individuals who find themselves consistently relying on naps to make up for inadequate sleep should probably also examine their bedtime habits, he said.",
      "Mid-afternoon is the ideal time for a nap because it coincides with a natural circadian dip, while napping after 6 p.m. may interfere with nocturnal sleep for those who work during daylight hours, said Michael Chee, director of the Centre for Sleep and Cognition at the National University of Singapore..",
      "\u201cAny duration of nap, you will feel recharged. It\u2019s a relief valve. There are clear cognitive benefits,\u201d Chee said.",
      "A review of napping studies suggests that 30 minutes is the optimal nap length in terms of practicality and benefits, said Ruth Leong, a research fellow at the Singapore center.",
      "\u201cWhen people nap for too long, it may not be a sustainable practice, and also, really long naps that cross the two-hour mark affect nighttime sleep,\u201d Leong said.",
      "Experts recommend setting an alarm for 20 to 30 minutes, which gives nappers a few minutes to fall asleep.",
      "But even a six-minute nap can be restorative and improve learning, said Valentin Dragoi, scientific director of the Center for Neural Systems Restoration, a research and treatment facility run by Houston Methodist hospital and Rice University.",
      "While workplace dozing is uncommon in the U.S., some companies and managers encourage it. Will Bryk, founder of AI search startup Exa, swears by 20-minute power naps and ordered two sleeping pods for employees to use in his company's San Francisco office.",
      "Ice cream maker Ben & Jerry\u2019s has had a nap room in its Vermont headquarters for a couple of decades, and a handful of employees use it, company spokesman Sean Greenwood said. \u201cEmployees who feel taken care of are much more likely to use this responsibly,\" he said.",
      "Arianna Huffington, the celebrity author who co-founded news website Huffington Post, became an advocate of a good night\u2019s sleep and occasional naps after she collapsed from exhaustion in 2007. She installed a nap room at her former company, now called HuffPo, and at Thrive Global, a wellness technology company where she serves as founder and CEO.",
      "\u201cIf people have been up all night because of a sick child or a delayed flight, if they have the opportunity to nap, ... then they will be much more productive and creative for the rest of the day instead of dragging themselves or trying to boost their energy through multiple coffee or cinnamon buns,\u201d Huffington said in an email.",
      "Kirsten Perez, 33, is a devoted napper. She used to use her lunch break at work to catch a few winks in her car. When she got her own office, she closed the door for an afternoon siesta while sitting at her desk.",
      "Nowadays, working from home as a marketing manager at Nvidia, the Atlanta resident usually takes her daily nap in bed. She sets an alarm for 15 minutes, falls asleep within a minute and wakes up 30 seconds before the alarm rings.",
      "\u201cI can tell when my reasoning, my mood are dropping, just kind of feeling the drag of the day,\u201d Perez said. In those situations, she asks herself, \u201c\u2018Do I have a chunk of time in the next hour or so?\u2019 And then I\u2019ll figure out when I can find 15 minutes and find myself horizontal.\u201d",
      "Naps are accepted and even a necessity in some occupations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages naps for nurses working night shifts. But many nurses can't sleep at the hospitals where they work because they're too busy and aren't given access to beds.",
      "Nurses \"regularly struggle to have sufficient time to use the bathroom or go outside for fresh air, no less take a nap,\" Michelle Morris, spokesperson for the National Nurses United union, said.",
      "Some companies are trying to fill the void. Inspired by his mother who worked as a nurse, Neil Wong founded Nap York, which offers sleeping pods in Manhattan and Queens that can be rented for about $27 an hour.",
      "His regular customers include super-commuters, UPS drivers, a security guard who works two full-time jobs, and doctors who work at nearby hospitals. Nap York also gives half-off prices to essential workers such as police officers, firefighters and emergency medical service personnel.",
      "\u201cIn this society, you really only have two place to sleep: you have your bed at home and you have a hotel room you can probably get for 100 bucks,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no third space that\u2019s quiet, that provides some privacy, where you can also rest.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 06:58:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Edmunds compares certified pre-owned vehicles and standard used cars, highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of each",
    "story": [
      "Edmunds compares certified pre-owned vehicles and standard used cars, highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of each",
      "When shopping for a used car, many buyers struggle to know if paying extra for a certified pre-owned one is worth it. Buying a certified pre-owned vehicle, commonly called a CPO vehicle, has benefits and drawbacks. Understanding the differences can help you make an informed choice that aligns with your budget, priorities and desire for peace of mind. Here Edmunds editors take an in-depth look at the benefits, limitations and considerations for each.",
      "Certified pre-owned vehicles are used vehicles that have been inspected and refurbished by a dealership to meet specific quality standards determined by the manufacturer. They typically come with a manufacturer-backed warranty, roadside assistance and other perks.",
      "One of the primary benefits of a certified pre-owned vehicle is the assurance of quality. These cars undergo an inspection process \u2014 often encompassing 100 to 200 points \u2014 to ensure they meet safety, performance and cosmetic standards. Any necessary repairs or replacements are completed before the vehicle is put up for sale. Buyers also benefit from additional protections, such as extended manufacturer warranties that often cover major components and systems beyond the original factory warranty.",
      "Another advantage is that certified pre-owned vehicles may come with added perks, such as complimentary maintenance, roadside assistance, and sometimes even exchange or return policies. These benefits can provide significant peace of mind for buyers who want reliability at a lower cost than a new car.",
      "However, these advantages come at a price. Certified pre-owned vehicles are typically more expensive than non-certified used cars. This premium can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars depending on the make, model and dealership.",
      "Most used vehicles are sold as-is, without any manufacturer-backed certification or guarantees. While they don\u2019t come with the same assurances as certified pre-owned vehicles, they do typically cost less.",
      "Affordability is the biggest draw of buying a regular used car. This upside makes a standard used vehicle an attractive option for those looking to save money up front. However, purchasing a standard used car carries more risk because it\u2019s harder to know the vehicle\u2019s true condition. While some dealerships may offer limited warranties, these are usually less comprehensive than the coverage provided with certified pre-owned vehicles.",
      "Budget should be your first consideration in this decision. If you have the financial flexibility to pay more for a certified pre-owned vehicle, it may be worth the investment.",
      "Next, think about your risk tolerance and maintenance preferences. If peace of mind is a top priority, the thorough inspection and warranty coverage of a certified pre-owned vehicle can provide significant value. But if you\u2019re comfortable conducting your own due diligence and gambling a bit on future repair costs, a standard used car might be the better choice.",
      "The vehicle\u2019s age and mileage are also important considerations. Certified pre-owned programs typically have strict requirements for these factors, so you\u2019ll likely find newer models with lower mileage. This also means that you\u2019ll find a better selection when shopping for non-certified used cars.",
      "Finally, be sure to research the dealership and manufacturer\u2019s certification program. Not all CPO programs are created equal; some offer more comprehensive inspections and better warranties than others. Similarly, when buying a standard used vehicle, seek out a reputable dealership. Paying for your own inspection is a good idea with any standard used vehicle. Expect to spend $200 to $300.",
      "Buying a certified pre-owned vehicle doesn\u2019t guarantee a trouble-free ownership experience. Problems can still arise, although they\u2019re less likely than with a non-certified used car.",
      "Standard used vehicles also have their drawbacks, chiefly the lack of warranty and inspection guarantees. Also, be aware of the look-alike certified warranty. These are warranties offered by the dealership selling the vehicle, which rarely meet the same standards as a manufacturer CPO warranty. For example, the vehicle will likely only be eligible for warranty repairs at that dealership, while many CPO programs let you take your car to any certified dealership.",
      "Whether you\u2019re buying a Certified pre-owned or regular used vehicle, be certain to read the fine print that determines the terms of your purchase or your warranty coverage. A few examples: Some standard used vehicles may come with a return or exchange policy that can add comfort to the transaction. And sometimes redeeming all your benefits under a CPO program must be done within a certain time window, which limits its value.",

    "story": [
      "The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third time in six months later Thursday even though inflation remains above its target",
      "LONDON -- The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third time in six months later Thursday, even though inflation remains above its target.",
      "Most economists think the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee will lower the bank's main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.50%, taking it to its lowest level since mid-2023. The base rate helps dictate how expensive it is for individuals to take out a mortgage or a loan, while also influencing the returns offered by banks on savings.",
      "Of particular interest to financial markets is what the bank's accompanying economic forecasts show and the tone of Gov. Andrew Bailey in his ensuing press briefing.",
      "\u201cUntil now, the bank has cut at alternate meetings, but a stagnating economy and declining employment argue for more urgent action,\u201d said Andrew Wishart, senior U.K. economist at Berenberg Bank.",
      "The rate-setting panel is tasked with ensuring that inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, hits a 2% target over the coming couple years or so.",
      "Though inflation is standing at 2.5% and expected to rise in coming months, partly as a result of business tax increases from the new Labour government, most economists think it will then trend lower towards the target, hence the panel's ability to cut.",
      "Official figures earlier this month showed a surprise decline in the inflation rate to 2.5% in the year to December, largely as a result of easing price pressures in the services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the U.K. economy.",
      "Another potential reason for rate-setters to cut borrowing rates is that economic growth in the U.K. has stagnated, which will likely put downward pressure on inflation.",
      "Inflation is way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic."

      "U.S. President Donald Trump says he will cut all funding to South Africa over what he called a massive human rights violation",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump said he will cut all funding to South Africa over what he called a human rights violation, a move that reflects Elon Musk's repeated and false claims over the years that authorities in his country of birth are anti-white and even encouraging the killing of white people.",
      "Trump said on Sunday that \u201cterrible things are happening in South Africa. The leadership is doing some terrible things, horrible things\u201d without providing specifics. He said \u201cthey're taking away land, they're confiscating land, and actually they're doing things that are perhaps far worse than that.\u201d",
      "While it wasn't clear exactly what Trump was referring to, he appeared to be referencing a new law in South Africa that gives the government powers in some instances to expropriate land from people.",
      "Musk, a close Trump ally and head of Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, has highlighted that law in recent social media posts and cast it as a threat to South Africa's white minority.",
      "Many South Africans viewed Trump's sudden pledge to punish America's biggest trade partner in Africa as surprising and at least partly influenced by billionaire Tesla owner Musk, who was born in the South African capital of Pretoria but left for Canada after he completed high school.",
      "The Expropriation Act was signed into law by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa last month and allows the government to take land in specific instances where it is not being used, or where it would be in the public interest if it is redistributed.",
      "It aims to address some of the wrongs of South Africa's racist apartheid era, when Black people had land taken away from them and were forced to live in areas designated for non-whites.",
      "Ramaphosa responded to Trump's comments Monday by saying the U.S. president was wrong and no land had been confiscated, and said he looked forward to \"engaging\" with the Trump administration over the issue. The South African government said that the U.S. didn't understand the law.",
      "Musk accused Ramaphosa's government in 2023 of allowing a \u201cgenocide\u201d to happen over the killings of some white farmers, which have happened for years.",
      "While the killings have been condemned, experts have said there is no evidence of any genocide and they are part of South Africa's extremely high violent crime rates and mostly related to farm robberies. Crime affects all South Africans, and the country has an average of 70 homicides a day, with the vast majority of the victims Black.",
      "Musk also waded into the issue Monday by replying to a post by Ramaphosa's official account on X with the question: \u201cWhy do you have openly racist ownership laws?\u201d",
      "Again, it remains unclear exactly what Musk was referring to, but his comments seemed to allude to South Africa's affirmative action laws in business that are designed to advance opportunities for Blacks and other racial groups who were disadvantaged under apartheid. Musk's Starlink satellite internet service has been denied a license in South Africa because it doesn't meet affirmative action criteria.",
      "More than 30 years after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule, white people in South Africa generally still have a much higher standard of living than Black people.",
      "That's reflected in poverty statistics, with a 2021 study by the South African Human Rights Commission finding that 64% of Black people were living in poverty against 1% of white people. When it comes to land, white people make up about 7% of the population of 62 million and own around 70% of land, according to the most recent land audit, although that share has decreased since apartheid.",
      "Still, the new land law has drawn criticism even from inside the country, with civic groups that represent the interests of whites and some South African political parties saying they will challenge it in court because it allows land to be taken without compensation in some cases.",
      "While South Africa has deep socioeconomic problems and a damaging legacy from nearly a half-century of apartheid, it is regarded as a stable democracy and is not a country brimming with racial tensions as it is sometimes portrayed to be.",
      "Trump said on his Truth Social platform that South Africa was \u201ctreating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,\u201d again without elaborating, and he would stop all future funding while the U.S. investigated.",
      "That threatens around $400 million a year in aid the U.S. gives to South Africa, most of it for the country's HIV/AIDS program through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR. South Africa's U.S. funding through PEPFAR was already threatened by Trump's global aid freeze.",
      "South Africa was also concerned that Trump might remove it from the AGOA trade agreement, which gives South Africa and other African nations tariff-free access to the U.S. market. Trump has already imposed tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico \u2014 although on Monday he said he is pausing his tariffs planned for Mexico by one month.",

      "Saquon Barkley, Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles stand in their way.",
      "The Chiefs (17-2) will try to become the first team to win three straight Super Bowls when they face the Eagles (17-3) on Sunday in the Superdome.",
      "It\u2019s a rematch from two years ago when Hurts nearly led the Eagles to a championship only to watch Mahomes snatch it away by rallying Kansas City to a 38-35 win on Harrison Butker\u2019s 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds left.",
      "Mahomes lifted the Chiefs to an overtime win against San Francisco in another Super Bowl rematch last year. Now, they\u2019re poised for a three-peat, a word coach Andy Reid doesn\u2019t use much.",
      "\"I think the only time I\u2019ve heard him say it is to the media whenever y\u2019all ask him about it,\" Mahomes said. \"He\u2019s very locked in on just, \u2018How can we be great with our cadence today at practice?\u2019 so that\u2019s just the stuff that Coach Reid focuses on.\"",
      "Reid won more games than any coach in franchise history during his 14 seasons in Philadelphia but couldn\u2019t win the big one, going 1-4 in NFC championship games and losing a Super Bowl to the Patriots. He went right to Kansas City after the Eagles fired him following the 2012 season and has built a dynasty thanks to Mahomes, Kelce, Chris Jones and others.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have time to think about all that,\u201d Reid said of the three-peat. \u201cYou\u2019re focused in on the job at hand here and that\u2019s playing against a great Eagles team.\u201d",
      "Jones, the three-time All-Pro defensive tackle, echoed his coach\u2019s viewpoint.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about no three-peat,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for. We understand that. We understand there\u2019s one more game until the offseason and we can do whatever we want to do. Our main focus is making sure we\u2019re prepared for the Eagles.\u201d",
      "No matter what the Chiefs say, everyone else is talking about it. No team has done it in the Super Bowl era, though the Green Bay Packers won an NFL championship in 1965 and followed by winning the first two Super Bowls. Kelce even started all the three-peat talk on stage last year when he said the team\u2019s goal was to win three.",
      "\u201cThis is gonna be our biggest test yet,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cThey got a lot of great players but the biggest thing is they play great together. You could see their communication. You could see the accountability they have, especially in the secondary. It\u2019s not gonna make my job any easier.\u201d",
      "These Eagles are different from the group that fell just short against Kansas City in Arizona two years ago.",
      "They have the NFL\u2019s most dynamic player in the backfield. Barkley rushed for 2,447 yards with seven touchdowns of 60-plus yards in the regular season and playoffs.",
      "\u201cThe goal has always been to win it, not just to get here,\u201d Barkley said.",
      "Losing to the Chiefs two years ago only motivated Hurts even more. He\u2019s determined to hoist a Lombardi trophy and even had a photo of him walking off the field with Kansas City\u2019s red and yellow confetti falling around him as the background on his phone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s had a great driving force,\u201d Hurts said of that loss. \u201cIt lit a flame, lit a fire in me, and to have this opportunity again is exactly what you work for.\u201d",
      "Hurts, Barkley, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and a dominant offensive line present a major challenge for Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.",
      "The Eagles also have the league\u2019s No. 1-ranked defense, featuring eight new starters from 2022 and defensive coordinator Vic Fangio.",
      "All-Pro linebacker Zack Baun and rookie cornerbacks Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean plus the emergence of defensive tackle Jalen Carter and edge rusher Nolan Smith has transformed a defensive unit that fell apart last season.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to have Steve Spagnuolo, but I tell you that Vic is one of those guys,\u201d Reid said. \u201cHe\u2019s just one of those really creative defensive minds that survived a long time in this league. He\u2019s been time-tested, and, he has the trust of his players.\u201d",
      "If the Chiefs win, Reid and Mahomes will be one step closer to Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. They\u2019re halfway to the six Belichick and Brady won together in New England and Mahomes is still four away from Brady\u2019s seven rings.",

      "Prices on the secondary-ticket market for Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl in New Orleans are much less than last year\u2019s big game and declining",
      "Prices on the secondary-ticket market for Sunday's Super Bowl in New Orleans are much less than last year's big game and declining, but still high by historical standards.",
      "The average price for the Kansas City Chiefs-Philadelphia Eagles game at TickPick was $6,552 as of Tuesday. If that amount holds, it would be that website's third highest for a Super Bowl.",
      "Last year's game between the Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers had an average price at that site of $9,136. The only other Super Bowl to attract a higher average price was four years ago when the amount was $7,046 for Chiefs' game against the hometown Tampa Bay Buccaneers when the crowd was limited to 25,000 fans because of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The lowest price for this year's game was just less than $4,000, which has declined about 30% since the matchup was set.",
      "Gametime reports a similar trend, also noting last year's game had a minimum price of $8,764 shortly before kickoff.",
      "\u201cWith last year\u2019s Vegas hype and 49ers fan frenzy behind us, prices are seeing a natural market correction,\u201d Gametime said in a statement. \u201cPlus, with no major \u2018pent-up\u2019 demand from either fan base, tickets are looking better than ever.\u201d",
      "The lowest tickets prices at Vivid Seats and StubHub also were less than $4,000.",
      "TickPick co-CEO Brett Goldberg said there were a number of reasons why ticket prices are notably lower than last year.",
      "That game was the first in Las Vegas, creating even more fan interest than usual. The close proximity of Allegiant Stadium to the nation's eighth-busiest airport and Las Vegas Strip entertainment corrider that includes many of the world's largest hotels contributed to record prices.",
      "Hotel capacity in New Orleans is more limited with about 26,000 rooms in the city center, and even home rentals are at a premium.",
      "\u201cIf you try to go book a hotel right now, it's very challenging,\u201d Goldberg said.",
      "Another problem is the matchup.",
      "This is the third Super Bowl in a row for the Chiefs and the second in three years for the Eagles.",
      "\u201cI think if the Bills won, you would've seen a very different dynamic here,\u201d Goldberg said. \"There's a part of that (Chiefs) fan base that can afford to go to the Super Bowl three times, but that's a very small (segment of the) fan base that could do that.",
      "\u201cEven the Eagles have a little bit of a fatigue from being at a Super Bowl two years ago. We're hearing directly from fans, \u2018I went two years ago. I\u2019m not sure I could pull this off.' Would they love to go? Sure, but the impracticality on it's a $10,000 trip for two becomes very limiting.\u201d",
      "Goldberg said he hasn't received feedback that the New Year's Day terrorist attack in which 14 people were killed by a motorist on Bourbon Street played a significant part in the price decline.",
      "New Orleans is about to host its 11th Super Bowl, though first in 12 years.",
      "But the been-there, done-that feel is another factor, Goldberg said, and one Las Vegas could eventually face as well at one point.",
      "\u201cBy the time you do it a third time, the stadium won't be as new,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cI do think it could lose some of its appeal.\u201d",

      "The century-old sliding center being completely rebuilt for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Games is pushing the deadline really tight",
      "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy -- In Sochi, workers were still hammering away in the media village and shower water ran yellow when journalists from around the world arrived for the 2014 Winter Games.",
      "The chaotic preparations for the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro were labeled the \u201cworst\u201d ever by a vice president of the International Olympic Committee.",
      "The next Olympics, though, might set an unofficial record for running late on preparations.",
      "That\u2019s because the century-old sliding center being completely rebuilt for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Games is pushing the deadline so tight that the IOC has gone so far as to demand a Plan B option that would require moving bobsled, luge and skeleton events all the way to Lake Placid, New York, if the track in Italy isn\u2019t finished in time.",
      "Thursday marks exactly one year to go before the Feb. 6, 2026 opening ceremony at the San Siro stadium and the track in Cortina is still a half-completed construction site.",
      "The IOC has set a deadline for the end of next month for pre-certification of the Cortina track and nobody is saying for sure if it will pass the test.",
      "But Fabio Saldini, the Italian government commissioner in charge of the 118 million euro ($123 million) project, told The Associated Press during a recent visit that almost 70% of the track was completed \u2014 even if it was tough to tell inside the muddy and chaotic construction site.",
      "With 180 people working from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. every day to build the sliding center, the first ice is slated to be laid down on the track at the start of March.",
      "\u201cWe have huge support from the construction firms, the government and (Infrastructure and Transport Minister Matteo) Salvini,\u201d Saldini said. \u201cWith everyone\u2019s support, we will be able to finish in time.\u201d",
      "Construction began less than a year ago and no sliding track has been built in such a short timeframe. An official test event is slated for October, a step that has taken on more importance since the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili in a training crash hours before the start of the opening ceremony for the 2010 Vancouver Games.",
      "The IOC would have preferred to use an active track in nearby Austria or Switzerland instead of rebuilding the Cortina venue, which had been closed since 2008. But it let the local organizing committee select the Plan B option.",
      "\u201cWe chose Lake Placid because it was the only place where they offered us the track without requiring us to make any investments,\u201d Milan-Cortina CEO Andrea Varnier told AP. \u201cBut we\u2019re counting on holding the sliding sports here in Cortina.\u201d",
      "Added organizing committee president Giovanni Malag\u00f2 about the Lake Placid backup plan: \u201cIt's just a formality. There's no substance to it.\u201d",
      "Environmental groups have protested over climate damage due to the Cortina track's reconstruction.",
      "\u201cThere were 800 trees cut down,\u201d Saldini said. \u201cBut they were not all 100 years old, like some people said. And we\u2019re going to plant 10,000 trees when we\u2019re done.\u201d",
      "General ticket sales for the games are about to start following a pre-registration process that drew in more than 350,000 requests \u2014 70% of them from abroad from more than 210 countries.",
      "Sliding is one of the Games\u2019 most inexpensive attractions with luge events going for as low as 40 euros ($42) and bobsled for a maximum of 100 euros ($104).",
      "But what happens for ticket holders if the sliding track in Cortina isn\u2019t ready and events are moved to Lake Placid?",
      "\u201cIt will be a whole different experience,\u201d said Paul Caine, the president of hospitality package provider On Location, about the prospect of moving from glitzy Cortina to upstate New York.",
      "Caine noted that while \u201cnobody wanted to go to Tahiti\u201d for surfing events in French Polynesia during last year\u2019s Paris Games, hospitality packages were sold for the sailing competitions in Marseille, which is located in southern France \u2014 3 \u00bd hours by train from Paris.",
      "On Location has received requests for hospitality packages from 62 countries so far, with ice hockey, biathlon and figure skating the most popular sports.",
      "Private boxes for the opening ceremony at the iconic San Siro soccer stadium have already sold out.",
      "These are the first Games to fully embrace cost-cutting reforms installed by IOC President Thomas Bach and use mostly existing venues \u2014 which has meant scattering the Games all over northern Italy.",
      "Alpine skiing will be divided between Cortina (for the women\u2019s events) and Bormio (for the men) \u2014 which are separated by a 5 \u00bd-hour drive. Livigno will host freestyle skiing and snowboarding, biathlon will be in Anterselva, Nordic events will be in Val di Fiemme and ice sports in Milan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very complicated due to the big distances and also because of all the different representatives in each region,\u201d Varnier said. \u201cWe have great relationships with everyone but everybody has their own way and style of doing things, so we need to adapt to them. That\u2019s the spirit of these Games: We adapt to the different territories and not vice versa.\u201d",
      "One reason that the organizing committee is adapting to each and every venue is that most of these places have a long history of hosting World Cup races and world championships.",
      "For example, Bormio hosted the Alpine skiing worlds in 1985 and 2005; Cortina hosted the skiing worlds in 2021 and has been the site of more than 100 World Cup ski races; Anterselva has hosted six biathlon worlds dating back to 1975; Val di Fiemme has hosted three Nordic worlds.",
      "Still, none of that does any good for an athlete like Ester Ledecka, the Czech wonder who claimed golds in both Alpine skiing and snowboarding at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games. In 2026, two of Ledecka\u2019s races will be held on the same day in resorts hours apart \u2014 meaning she\u2019ll likely have to choose one over the other.",

      "Dealing with the absence of star freshman Liam McNeeley for much of January and some inconsistent play, the two-time defending national champion UConn Huskies looked like a title contender in their first game in February with a win at Marquette",
      "STORRS, Conn. -- There might not be a team happier to see January in the rear-view mirror than two-time defending national champion UConn.",
      "On the way to a second straight title during the 2023-24 season, not only did the Huskies go undefeated in January, but they never trailed by double digits in those eight games.",
      "What a difference a year makes. With four starters selected in the 2024 NBA Draft and an injury sidelining talented freshman Liam McNeeley, UConn had to battle its way through every game in January. The No. 19 Huskies needed overtime to win at home against a Butler team with one Big East win. Just over a week later, the Huskies figured to have an easier team when a DePaul team that recently snapped a 39-game regular-season conference losing streak came to Connecticut. The Huskies had to overcome a 14-point deficit before winning by 11.",
      "That game was part of a stretch when the Huskies trailed by at least 10 points four times in seven games. Even the five wins in January were a bit of a grind.",
      "\u201cIt is stressful to play at UConn,\u201d coach Dan Hurley said. \"When you are not as good as we have been, it is uncharted territory for Alex (Karaban), Samson (Johnson), Hassan (Diarra), Solo (Ball), Jaylin (Stewart) and Jayden (Ross). They are not used to playing as many games like this, they are used to dominance. I think even the new guys \u2014 Tarris (Reed Jr.) and Aidan (Mahaney), it is a different kind of pressure when you play at a place like UConn.\"",
      "A turning point for UConn seemed to come late in the first half and the second half of the Jan. 29 game against DePaul. The Huskies used that momentum to look like a team that came into the season as one of the favorites to win the national title by winning at Marquette a few days later.",
      "\u201cIt helped us tremendously,\u201d Ball said. \u201cThe more we got to be together and work as one, it turned the game around. We had a big turnaround, we were down (14) in the first half and we ended up turning it around and winning by 11. The last 26 minutes were UConn basketball.\u201d",
      "More \"UConn basketball' was on display when the Huskies went on the road and won against a top-10 Marquette team in its first game in February. Even that game showed some of the flaws of this year's UConn team.",
      "The Huskies committed 25 turnovers and allowed Marquette to come down with 17 offensive rebounds. Led by a career-high 25 points from Ball, the Huskies shot 59% in the game and 63% on 3-pointers en route to the 77-69 victory.",
      "\u201cIt was a testament to the shooting numbers,\u201d Hurley said. \"There was a stretch in the second half when we weren\u2019t desperate enough or urgent enough. It has been the story of the season. These are things that we haven\u2019t done this year that our past teams have done.",
      "\u201cI am proud of the win but we don\u2019t play with that tenacity that our past teams have played with. We got bailed out by Solo had a crazy shooting night and Alex hit a late shot-clock (shot).\u201d",
      "Hurley thought it was going to be a struggle following the departures of Stephon Castle, Donovan Clingan, Tristen Newton and Cam Spencer. However, he didn't think the journey would be quite this bumpy.",
      "\u201cWhat we are trying to do is incredibly hard,\u201d Hurley said. \"The former national champs that went back-to-back, they returned their whole team or at least all the stars from their team. What we did last year going back-to-back with only returning two starters, nobody had done that before. Now we are trying to do something that has never been done before, it is not going to be easy.\"",
      "The good news is that McNeeley could be back when UConn plays at home against No. 12 St. John's on Friday night.",
      "\u201cWhen Liam was on the court, we were playing to a top-12 level,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cHis absence has caused a lot of problems for this team that this team can\u2019t overcome at this point. We just have to find a way to battle until we get whole again.\u201d",
      "With nearly a week off since the Marquette game, ailing point guard Diarra and McNeeley should be among the UConn players who will benefit additional recovery time.",
      "UConn went 3-5 in January during the 2022-23 season and turned things around in time to win the national title. Time will tell if the Huskies can follow that script once again.",

      "MILAN -- Next year\u2019s Winter Olympics might be called the Milan Cortina Games but they will actually be staged across a large swath of northern Italy.",
      "Covering an area of more than 22,000 square kilometres (nearly 10,000 square miles), the 2026 Games will be the most widespread Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics ever.",
      "And that\u2019s even if a trip across the Atlantic doesn\u2019t have to be factored in.",
      "If organizers aren't able to finish the sliding center in time, the backup plan is to host the bobsled, luge and skeleton events in Lake Placid, New York.",
      "The two main clusters of the Games are Milan \u2014 the beating heart of Italy's industrial north \u2014 and Cortina d'Ampezzo, a posh winter resort in the Dolomites mountain range, about 280 kilometres (170 miles) northeast of Milan.",
      "In addition, athletes will compete in three other mountain clusters, while the closing ceremony will be held in Verona, the largest city in the northeastern Veneto region.",

      "Here's a closer look at them:",
      "1. San Siro Stadium. The opening ceremony will be held in Milan\u2019s iconic 80,000-seat San Siro stadium.

      "The U.S. Open is the first major to publish a pathway for players from Saudi-funded LIV Golf",
      "The U.S. Open became the first major to publish a direct pathway for LIV Golf players, on Wednesday announcing a new exemption category that awards one spot to the leading player from among the top three at LIV\u2019s halfway point this year.",
      "The next exemption category will include one spot this year from the May 19 standings in LIV. Starting with the 2026 U.S. Open, the USGA will take the leading player in the final 2025 individual standings, along with the leading player from the May 18, 2026, list.",
      "In each case, the exemption goes to the leading player not already exempt, and the player must be among the top three in the standings.",
      "The other majors have not turned away players from the Saudi-backed LIV Golf League. The Masters has invited Joaquin Niemann each of the last two years, though Augusta National based that on his international play.",
      "The PGA Championship has invited LIV players based on their world ranking, and for 2024 at Valhalla it invited Talor Gooch, who had won three times on LIV the previous year. But the PGA of America does not have specific criteria, lumping LIV players and others into \u201cspecial invitations.\u201d Niemann and Sergio Garcia already have received PGA invitations this year.",
      "For this year\u2019s U.S. Open, an exemption from qualifying will be given \u201cthe top player who is not otherwise exempt and in the top three\" of the LIV individual standings as of May 19.",
      "That could mean no one gets that exemption if the leading three are already eligible. Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson, Richard Bland, Phil Mickelson and Cameron Smith are LIV players currently exempt.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pleased that the USGA has formally created a new exemption for LIV Golf players to compete in the U.S. Open and appreciate Mike Whan\u2019s leadership and commitment to growing the game of golf,\" said Scott O'Neil, the new CEO of LIV Golf.",
      "\u201cEvery golf fan in the world longs to see the greatest players in the world competing on golf\u2019s biggest stages at the majors,\u201d O'Neil said. \"LIV Golf is committed to working hand in hand with golf\u2019s governing bodies to elevate the sport in all corners of the world.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Open is June 12-15 at Oakmont Country Club in the Pittsburgh suburbs.",
      "\u201cThe USGA continues to evaluate the pathways that exist to ensure those playing their best have the opportunity to compete in our national championship,\u201d said John Bodenhamer, the USGA chief championships officer.",
      "\u201cConsistent with our historical approach, we continuously evaluate talent levels on professional tours and in amateur events, which has led us to add a new exemption category.\u201d",
      "In addition to the new category, the USGA will offer exemptions from the first stage of 18-hole qualifying starting next year to the top 10 players on the LIV points list on April 7, 2026. Five LIV events will have been played by then.",
      "LIV begins its fourth season on Thursday under the lights at Riyadh Golf Club in Saudi Arabia, equipped with its first network deal with Fox Sports. It also has events scheduled for Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Miami and South Korea before the U.S. Open exemption deadline.",
      "Players from the breakaway league always have been able to go through qualifying \u2014 four LIV players made it through U.S. Open qualifying last year. But having a set target could be seen as a boost, particularly to young players who have no status on established tours.",
      "Among the young players who joined LIV Golf this year are Tom McKibbin of Northern Ireland, Frederik Kjettrup of Denmark, Luis Masaveu of Spain and Yubin Jang of South Korea.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Vic Fangio's coaching career started in the 1970s as a high school assistant in Pennsylvania and has taken him across the country in various stops as he grew into one of the most innovative defensive coaches in the game.",
      "Now at age 66, Fangio is at the Super Bowl in New Orleans, where he started his NFL coaching career, as defensive coordinator with the Philadelphia Eagles team he grew up supporting with a chance to fill one of the few remaining gaps on a stellar career.",
      "\u201cI grew up a Philadelphia sports fan,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cPhillies, Eagles, Sixers, started my pro career in Philadelphia with the USFL. And now I\u2019ll probably end it here one of these years. It\u2019s kind of come full circle. ... I kind of fit there.\u201d",
      "Fangio has incorporated eight new starters into a defense that ranked near the bottom of the NFL in 2023 and turned it into one of the league's best as the Eagles led the NFL in advanced efficiency metrics and allowed the second-fewest points in the league.",
      "He is a major reason why the Eagles are in the Super Bowl, giving Fangio the success he couldn't achieve in a failed head coaching stint in Denver and a chance to win his first Super Bowl in 38 seasons in the NFL.",
      "\u201cI still really like to do it. I think I\u2019m still halfway decent at it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great. If you hang around long enough the tide will turn.\u201d",
      "Fangio began his NFL career coaching one of the top linebacking groups ever for New Orleans' \u201cDome Patrol\u201d teams in 1986 and got his first chance as defensive coordinator for expansion Carolina in 1995.",
      "He has spent nearly all of his time since in the NFL, with a one-year break to go to Stanford, and his defensive style that disguises coverages and tries to keep two safeties as deep as possible to limit big plays has been mimicked throughout the league.",
      "His only previous trip to the Super Bowl came in the 2012 season with San Francisco, when he lost to Baltimore here at the Superdome.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk about coaches, sometimes you're like \u2018He\u2019s been a good coach for years.\u2019 He\u2019s very good coach for decades, which is impressive,\u201d Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s had an unbelievable career and done so many good things and just so grateful that he\u2019s on the staff. He has the standard of how it\u2019s supposed to look and holds the guys to that standard. He\u2019s not afraid to tell you what he thinks if you don\u2019t meet the standard and praise you if you do meet the standards.\u201d",
      "Fangio has been integral in the defensive rebuild in Philadelphia. He saw enough in free agent Zack Baun to turn him from a special teams player who got limited time on defense as an outside rusher in New Orleans into an All-Pro inside linebacker and finalist for AP Defensive Player of the Year in Philadelphia.",
      "He also helped incorporate two rookie starters in the secondary in Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean, which played a big part in the turnaround.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s like a father figure,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to hold you accountable. He\u2019s serious. But he\u2019s got jokes too. He\u2019s funny as well.\"",
      "But Fangio will face his toughest test on Sunday when the Eagles face Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs.",
      "While much has been made out of Fangio's 0-8 record against Mahomes as a head coach in Denver and play-caller in Miami, he never had a defense as talented as this one when he faced him.",
      "The record diminishes what Fangio did on defense as his teams scored just 11.9 points per game in those games. Fangio's defenses allowed only 21.6 points per game to the Kansas City offense \u2014 the Chiefs got six additional TDs on defense and special teams \u2014 and Mahomes threw only 10 TD passes in the eight games and had a lower passer rating (95.9) and yards per attempt (7.3) than his career average.",
      "\u201cEvery time I've played Coach Fangio, there's been different changeups and different things he's thrown at us,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cThat's what makes him so great. He won\u2019t do what he did the last time.\u201d",
      "Mahomes called games against Fangio a \"chess match\" and Fangio stressed the importance of changing up schemes because of Mahomes' \u201celite\u201d ability to understand what a defense is doing both before the snap and after.",
      "\u201cThere is no secret. This is his seventh year as a starter. No one has gotten the formula to beat him,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cHe\u2019s won the chess match against me, the final score. We\u2019ll see if there's something we can come up with.\u201d",

      "Tom Brady addressed questions about his move to broadcasting as well as other issues on Wednesday during a conference call previewing Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl 59 matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles",
      "Even though the scoreboard won\u2019t measure Tom Brady\u2019s performance in the Fox Sports booth during Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl, he is trying to take the same approach that he did in his previous 10 appearances in the big game as a player.",
      "Brady addressed questions about his move to broadcasting as well as other issues on Wednesday during a conference call previewing Sunday\u2019s matchup in New Orleans between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles.",
      "It was the first time Brady was made available for interviews. He has frequently appeared during the season on Colin Cowherd\u2019s show on FS1.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no scoreboard for us. Did we feel we approached the game the right way, and were we prepared? Ultimately, it comes down to two things: Was I confident in what I said, and did I enjoy myself? I think if those are yes, then we did a good job,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI\u2019m very excited for what\u2019s ahead.\u201d",
      "Brady has received as much scrutiny as an analyst as he did during his 23 seasons quarterbacking the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he won seven Super Bowls.",
      "While the general consensus is that his first year in the booth has not been as good as Tony Romo\u2019s with CBS in 2017, Brady hasn\u2019t struggled as other former players and coaches who have attempted broadcasting.",
      "Kevin Burkhardt, who is calling his second Super Bowl, said he has noticed Brady\u2019s comfort level improve as the season progresses.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a reason that not everybody dives into this end of the pool because it\u2019s hard to be on TV for 3 1/2 hours every week and not have an edit button and go back and hit the delete button,\u201d Burkhardt said.",
      "\"I think the goal the whole way along was for us as a team to grow and get better as the year goes on. I think with anybody new, and I\u2019ve worked with enough new partners over the years, it takes time to build chemistry, whether they\u2019re a TV veteran or not, and I think with this, it\u2019s no different. It just takes time on task. So I\u2019m just proud of where we are.\"",
      "Brady signed a 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox in May 2022 while still playing for Tampa Bay. He retired after that season and decided in February 2023 to take a year off before moving into the booth.",
      "Burkhardt and Brady had plenty of practice games during the season, but those took place mostly on the Fox Sports lot in Los Angeles and not viewed by millions. Brady, though, knew that the learning curve was going to be steep, but he was ready for the challenge.",
      "\u201cTo use your voice and vision for a live television audience, there\u2019s a lot of adrenaline in that, but it was very different from when I played. I would probably see all these things, I didn\u2019t have to verbalize them,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI knew subconsciously what to do, and my body just took over because that\u2019s how I trained it. When you embrace the uncertainty, you work as hard as you can to prepare yourself, knowing that you\u2019re going to wish you had done some things over. I\u2019ve enjoyed the learning curve.",
      "\u201cI love the ability to take the viewer inside of just the way that I see things. In some ways, it\u2019s very simple. In some ways, it\u2019s very complicated. I feel as a crew, we\u2019re all hitting our stride. We know each other better every week. Hopefully, this is our best game yet.\u201d",
      "Brady noted that along with feedback he has received from Fox Sports, Romo, NBC\u2019s Cris Collinsworth and Amazon Prime Video\u2019s Al Michaels have reached out.",
      "Along with Brady\u2019s approach to games as an analyst, there have also been questions about his dual roles in calling games and having a 5% stake as a limited owner in the Las Vegas Raiders.",
      "The NFL put rules in place not allowing Brady to participate in Fox\u2019s production meetings with teams \u2014 either in person or via Zoom \u2014 watch practices, or step foot in a team\u2019s training complex.",
      "Fox Sports president of production and operations/executive producer Brad Zager said in an interview with The Associated Press last month that any inferences about a potential conflict of interest between Brady calling games and being part of the Raiders\u2019 decision-making process are unfounded.",
      "Brady will be allowed this week to attend production meetings with Chiefs and Eagles players and coaches. He will not be able to view practices.",
      "Brady said that not being allowed in production meetings this season has not affected his research when preparing for games, even though there are other benefits he misses.",
      "\u201cI think the best part (of production meetings) is there are just genuine relationships that get built up over time, and it\u2019s a shared experience with people on your own crew sitting on calls and talking,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFrom a research standpoint, I listen to press conferences all week. To me, there\u2019s no difference in a media member asking a question on a Wednesday, Thursday or Friday press conference that would be any different from any of the questions I would ask or the crew would ask.\u201d",
      "Brady did not directly say how much of a role he took in the Raiders hirings of head coach Pete Carroll, general manager John Spytek, and offensive coordinator Chip Kelly. Owner Mark Davis recently said that Brady had helped lead a committee that brought Carroll and Spytek to the Raiders.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m there to support the team, the leadership, and the overall vision for success,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThis approach as a broadcaster has been all-encompassing this year. And the reality is that Mark Davis is the owner of the Raiders and I play a supportive, complementary role to the vision that he sets. And that will happen in its own time and place.\u201d",
      "While Brady\u2019s Patriots fell short in their quest for three straight Super Bowls, he said he would be happy to see Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs be the first team in the Super Bowl era to accomplish that feat.",
      "It would also be the fourth championship for Mahomes, putting him closer to Brady and a title record that few thought could be reached when he retired.",
      "\u201cI love seeing other people achieve great things and for people to detract from anything Patrick is doing, I don\u2019t believe will ever detract from what I accomplished in my career,\u201d Brady said.",
      "\u201cThe reality is we all have our journeys. The comparisons are fun naturally for the media because it serves a different perspective and context that people can write and talk about. But as a competitor that I was, I never viewed it that way, and I still don\u2019t today, even in the role that I am now.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 12:44:16 -0500",
    "summary": "It makes sense that Black players in the NFL think Black head coaches feel extra pressure",
    "story": [
      "It makes sense that Black players in the NFL think Black head coaches feel extra pressure",
      "Baltimore Ravens safety Kyle Hamilton took note when two of the three Black first-year full-time head coaches in the NFL were fired: Jerod Mayo by the New England Patriots immediately after the final regular-season game, and Antonio Pierce by the Las Vegas Raiders two days later.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to make it a bigger thing than it is, but at the same time, yeah, it is tough to see coaches who are minorities and earned that job, and respected retired athletes, as well \u2014 obviously sad to see those guys go,\" Hamilton said in the wake of those changes. \u201cBlack coaches may have a shorter leash.\"",
      "More than 90% of the 65-plus Black NFL players surveyed by The Associated Press over the past seven months were encouraged to have seen the number of Black head coaches in the league rise to seven last offseason. But with the departures of Mayo and Pierce, and the hiring of Aaron Glenn by the New York Jets, that number is back down to six, pending the New Orleans Saints' choice for the last opening.",
      "Something several players mentioned \u2014 most before Pierce (who originally coached on an interim basis) and Mayo lost their jobs 17 games into the full-fledged gig \u2014 was a sense that Black coaches who get a shot need to be successful right away or risk being gone quickly.",
      "\u201cSometimes,\u201d Chargers linebacker Chris Rumph observed, \u201cthey put them in positions where they don\u2019t give them time.\u201d",
      "That, in turn, creates added pressure in a role that already comes with plenty of it.",
      "\"As they get hired, do they have the leeway to turn a program around? Rather than starting brand new and saying, \u2018You\u2019ve got a year, that\u2019s the end of it,'\u201d said Pittsburgh Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward, who has played his entire 14-year career for Mike Tomlin.",
      "\u201cYou see it around the league, sometimes: It is surprising when some coaches get fired,\" Heyward said. \"You're like, \u2018Man, if they had just stayed with the program and built it up, it could have been something.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since 2000, according to an AP tally, eight of the league's 19 head coaches \u2014 42% \u2014 who were fired after their first full season were Black.",
      "In that same span, 31 of 173 new NFL head coaches \u2014 18% \u2014 were Black.",
      "\u201cI like to try to think optimistically and think that if a Black head coach either doesn\u2019t get the opportunity or gets fired, it\u2019s because he wasn\u2019t as qualified as the next candidate or he just didn\u2019t get the job done \u2014 versus the color of his skin being relevant,\u201d Washington Commanders receiver Terry McLaurin said. \u201cUnfortunately enough, I feel that, sometimes, Black head coaches or Black coaching candidates might have to prove themselves a little more just to get that opportunity or just to stay in the job.\u201d",
      "Ronnie Stanley, a Ravens offensive lineman who's played nine years of professional football, was among the nearly 40% of the players who told the AP they have thought about trying to coach.",
      "He said the scarcity of jobs and track record of brief tenures means it \u201cmakes 100% sense\u201d that Black coaches who get a chance to run a club in the pros would find themselves feeling on the spot.",
      "\u201cYou have to be in a good place, where whoever is in charge of you has to understand that position and not put more undue pressure,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cThere\u2019s enough pressure there on that position.\u201d",
      "Players also raised the issues of representation \u2014 and, possibly, connection \u2014 when discussing a league in which more than 50% of the athletes are Black and about 20% of the coaches are.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the color of your skin dictates how good of a coach you are. But it would be na\u00efve to think that a Black coach, especially in a Black-dominated profession, wouldn\u2019t understand some things about another Black person that the best white head coaches would never understand \u2014 from upbringings to mentalities to family dynamics. Those are just things you can\u2019t quantify,\" Washington's McLaurin said.",
      "\u201cDoes that equate to wins and losses? That\u2019s up in the air,\u201d he said. \"But having more candidates who can relate to players on different scales, not just football, is extremely important.\u201d",
      "Brandon Brown, the director of The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES), which publishes gender and race report cards grading various leagues, understands why NFL players would notice \u2014 and maybe be bothered by \u2014 the percentages of athletes vs. head coaches.",
      "\u201cRepresentation and identification is extremely important. It becomes even more of an issue when there\u2019s a drastic misrepresentation from a player\u2019s perspective. Wanting to interact with like-minded people is fair for any walk of life. That just goes with any part of society,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe players have a right to \u2026 want to have more representation.\u201d",

      "Shiffrin announced that she needs more time for training as she regains her form from a deep puncture wound and won't be entering the new team combined event at worlds.",
      "Vonn, who returned to the circuit this season at age 40 after nearly six years of retirement, had been campaigning for a spot alongside Shiffrin in the event, which involves one squad member racing downhill and another racing slalom. The times of the two athletes on each team are added together to determine the results.",
      "While Shiffrin returned last week and placed 10th in a slalom in Courchevel, France, after nearly two months out following a crash in Killington, Vermont, she said she's \u201ccontinuing to take it one step at a time as I work to get back to 100%\u201d and that \u201ceach day so far has come with a new set of challenges.\"",
      "\u201cWith that said, I need to keep my energy focused on preparing for the giant slalom and slalom races during world championships, and will not be able to participate in the team combined,\u201d Shiffrin said on her social media accounts.",
      "The women\u2019s team combined event is scheduled for next Tuesday \u2014 two days before the women\u2019s giant slalom and four days before the women\u2019s slalom.",
      "Shiffrin and Vonn are the winningest female racers in World Cup history with 99 victories for Shiffrin and 82 for Vonn. Vonn is the all-time leader in World Cup downhill victories with 43 and Shiffrin holds the mark in slalom with 62 \u2014 both records among men and women.",
      "\u201cI think it would be probably one of the coolest things in ski racing to have 181 World Cup victories on one team,\u201d Vonn said Monday, before Shiffrin's announcement. \u201cI don\u2019t see how that wouldn\u2019t be incredible. I don\u2019t know how she is physically, I haven\u2019t talked to her because she just came back. So I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s even competing in the combined. But if there is a chance to compete with her, I would absolutely love to.\u201d",
      "Vonn could now pair with Paula Moltzan instead. Both Vonn and Moltzan grew up skiing at Buck Hill in Minnesota and Vonn was Moltzan's hero.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re from the same small town,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cThat would be really cool to race with her. But I would be happy with any of my teammates to compete with.\u201d",
      "Vonn and Shiffrin could still team up in combined at next year\u2019s Milan-Cortina Olympics. Thursday marks exactly one year before the Feb. 6, 2026 opening ceremony.",
      "Vonn told The Associated Press in a recent interview that the main goal of her return is to race in Cortina at the 2026 Games and that then she will retire again.",
      "Vonn will race in the super-G and downhill at worlds on Thursday and Saturday.",

      "TOKYO -- Toyota is developing and making electric vehicles and EV batteries in China, the Japanese automaker said Wednesday, under a new partnership with the Shanghai government.",
      "Toyota Motor Corp. also announced it will start producing batteries for EVs, hybrids and plug-ins at a new $14 billion facility in North Carolina, with shipping starting for North American models in April.",
      "The moves highlight Toyota\u2019s aggressive push in electric cars, a sector where some critics have said it\u2019s fallen behind rivals like Tesla and BYD at a time when the Chinese EV market is booming and the world's concerns about sustainability are increasingly crucial.",
      "Toyota is setting up a company in Jinshan district in southwest Shanghai for that effort, with production of the new Lexus EVs starting in 2027.",
      "Initial production capacity there totals 100,000 vehicles a year, which will create about 1,000 jobs, the world\u2019s top automaker said. The battery plant in the U.S. will create some 5,000 jobs, according to Toyota.",
      "Toyota\u2019s push also comes as worries grow around Asia about a potential trade war brewing after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliated with tariffs to take effect next week.",
      "\u201cWe have always tried to be a company that will be loved wherever we do our business. That has never waffled,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Yoichi Miyazaki told reporters without addressing the tariffs.",
      "Also Wednesday, Toyota reported fiscal third quarter profit jumped 61% from the previous fiscal year to 2.19 trillion yen ($14 billion), on 12.4 trillion yen ($81 billion) sales, up 3% on-year.",
      "Toyota officials said sales were recovering from the drop earlier this fiscal year after some production was suspended over a certification scandal in Japan.",
      "Last year, Toyota acknowledged wide-ranging fraudulent testing, including the use of inadequate or outdated data in crash tests, incorrect testing of airbag inflation and engine power checks. The wrongdoing did not affect the safety of the vehicles, and only affected production in Japan.",
      "Toyota revised its profit forecast for the full fiscal year through March 2025 to 4.5 trillion yen ($29 billion) from the previous projection for a 3.6 trillion yen ($24 billion) profit, thanks to the positive effect of the foreign exchange rate and cost reduction efforts. The new projection still falls short of what Toyota racked up the previous fiscal year at 4.9 trillion yen.",
      "The new company in China is part of Toyota\u2019s drive to meet the high demand for EVs in China, according to Toyota. Toyota already has China FAW Group Co. and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. as its longtime partners in China, and those will continue unchanged, he said.",
      "Toyota said it hopes to contribute to the Chinese government\u2019s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.",
      "\u201cLocal Chinese members will take the lead in planning and developing BEVs that match the unique needs of Chinese customers. Our goal is to become a company that is more loved and supported by the people of China,\u201d said Miyazaki.",

      "It's a recipe you can test for yourself \u2014 though the timing isn't ideal with soaring egg prices in the United States from a bird flu outbreak.",
      "The perfect boiled egg has a velvety yolk paired with a soft, solid white.",
      "Achieving this balance can be a challenge because the yolk cooks at a lower temperature than the white. Hard boiling an egg can yield a chalky yolk, while cooking low and slow can produce jelly-like, undercooked whites.",
      "Researchers cooked hundreds of eggs and used math to tackle this runny conundrum. One equation dealt with how heat travels between a hot surface and an egg; another captured how the egg's contents morph from liquid to solid with a gel-like state in between.",
      "Their final recipe involves transferring eggs in a steamer basket every two minutes between two bowls of water \u2014 one boiling and the other lukewarm at 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) \u2014 for a total of 32 minutes before cooling under running water and peeling.",
      "\u201cYou could definitely do this at home with half a dozen eggs or so,\" said Gregory Weiss, a chemist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved with the research.",
      "In the method proposed by the researchers, dubbed periodic cooking, the egg whites heated and cooled until fully set. The yolk, on the other hand, held firm at a constant temperature and cooked until creamy.",
      "\u201cYou can almost spread it, like on bread,\u201d said study author Emilia Di Lorenzo from the University of Naples Federico II.",
      "To confirm they had cooked up something new, the researchers tested the chemical makeup of the prepared eggs and served them to a panel of eight tasters alongside traditional boiled eggs.",
      "The research was published Thursday in the journal Communications Engineering.",
      "This new technique could mean more time in the kitchen compared to a standard hard-boiled egg, said food scientist Joanne Slavin from the University of Minnesota. But the blend of textures on the tongue could be worth the extra time.",
      "\u201cThis is a slower process to get a better outcome,\u201d said Slavin, who had no role in the study.",

      "Google is scrapping some of its diversity hiring targets, joining a lengthening list of U.S. companies that have been abandoning or scaling back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google is scrapping some of its diversity hiring targets, joining a lengthening list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "The move, which was outlined in an email sent to Google employees on Wednesday, came in the wake of an executive order issued by President Donald Trump that was aimed in part at pressuring government contractors to scrap their DEI initiatives.",
      "Like several other major tech companies, Google sells some of its technology and services to the federal government, including its rapidly growing cloud division that\u2019s a key piece of its push into artificial technology.",
      "Google's parent company, Alphabet, also signaled the shift in its annual 10-K report it filed this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In it, Google removed a line included in previous annual reports saying that it\u2019s \u201ccommitted to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.\u201d",
      "Google generates most of Alphabet's annual revenue of $350 billion and accounts for almost all of its worldwide workforce of 183,000.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities, and over the last year we\u2019ve been reviewing our programs designed to help us get there,\" Google said in a statement to The Associated Press. \"We\u2019ve updated our 10-K language to reflect this, and as a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes required following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic.\u201d",
      "The change in language also comes slightly more than two weeks after Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other prominent technology executives \u2014 including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 stood behind Trump during his inauguration.",
      "Meta jettisoned its DEI program last month, shortly before the inauguration, while Amazon halted some of its DEI programs in December following Trump's election.",
      "Many companies outside of the technology industry also have backed away from DEI. Those include Walt Disney Co., McDonald's, Ford, Walmart, Target, Lowe's and John Deere.",
      "Trump's recent executive order threatens to impose financial sanctions on federal contractors deemed to have \u201cillegal\u201d DEI programs. If the companies are found to be in violation, they could be subject to massive damages under the 1863 False Claims Act. That law states that contractors that make false claims to the government could be liable for three times the government\u2019s damages.",
      "The order also directed all federal agencies to choose the targets of up to nine investigations of publicly traded companies, large non-profits and other institutions with DEI policies that constitute \u201cIllegal discrimination or preference.\u201d",
      "The challenge for companies is knowing which DEI policies the Trump administration may decide are \u201cillegal.\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order seeks to \u201cterminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs\u201d and other activities of the federal government, and to compel federal agencies \u201cto , combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.\u201d",
      "In both the public and private sector, diversity initiatives have covered a range of practices, from anti-discrimination training and conducting pay equity studies to making efforts to recruit more members of minority groups and women as employees.",
      "Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, has tried to hire more people from underrepresented groups for more than a decade but stepped up those efforts in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis triggered an outcry for more social justice.",
      "Shortly after Floyd died, Pichai set a goal to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in the Mountain View, California, company's largely Asian and white leadership ranks by 30% by 2025. Google has made some headway since then, but the makeup of its leadership has not changed dramatically.",
      "The representation of Black people in the company's leadership ranks rose from 2.6% in 2020 to 5.1% last year, according to Google's annual diversity report. For Hispanic people, the change was 3.7% to 4.3%. The share of women in leadership roles, meanwhile, increased from 26.7% in 2020 to 32.8% in 2024, according to the company's report.",
      "The numbers aren't much different in Google's overall workforce, with Black employees comprising just 5.7% and Latino employees 7.5%. Two-thirds of Google's worldwide workforce is made up of men, according to the diversity report.",

    "story": [
      "Smartphones are useful tools for everyday life but they\u2019re privy to nearly everything about you, including all the places you\u2019ve been",
      "LONDON -- Smartphones are useful tools for everyday life, but they're privy to nearly everything about you, including all the places you've been \u2014 if you let them.",
      "When you use a map app to find the new restaurant your friend recommended, or your phone's browser to check the price of something you saw while window shopping, you could be unwittingly allowing your phone to track your location and share that information with others.",
      "Phones use various signals to find your location, including cell tower pings, Wi-Fi access points, Bluetooth and GPS.",
      "Sometimes your phone needs to know your location to provide a useful service, like telling the Uber driver where to pick you up. But in other cases, there\u2019s little justification for tracking your whereabouts, which then can be exploited by apps, ad services or even hackers.",
      "\u201cFrom fitness tracking to navigation, every location ping potentially reveals details about our routines and movements \u2013 which could be risky in the wrong hands,\" said Darren Guccione, CEO of Keeper Security. \u201cUsers should turn on location tracking only when necessary, such as during navigation, emergencies or sharing updates with trusted contacts, and disable it immediately afterward.\"",
      "Experts warn location data could be used to track people who visit abortion clinics. Or \"a disgruntled ex could use location sharing to stalk someone, or a current, abusive partner could force you into location sharing as a means of control,\u201d said David Ruiz, senior privacy advocate at cybersecurity company Malwarebytes.",
      "Here are some tips to make sure location tracking is kept to a minimum:",
      "Head to your phone's control panel to check permissions.",
      "iPhone users can go to the Privacy & Security tab, and then to Location Services to check settings for individual apps. It's not a good idea to let apps always use your location in the background, according to cybersecurity experts. Instead, get the app to either ask first before using your location, use it only while you've got the app open, or even never let it use your location.",
      "While you're in Location Services, you might notice little arrows that indicate which apps have used your location. Purple means recently, while grey indicates the past 24 hours.",
      "It's a little different for Android phones because there are so many different versions by various device manufacturers. In general, go to settings, and then tap the Location icon, which lets you turn it on or off for all apps.",
      "To tweak settings for individual apps, tap App location permissions, where you'll get choices similar to those in iOS.",
      "Apple has other tools to cut down on third-party tracking that might include location information. On the iPhone's Privacy & Security setting, under the Tracking tab, there's a toggle to Allow Apps to Request to Track. With this switched off, any new app requests will be automatically denied and they will also be stopped from accessing your phone's ad identifier.",
      "Privacy experts recommend blocking your Google or Apple device\u2019s in-house ad identifier, which enables third-party tracking on most devices for better ad targeting.",
      "On iPhones, go to the Privacy setting then scroll down to Apple Advertising, and then switch off Personalized Ads. On newer Android phones, go to the Privacy setting, then to Ads, where you can tap Delete Advertising ID.",
      "Whether you use Android or iOS, they both have settings to allow precisely pinpointing your location by combining wireless signals with data from onboard sensors such as the gyroscope, accelerometer and barometer. This helps to estimate the phone's position if, for example, you're inside a building blocking a GPS signal.",
      "One reason to use this function is to show someone you're meeting exactly where you are. Google says its signals are randomized so they can\u2019t be associated with a specific person or account. In any case, you might not want every app to know this, so you can tell your phone to only share its general location.",
      "On Android phones, turn off the Location Accuracy setting for all apps. On iPhones, switch it on or off for individual apps.",
      "Along with app permissions for your device, it's also a good idea to check your Google account. Google was forced to be more transparent about its location tracking practices after a 2018 Associated Press story that found the company continued to track people\u2019s location data even after they opted out of such tracking by disabling a feature the company called \u201clocation history.\u201d",
      "Go to myaccount.google.com and then to the Data & Privacy section, where you'll find the Location History controls. Under recent changes, the history will be deleted after three months, though you can change that default setting.",
      "Popular smartphone web browsers like Safari or Chrome could give away your location, so try using one that that doesn't store information about you, like DuckDuckGo, Firefox Focus or Ecosia.",
      "If a privacy-focused browser needs to access your location through your IP address, they will ask first. It will also let you easily delete your cookies and other web browsing data.",
      "Phones or tablets can also be tracked with Apple's Find My or Google's Find My Device features for recovering lost devices. You can turn this feature off if you think someone has gained access to your Apple or Google account.",
      "Some cybersecurity websites recommend using airplane mode, but it doesn\u2019t always shut off all signals so you shouldn't rely on it.",
      "A signal-blocking Faraday pouch would be a better bet, but be sure to test it to make sure it's actually jamming all signals. And, keep in mind, you'll need to take the device out of the bag to use it.",
      "There are so many possible ways for smartphones \u2014 and other devices like smartwatches \u2014 to track our location that it's hard to provide an exhaustive checklist.",
      "Our default relationship with apps, companies, and platforms is for them to track us, \"which absolutely makes it harder for us to scrutinize all the channels through which our data is being sent,\" said Ruiz.",
      "\u201cThe unfortunate truth is that, to shut everything down, we have to go into our device settings and check each app, line by line, and make individual decisions for how those apps collect our location data,\" said Ruiz. \u201cIt\u2019s either that, or turn off all location data entirely,\" which could result in inconveniences like having to manually enter your address on ride-hailing apps, or not getting live directions from mapping apps, he said.",

      "U.K. scientists say they have made a historic breakthrough by making the first image of the inside of a scroll carbonized by a volcanic eruption 2,000 years ago",
      "LONDON -- Scientists hope a mix of artificial intelligence and human expertise will help decipher ancient scrolls carbonized by a volcanic eruption 2,000 years ago.",
      "Hundreds of papyrus scrolls were found in the 1750s in the remains of a lavish villa at the Roman town of Herculaneum, which along with neighboring Pompeii was destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79.",
      "The library of what\u2019s called the Villa of the Papyri has the potential to add immeasurably to knowledge of ancient thought if the scrolls, which have been rolled up into the size of a candy bar, could be read.",
      "The heat and volcanic ash from Vesuvius destroyed the town and preserved the scrolls, but in an unreadable state, turning them into charred fragile blocks that disintegrate if unrolled physically.",
      "Scholars and scientists have worked for more than 250 years on ways to decipher the scrolls, the vast majority of which are held in the National Library of Naples.",
      "In 2023, several tech executives sponsored the \u201cVesuvius Challenge\u201d competition, offering cash rewards for efforts to decipher the scrolls with machine learning, computer vision and geometry.",
      "On Wednesday, the challenge announced a \u201chistoric breakthrough,\u201d saying researchers had managed to generate the first image of the inside of one of the three scrolls held at Oxford University\u2019s Bodleian Library.",
      "University of Kentucky computer scientist Brent Seales, co-founder of the Vesuvius Challenge, said the organizers were \u201cthrilled with the successful imaging of this scroll.\u201d He said it \u201ccontains more recoverable text than we have ever seen in a scanned Herculaneum scroll.\u201d",
      "The scroll was scanned by Diamond Light Source, a lab at Harwell, near Oxford, that uses a particle accelerator known as a synchrotron to create an intensely powerful X-ray.",
      "Scientists then used AI to piece together the images, search for ink that reveals where there is writing, and enhance the clarity of the text. The process led to a 3D image of the scroll that allowed experts to unroll it virtually, using a process called segmentation.",
      "AI, as it stands, has its limits. Little of the text has been deciphered so far. One of the few words that has been made out is the ancient Greek for \u201cdisgust.\u201d",
      "Scholars are being encouraged to join in the effort to complete the text.",
      "\u201cWe are still at the beginning of a long process,\u201d Peter Toth, the Cornelia Starks Curator of Greek Collections at the Bodleian, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe need better images, and they are very positive and very, very confident that they can still improve the image quality and the legibility of the text.\u201d",
      "Toth also laid out his hope that the technology can be made available locally so that the other two fragile scrolls won't have to be transported to Diamond\u2019s headquarters.",
      "\u201cMaybe there will be something which can be moved,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then don\u2019t forget that there is like 1000 more scrolls in Naples.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Researchers are in what one described as \u201ca mad scramble\u201d to sort out what public data the Trump administration has deleted from government websites and electronic publications.",
      "Late last week, federal agencies took down scores of government webpages as staffers hurried to comply with President Donald Trump\u2019s order rolling back protections for transgender people, which required the removal of \u201cgender ideology\u201d language from websites, contracts and emails.",
      "Some of the sites were back online Monday, but data analysts say it's not clear exactly what was removed or changed.",
      "\u201cYou go looking for something and it's just not there,\u201d said Amy O'Hara, a Georgetown University researcher who is president of the Association of Public Data Users.",

      "CDC officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The U.S. statistical system is considered the best in the world and researchers fear that the removals will undermine trust and put the integrity of the data at risk.",
      "\u201cThis sets a really dangerous precedent that any administration can come in and delete whatever they don\u2019t like,\u201d said Beth Jarosz, a senior program director at the Population Reference Bureau. \u201cRegardless of your politics, this should alarm you since this is taxpayer-funded data and it belongs to the public.\u201d",

      "An additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods took effect Tuesday, while the U.S. Postal Service announced it will stop accepting parcels inbound from China and Hong Kong until further notice.",
      "The previous day, President Donald Trump agreed to pause his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days following negotiations on Trump's demands for the North American nations to take steps to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",

      "The sheer volume and variety of the China-made merchandise sold in the U.S. means residents would probably see the prices of many typically inexpensive items tick higher if the tit-for-tat tariffs persist.",
      "These are some of the products most likely to be impacted:",
      "The U.S. imported about $427 billion worth of goods from China in 2023, the most recent year with complete data, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Consumer electronics, including cellphones, computers and other tech accessories, make up the biggest import categories.",
      "China is a dominant production engine for tech gear, including for American companies like Apple that have their products assembled in the country. In 2023, China accounted for 78% of U.S. smartphone imports and 79% of laptop and tablet imports, the Consumer Technology Association trade group reported.",
      "The tariffs also may affect how much consumers pay for typically inexpensive clothing, shoes and kitchen items like pots and pans, as well as the big-ticket items, such as appliances, furniture and auto parts.",

      "\u201cI knew the costs were going to go up, and these are manufactured in China,\u201d Salaytah said of a probe test light he purchased before Tuesday's tariff went into effect.",
      "In addition to imposing a new tariff on Chinese imports, Trump\u2019s executive order also suspended a little-known trade exemption that allowed goods worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. duty-free. The order left open the possibility for the loophole to still be used with shipments from other countries.",
      "The trade rule, known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d has existed for nearly a century. It came under greater scrutiny in recent years due to the rapidly growing number of low-cost items coming into the U.S. from China, mainly from prominent China-founded online retailers such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress.",
      "Former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed a crackdown on the loophole in September, but the rules did not take effect before Biden left office.",
      "Shein and Temu have gained global popularity by offering a quickly updated assortment of ultra-inexpensive clothes, accessories, gifts and gadgets shipped mostly from China, allowing the two e-commerce companies to compete on the home turf of American companies.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon is trying to compete with them through an online storefront that mimics their business model by offering cheap products shipped directly from China.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. In the U.S., Temu and Shein comprise about 17% of the discount market for fast fashion, toys and other consumer goods, the report said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear. Under de minimis, Shein, Temu and AliExpress could bypass taxes collected by customs authorities. But under the changes effective Tuesday, company shipments from China will now be subject to existing duties plus the new 10% tariff imposed by Trump, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of these orders are valued less than $800, which means all or virtually all of them are going to get caught in that,\u201d Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Financial, said.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, said he thinks the price increases on platforms like Shein and Temu will be \u201cpretty small\u201d and the products they sell will remain cheap. However, the rule change is likely to result in delivery delays since the packages now have to go through customs, Kaziukenas said.",
      "The new tariffs will also hit third-party sellers on Amazon that import products from China, according to Squali. He expects sellers to eat some of the costs and pass the rest onto customers, which he thinks could result in percentage price increases in the mid-single digits. Other e-commerce sites that host businesses, such as Etsy, are also going to be impacted, Squali said.",
      "Temu, which is owned by China\u2019s PDD Holdings, has previously said its growth did not depend on the de minimis policy. Though most of its products are shipped from China, Temu has been recruiting Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that experts said would allow it to not be as exposed to changes around the trade rule.",
      "In January, China also introduced measures to help cross-border e-commerce build overseas warehousing by offering them tax rebates or tax exemptions",
      "The day after November's U.S. presidential election, Brieane Olson, CEO of teen clothing chain PacSun, went to Hong Kong to meet with factory executives to figure out ways to prepare for Trump\u2019s tariff plan.",
      "Roughly 35% to 40% of PacSun\u2019s garments are made in China, even as the chain has accelerated moves to diversify with suppliers in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "But Olson said Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese goods was less extreme than the company anticipated. For now, PacSun doesn\u2019t plan to increase prices on its products or move its manufacturing of knitwear and denim out of China.",
      "Toys are another category of consumer products that relies heavily on imports from China. Greg Ahearn, the president and CEO of The Toy Association trade group, said he thinks toy companies that source in China are going to absorb the cost of the new tariff in the short term.",
      "Eventually, those price hikes will be moved onto the consumer, Ahearn said.",

      "HONG KONG -- China on Tuesday announced a flurry of retaliatory measures against the U.S., including tariffs on imports of products such as coal, liquefied natural gas products and crude oil, as well as an antitrust probe into Google. It also placed two other U.S. firms on an unreliable entity list that could bar them from investing in China.",
      "China and Google have had a long and entangled relationship going back to the early 2000s.",
      "Here's a look at Google's history in China and what the antitrust probe means for the company:",
      "Google launched Chinese-language search engine google.cn in 2006. It was censored to comply with Beijing\u2019s laws, and in 2009, was a major search engine in China with about 36% market share.",
      "In 2010, in response to a cyberattack and an increasing unwillingness to comply with censorship rules, Google said it was no longer willing to block search results and shut down its Chinese search engine, redirecting users to its Hong Kong site instead.",
      "Beijing later blocked Google services under its Great Firewall censorship system, including its email service Gmail, as well as its Chrome browser and search engine, making it inaccessible to users in mainland China.",
      "China typically blocks most Western internet platforms, such as Google, as well as social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Although Google services are not accessible in China, the company still maintains a presence in the country, primarily focused on sales and engineering for its advertising business. It also has employees working on services including Google Cloud and customer solutions.",
      "Google maintains offices in the major Chinese cities Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.",
      "China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it was investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws.",
      "While regulators did not provide further details, the announcement came minutes after the 10% tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump came into effect.",
      "As there are few details on what exactly Google is being investigated for, the immediate impact on Google operations is unclear, although its current status is unlikely to be affected by the probe, which could takes months.",
      "Google did not immediately comment on the investigation.",
      "Some experts believe that the antitrust investigation is likely to center around Google\u2019s Android operating system for smartphones and used as a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "John Gong, a professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics, said that the investigation could be related to Google\u2019s dominance in the Android business, as virtually all smartphone brands apart from Apple and Huawei would have to pay licensing fees to Google to use the Android system on their devices.",
      "\u201cNow, this time, Google is put on the chopping board. But I think it\u2019s still an investigation, right? It hasn\u2019t reached a decision yet,\u201d said Gong, adding, \"I think it\u2019s very much negotiable.\u201d",
      "Huawei developed its own HarmonyOS operating system after it was placed on the U.S. entity list \u2014 foreign individuals, companies and organizations deemed a national security concern \u2014 in 2019, which prevented it from doing business with U.S. firms including Google.",
      "Google has been accused of violating antitrust law in other countries, including those in the European Union, South Korea, Russia, India and Turkey, for allegedly abusing its market dominance.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google's digital ad sales continued to grow at a healthy clip during the holiday season, but that wasn't enough to offset investors' worries about whether its big bet on artificial intelligence will be lucrative as once envisioned.",
      "The October-December results released Tuesday by Google parent Alphabet Inc. showed the company is continuing to reap even more profits from its dominant search engine and other peripheral services.",
      "Alphabet earned $26.5 billion, or $2.15 per share, during last year\u2019s final quarter, a 28% increase from the same time during the previous year. Revenue rose 12% from the previous year to $96.5 billion. The earnings eclipsed analyst forecasts of $2.13 per share, but the revenue fell slightly below projections, according to FactSet Research.",
      "More importantly, revenue growth in the Google Cloud division tethered to the AI craze wasn't as robust as had been anticipated.",
      "That letdown contributed to a more than 8% drop in Alphabet's stock price after the numbers came out. The downturn reversed a recent rally that had elevated Alphabet's shares to a new all-time high earlier Tuesday during the regular trading session.",
      "\u201cThe reaction underscores concerns that rivals like Microsoft, with its OpenAI partnership, are better positioned to convert AI hype into revenue,\u201d said Investing.com analyst Jesse Cohen.",
      "But the AI-generated overviews that Google has been increasingly displaying in at the top of its search results appeared to be helping to bring in more advertising. Google's ad sales climbed 11% from the previous year to $72.5 billion to exceed analyst estimates.",
      "\u201cThe early signs suggest that AI is working for Google,\u201d said Jim Yu, CEO of BrightEdge, which helps websites rank higher in search results. \"What it does for Google is keep more of the digital experience happening within its search engine. And by the time they send someone to another site, shoppers and readers have already gotten further down their journey. So that visitor is worth a lot more to an advertiser.\u201d",
      "But Google also has spending billions of dollars on its AI expansion, a huge investment that some investors are questioning after t he Chinese startup DeepSeek found an effective way to deploy similar technology at a fraction of the cost. Alphabet is expecting its ongoing AI expansion to increase its capital from about $60 billion last year to $75 billion this year.",
      "Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sought to reassure investors all that spending will pay off during a Tuesday conference call by emphasizing the way AI is helping to boost Google's fortunes by attracting more search traffic and making other services more popular.",
      "\u201cThe company is in a great rhythm and cadence, building, testing and launching products faster than ever before,\u201d Pichai said.",
      "Before the fourth-quarter results came out, Google made a change that in its AI principles signaling it may be more open to selling the technology in areas that it had previously indicated it would avoid. The revised principles removed previous commitments not to deploy AI in weaponry or surveillance that had been in place since 2018. Pichai didn't address the change during Tuesday's conference call and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The uncertainty over AI isn't the only worry hanging over Google.",
      "The Mountain View, California, company also is facing a regulatory crackdown in the U.S., by far its most lucrative market, raising the specter that its revenue could be undercut.",
      "After weighing the evidence presented during a high-profile trial, a federal judge last year declared Google\u2019s search engine is an illegal monopoly \u2014 a decision that has opened the door for regulators to propose forcing the company to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Court hearings on how Google should be punished for its abuses in the search market are scheduled to begin in April, with a decision anticipated before autumn.",
      "Besides the legal assault on its search engine, Google also has been ordered  to tear down the barriers protecting its Play Store  for Android smartphone apps. That ruling is currently on hold while Google appeals. Google is also awaiting a ruling in antitrust trial in Virginia revolving around the technology underlying its digital ad network.",

      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- Elon Musk's lawyers faced off with OpenAI in court Tuesday as a federal judge weighed the billionaire's request for a court order that would block the ChatGPT maker from converting itself to a for-profit company.",
      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn't intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its transition from a nonprofit research laboratory to a for-profit corporation.",
      "But the judge also raised concerns about OpenAI and its relationship with business partner Microsoft and said she wouldn't stop the case from moving to trial as soon as next year so a jury can decide.",
      "\u201cIt is plausible that what Mr. Musk is saying is true. We\u2019ll find out. He\u2019ll sit on the stand,\u201d she said.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good. Musk had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer said Tuesday.",
      "Musk escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff.",
      "Also targeted by Musk's lawsuit is OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft and tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member who also sits on Microsoft's board.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers said she has a high bar for approving the kind of preliminary injunction that Musk wants but hasn't yet ruled on the request.",
      "She has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple's fight with Epic Games, though she said Tuesday that Musk's case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one. Then-President Barack Obama appointed her to the federal bench in 2011.",
      "Tuesday's hearing was originally set for January but was postponed after Musk's attorney Marc Toberoff said his house was destroyed in the Pacific Palisades wildfire.",
      "Musk, who did not attend the hearing, has alleged in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity.",
      "OpenAI has said Musk\u2019s requested court order would \u201cdebilitate OpenAI\u2019s business\u201d and mission to the advantage of Musk and his own AI company and is based on \u201cfar-fetched\u201d legal claims.",
      "At the heart of the dispute is a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "He had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "OpenAI has sought to demonstrate Musk\u2019s early support for the idea of making OpenAI a for-profit business so it could raise money for the hardware and computer power that AI needs.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google went to appeals court Monday in an attempt to convince a three-judge panel to overturn a jury's verdict declaring its app store for Android smartphones as an illegal monopoly and block the penalties imposed by a federal judge to stop the misbehavior. Video game maker Epic Games, which brought the case alleging Google's Play Store has been abusing its stranglehold over the Android app market, countered with arguments outlining why both the verdict and punishment should be affirmed to foster more innovation and lower prices.",
      "In a nearly hour-long presentation in San Francisco's Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Google lawyer Jessica Ellsworth explained why the company believes the judge overseeing a month-long trial in 2023 improperly allowed the market in its case to be defined differently than it had in a similar antitrust trial revolving around Apple's antitrust trial in 2021.",
      "Ellsworth also asserted the trial shouldn't have been decided by a jury in the first place because Google exercised its consent to that process and demanded the case be decided by a judge instead, as had the trial by Apple.",
      "Epic, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed separate antitrust cases against Apple and Google on the same day in August 2020 and culminated in dramatically different outcomes. Unlike the jury in Google's trial in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers largely sided with Apple in an 185-decision that defined the Play Store and Apple's iPhone app store as part of a broader competitive market.",
      "Ellsworth told the appeals court that U.S. District Judge James Donato improperly allowed Epic to turn the Google trial into a \u201cdo-over\u201d that excluded the Apple app store as a rival in the market definition that led to the jury's verdict in its case.",
      "\"You can't just lose an issue that was fully litigated the first time (in the Apple case) and then pretend it didn't happen,\" Ellsworth said. She said the competition that Google and Apple engage in while making the two operating systems that power virtually all of the world's smartphones \u201csufficiently disciplines\u201d their actions in the app market.",
      "But the appeals judges indicated they believed the market definitions could differ in the separate app store cases because Apple bundles all its software and the iPhone together \u2014 creating what has become known as a \u201cwalled garden\u201d \u2014 while Google licenses the Android software that includes its Play Store a wide variety of smartphone makers.",
      "\u201cThere are clearly some factual differences between the Android world and Apple world,\u201d Judge Danielle J. Forrest told Ellsworth.",
      "Judge Gabriel Sanchez also sounded skeptical about Google's claims about being lumped with an improper market definition in its trial.",
      "\u201cEven if Google vigorously competes with Apple (in smartphone operating systems), that doesn't mean it can't create a different ecosystem where it's a monopolist,\u201d Sanchez interjected during Ellsworth's presentation.",
      "Epic attorney Gary Bornstein painted Google's arguments as a desperate and unfounded effort to preserve the system that boosts Google's profits with price-gouging commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app purchases flowing from software downloaded through the Play Store.",
      "The penalties that Donato imposed in October and subsequently postponed while Google pursues its appeal would impose a series of sweeping changes that include making the Play Store's entire library of 2 million apps available to potential competitors \u2014 a move expected to result in lower commission rates.",
      "The appeals court hasn't set a timeline for issuing a ruling in the Play Store case, but it typically takes several months before a decision is reached.",
      "Google is also currently facing other potential penalties that could include being forced to sell its Chrome web browser after a judge in another antitrust trial ruled its ubiquitous search engine is an illegal monopoly, too.",
      "In Monday's two-hour hearing Bornstein contended that Google never tried to define the Android app market during the trial the way it presented it during its appeal and reminded the three-judge panel that the bar should be set high before reversing a jury's verdict and the ensuing punishment ordered by a lower court judge.",
      "\u201cThe benefit of the doubt does not go to the wrongdoer,\u201d Bornstein said.",
      "The judges seemed more troubled by Donato's decision to stick with a jury trial after the case changed shortly before the Epic trial when Google settled lawsuits brought by attorneys general across the U.S. and another prominent app developer, Match Group. An agreement for a jury trial had been reached when the attorneys general and Match cases were going to be combined with Epic's, but Google wanted to revert to having a judge decide the outcome after settling some of the claims only to be rebuffed by Donato.",
      "At one point during Bornstein's presentation, Forrest openly mused about the possibility of declaring the verdict as a decision rendered by the equivalent of an advisory jury and sending the case back to Donato for a more lengthy ruling.",
      "That is an approach favored by Ellsworth, who pointed out that the judge's ruling in the Apple app store case spanned nearly 200 pages while the jury in the Google trial \u201cwere asked eight questions and they offered 14 words defining a relevant market.\u201d",
      "But Bornstein urged the appeals court to resort to giving Donato a \u201chomework assignment\u201d that would give Google more time to profit from its illegal conduct.",

      "In Santorini\u2019s main town, Fira, the narrow, whitewashed streets along the island\u2019s clifftops were deserted \u2014 a rare sight even in the off season \u2014 except for small pockets of tour groups, many from Asian countries.",
      "Joseph Liu, from Guangzhou in southern China, said he had wanted to visit Santorini for years after seeing it in a documentary. He joined family and tour group members on a balcony deck typically used for high-end wedding receptions.",
      "\u201cThis place is amazing, really beautiful. Just like I saw in the program: the mystery, the scenery,\u201d he said. \u201cThe (group) leader told us about the earthquakes before we came so it was not a surprise.\u201d",
      "Retired police officer and ship worker Panagiotis Hatzigeorgiou, who has lived on Santorini for more than 30 years, said he has turned down offers to stay with relatives in Athens.",
      "\u201cOlder residents are used to the earthquakes ... But it\u2019s different this time. It\u2019s not the same to have earthquakes every 2-3 minutes. The main thing is not to worry,\u201d he said, adding with a laugh: \u201cNow we can listen to music alone and have coffee by ourselves.\u201d",
      "In Athens, government officials are continuing to hold daily high-level planning and assessment meetings with briefings from island officials.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- New research shows that when an asteroid slammed into the moon billions of years ago, it carved out a pair of grand canyons on the lunar far side.",
      "That's good news for scientists and NASA, which is looking to land astronauts at the south pole on the near, Earth-facing side untouched by that impact and containing older rocks in original condition.",
      "U.S. and British scientists used photos and data from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to map the area and calculate the path of debris that produced these canyons about 3.8 billion years ago. They reported their findings Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The incoming space rock passed over the lunar south pole before hitting, creating a huge basin and sending streams of boulders hurtling at a speed of nearly 1 mile a second (1 kilometer a second). The debris landed like missiles, digging out two canyons comparable in size to Arizona's Grand Canyon in barely 10 minutes. The latter, by comparison, took millions of years to form.",
      "\u201cThis was a very violent, a very dramatic geologic process,\u201d said lead author David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.",
      "Kring and his team estimate the asteroid was 15 miles (25 kilometers) across and that the energy needed to create these two canyons would have been more than 130 times that in the world\u2019s current inventory of nuclear weapons.",
      "Most of the ejected debris was thrown in a direction away from the south pole, Kring said.",
      "That means NASA\u2019s targeted exploration zone around the pole mostly on the moon's near side won\u2019t be buried under debris, keeping older rocks from 4 billion plus years ago exposed for collection by moonwalkers. These older rocks can help shed light not only on the moon\u2019s origins, but also Earth\u2019s.",
      "Kring said it\u2019s unclear whether these two canyons are permanently shadowed like some of the craters at the moon\u2019s south pole. \u201cThat is something that we\u2019re clearly going to be reexamining,\u201d he said.",
      "Permanently shadowed areas at the bottom of the moon are thought to hold considerable ice, which could be turned into rocket fuel and drinking water by future moonwalkers.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:14:26 -0500",
    "summary": "America&rsquo;s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
    "story": [
      "America\u2019s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
      "WEST ORANGE, N.J. -- Along the long road from American icon to endangered species and back again, the bald eagle \u2014 the national bird of the United States, often seen against a clear blue sky \u2014 is having a moment.",
      "The eagles find themselves in an environmental updraft of sorts since the early 2000's, when the federal government took the thriving birds off its endangered species list with more states following suit. Culturally, too, the animals are soaring.",
      "In December, Joe Biden signed legislation making the raptor the country's national bird (thought that was already the case? More in a bit). This month, New Jersey became the latest state to delist the bald eagle as endangered, citing a remarkable comeback for the creatures associated with strength and independence \u2014 and that occupied just a single nest in the state decades ago. And to the chagrin or elation of football fans, the Philadelphia Eagles will be vying for a championship in the Super Bowl this weekend.",
      "How did the storied birds find their way back? As with so many tales, it's complex.",
      "The story \u2014 there was a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the 1980s and roughly 300 now, for instance \u2014 centers on the banning of DDT, a chemical insecticide with environmental side effects that included thin-shelled eagle eggs. That touched off a cratering in the number of eagles across the country, and officials prohibited the pesticide in 1972.",
      "To rebuild the birds' numbers in their historic range across the country, conservationists imported birds from places where their populations were stable, including from Canada. Early on, they also removed eggs from nesting birds' nests, replacing them with artificial ones for the eagles to \u201cincubate\u201d while the real eggs were safely hatched outside the nest before being returned, as eaglets for their parents to raise according to Kathy Clark, the head of New Jersey's Endangered and Nongame Species Program.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that almost went extinct on our continent. And so I think now it\u2019s really important to make sure people know that story and learn from it,\u201d said Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation in Alaska.",
      "Clark, whose work with the birds spans decades and includes the period when their numbers were so small they lived only in a remote part of the state, said the eagles have taught officials a number of lessons. One is that they're \u201cfairly adaptable\" and now live across densely populated (with people) New Jersey \u2014 from suburban Bergen County near New York to the wetlands along the shore in the south.",
      "She recalled the story of one fledgling eagle in a suburban town \u2014 New York Giants territory, as it were, sorry, Eagles fans \u2014 that found itself on a backyard woodpile and walking around the street. Volunteer observers worried over the bird's well-being, given the realities of suburban living. But a year later, observers spotted the eagle, identified by a band. It had apparently made it.",
      "\u201cThose birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're Jersey birds. You got to have attitude, right?\u201d",
      "The birds do face dangers as they expand into suburbia, though. Jilian Fazio, director of the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo in suburban northern New Jersey, said the zoo rescues a number of birds hit by cars. One bird, a male named Freedom, perched atop a branch in his enclosure at the zoo recently and called out loudly. He was found dangling by a rope, left with an injury that renders him unreleasable, Fazio said.",
      "There are threats, as well. Habitat preservation and clean, open water, since the eagles feed heavily on fish, is a worry, but there's also the current outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu. Clark says officials are going to maintain surveillance amid the outbreak.",
      "Beyond the birds coming off endangered lists, they made headlines recently for finally getting their due as the county's national bird, an oversight left undone in law because the bald eagle was already on the national seal and many thought it already had that status, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who sponsored legislation that Biden signed last month.",
      "She and colleagues worked with Native American and veterans groups to get buy-in for the legislation, she said, and it passed the typically divisive House and Senate last year with no dissent. The birds are revered in a number of Native American cultures as symbols of strength, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, according to Paul Apodaca, a retired academic who specializes in folklore and mythology.",
      "The eagles' perch as symbols of the country contributes to their conservation, with experts considering them an \u201cumbrella species,\u201d whose need for large open spaces and waterways helps preserve lesser known wildlife.",
      "\u201cAmericans are always going to have that sort of personal relationship with bald eagles,\" Clark said.",
      "Experiencing seeing a bird in the wild or even as you're driving along a business-lined highway can leave an impression. Dan Day, a birder who's spotted bald eagles some 50 times in recent years both on nature walks and just driving around suburban New Jersey, remembered never having seen the birds as a kid growing up in Cleveland. Now a New Jersey resident and Philadelphia Eagles fan, he regularly goes out in his green \u201cBirds\u201d cap and binoculars.",
      "\u201cJust the mere thrill of seeing one \u2014 a lot of people just have never, ever looked at one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really elevates your day to see a bald eagle.\u201d",
      "Enjoy watching them, experts say, but give them space, too. Because rescuing animals threatened with extinction is expensive, uncertain work. Said Clark, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection official: \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever will lose that perspective of, of being on the brink there, not knowing if if you\u2019re going to be able to save the species.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 08:00:32 -0500",
    "summary": "The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States dropped dramatically this year even as federal officials move to extend protections for the beloved pollinator",
    "story": [
      "The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States dropped dramatically this year even as federal officials move to extend protections for the beloved pollinator",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States has dropped to its second-lowest mark in nearly three decades as pesticides, diminishing habitat and climate change take their toll on the beloved pollinator.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "Monarch butterflies, known for their distinctive orange-and-black wings, are found across North America. Monarchs in the eastern United States spend their winters in Mexico and are counted by the World Wildlife Fund, which has yet to release data for this year. Monarchs west of the Rocky Mountains typically overwinter along the California coast.",
      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced Friday that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997. The record-low was 1,901 monarchs in 2020.",
      "The survey noted that a site owned by The Nature Conservancy in Santa Barbara that saw 33,200 monarchs last winter hosted only 198 butterflies this year.",
      "Monarchs across the continent face mounting threats, chief among them vanishing milkweed, the host plant for the insect's caterpillars. The plant has been disappearing before a combination of drought, wildfires, agriculture and urban development, according to Monarch Joint Venture, a group that works to protect monarchs. Pesticides have contaminated much of the remaining plants, according to the Xerces Society.",
      "It's unclear what caused such a sharp drop-off in the western population in just one year, said Emma Pelton, an endangered species biologist with the Xerces Society. The monarch population is already small, she said, and triple-digit heat in the western states last year may have slowed breeding.",
      "Monarchs suffer when the mercury gets up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 Celsius) and any temperatures above 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42.2 degrees Celsius) are lethal to the insects, Pelton said. The western states saw a heat wave in July that drove temperatures in some areas well past 100 degrees. Palm Springs, for example, hit a record 124 degrees Fahrenheit (51.1 degrees Celsius) on July 5. Another heat wave cooked northern California in early October, with multiple cities breaking heat records.",
      "Pelton said that it's too early to tell what long-term impact the dramatic losses might have on the overall western monarch population. Insects do have the potential for exponential growth, Pelton said. After bottoming out at 1,901 butterflies in 2020, the population rebounded to 247,246 insects the following year, an increase of nearly 13,000%. The year after that the survey recorded 335,479 monarchs.",
      "\"This is bad news,\" Pelton said of the 2024 population drop. \u201cBut we have seen incredible recovery. this doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to have western monarchs. It's hopefully a wake-up call that a bad year can set them back pretty significantly.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced in December 2024 that it was working to list monarchs as threatened, a move that would prohibit anyone from killing, transporting them or making changes that would render their property permanently unusable for the species, such as eradicating all milkweed from the land. The listing also would protect 4,395 acres (1,779 hectares) in seven coastal California counties that serve as overwinter sites for western monarchs.",
      "A public comment period on the proposal is set to end in March. The agency has until December to officially list the monarch as threatened if officials decide to move forward.",
      "Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2024 to mandate testing pesticide effects on insects such as bees, moths and butterflies.",

      "Samoa\u2019s top health official has denounced as \u201ca complete lie\u201d remarks that Robert F",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Samoa\u2019s top health official on Monday denounced as \u201ca complete lie\u201d remarks that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made during his bid to become U.S. health secretary, rejecting his claim that some who died in the country's 2019 measles epidemic didn't have the disease.",
      "\"We don\u2019t know what was killing them,\" Kennedy said during tense U.S. Senate hearings last week on whether he should oversee the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, suggesting that the cause of the 83 deaths \u2014 mostly of children under age 5 \u2014 was unclear.",
      "\"It's a total fabrication,\u201d Samoa Director-General of Health Dr. Alec Ekeroma told The Associated Press of Kennedy's comments.",
      "U.S. senators grilled Kennedy last week over his 2019 Samoa trip, accusing him of downplaying his role in the epidemic.",
      "The outbreak devastated the Pacific island nation in 2019, killing 83 people in a population of 200,000. Vaccination rates were historically low because of poor public health management and the 2018 deaths of two babies whose vaccines were incorrectly prepared, prompting fears that the MMR immunization was unsafe before the nature of the error was discovered.",
      "The government suspended vaccinations for 10 months before the outbreak \u2014 the period when Kennedy visited. His trip was organized by a Samoan anti-vaccine influencer, according to a 2021 blog post by Kennedy.",
      "On Wednesday, Kennedy denied that his visit had fueled anti-vaccine sentiment. A spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.",
      "\u201cAnti-vaxxers from New Zealand came to be with him here,\u201d Ekeroma said. \u201cThat's how I know that his influence can be far-reaching.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen the tissue samples were sent to New Zealand, most of those people did not have measles,\u201d Kennedy told U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat.",
      "Ekeroma, a medical doctor who also holds a doctorate in health, said that the claim was a \u201chuge denial\u201d of the fact that doctors from several countries traveled to Samoa to treat measles patients.",
      "The Samoan official wasn't the health chief during the outbreak, but confirmed key details with his predecessor, he said. Only one autopsy was carried out and no postmortem tissue samples were sent abroad, which was not unusual because measles is a simple disease to diagnose, said Ekeroma.",
      "Blood samples from living patients were sent to Australia and New Zealand, where the public health agency said Monday that testing had confirmed the same strain of measles circulating in New Zealand at the time.",
      "\u201cI went there \u2013 nothing to do with vaccines,\u201d Kennedy said Wednesday. \u201cI went there to introduce a medical informatics system that would digitalize records in Samoa and make health delivery much more efficient.\u201d",
      "Ekeroma rejected that assertion, referring to social media posts by anti-vaccine advocates who posed for photos with Kennedy during his trip. One later wrote on the blog of Kennedy's then nonprofit, Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 which has decried MMR vaccines as unsafe \u2014 that during the outbreak he received advice from people assembled by Kennedy encouraging the alternative treatments he was supplying to Samoan families.",
      "In the same blog post, Kennedy recalled meeting Samoa's then prime minister, who he said was \u201ccurious to measure health outcomes following the \u2018natural experiment\u2019 created by the national respite from vaccines.\u201d",
      "In late 2019, Kennedy wrote to the leader, saying that the deaths could have been caused by a measles vaccine \u2014 statements he repeated in written responses to senators' questions following the hearing. He urged the Samoan leader to approach a particular laboratory to investigate the source of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cMy words had nothing to do with vaccine uptake in Samoa or with the 2019 epidemic,\u201d Kennedy said in his written responses.",
      "But Kennedy emboldened anti-vaccine contacts in Samoa, Ekeroma said, and the epidemic was fueled by disinformation in social media posts in the island nation and abroad.",
      "Moelagi Leilani Jackson, a Samoan nurse who worked on the vaccination campaign, told the AP in 2023 that anti-vaccine campaigners \u201cgot louder\u201d after Kennedy\u2019s visit.",
      "\u201cI feel like they felt they had the support of Kennedy,\u201d she said.",
      "However, Ekeroma said that Kennedy's overtures weren't heeded by the nation\u2019s leaders. A vaccination campaign resumed in 2019 and measles vaccines are now compulsory for Samoan children.",
      "If Kennedy is affirmed as the top U.S. health official this week, it would be \u201ca danger to us, a danger to everyone,\u201d Ekeroma said. Kennedy would control U.S. funding for vaccination initiatives and could make affordable vaccines harder for small nations like Samoa to access, the official said.",
      "\u201cIf he\u2019s going to be appointed, then we will have to actually discuss around the Pacific as to how we\u2019re going to try to neutralize his influence in the region,\u201d he added.",

      "With his 70th birthday looming on this year's horizon, Microsoft founder Bill Gates looked inward to open a window into the man behind Windows and other seminal software that turned the personal computer into a household staple.",
      "Gates focuses on the first quarter-century of his life in \u201cSource Code: My Beginnings,\u201d the opening installment in a retrospective trilogy about an insouciant, impertinent and often misunderstood kid who grew up to become a polarizing technology titan before morphing into an influential philanthropist.",
      "In \u201cSource Code,\u201d Gates explores how his childhood quirks, upbringing, friendships and experiences coalesced into shaping his own internal operating system. Along the way, he dissects his brain's unusual wiring, delves into the emotional trauma of his best friend dying while they were both in high school, and revisits the birth of Traf-O-Data, a trailblazing startup that he launched in Albuquerque, New Mexico with another childhood friend, Paul Allen.",
      "Traf-O-Data, conceived to create software for the groundbreaking Altair computer made Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, became Microsoft in 1975 \u2014 a year it booked $16,005 in revenue while Gates and Allen were making $9 per hour.",
      "By 1977, Microsoft had become successful enough to embolden Gates to drop out of Harvard University. In 1979, he had decided to move Microsoft to the Seattle area where he grew up. Although Gates stepped down as Microsoft's CEO 25 years ago, the Windows operating system and other software created under his reign remain the main pillar in a company that now generates $212 billion in annual revenue, boasts a $3.1 trillion market value, and accounts for most of Gates' $100 billion personal fortune.",
      "\u201cSource Code\u201d ends with Gates's drive back to Seattle in 1979, meaning it doesn't touch upon his 1994 marriage to Melinda French, nor their 2021 divorce.",
      "\u201cI am being reflective, which is not my normal mode, but it\u2019s kind of time,\u201d Gates said during an interview about the book with The Associated Press. \u201cAs we went back and got teacher\u2019s comments or people I worked with at Harvard, it was fascinating. I had confused myself into thinking I got straight A\u2019s in ninth grade.\u201d",
      "That might not sound like much of a revelation, but it was a surprise to the cerebral Gates, who paints himself in the book as a \u201cbratty smartass\u201d prone to dismissively sneering, \u201cThat's the stupidest thing I ever heard,\u201d about remarks that seemed nonsensical to him.",
      "Gate's self-portrait is that of a nerd nicknamed \u201cTrey\u201d by his card-playing grandmother because he was the third male on this father's side of the family to be named Bill. He was a pipsqueak who had difficulty making friends and preferred living in his own head before he discovered computers, which became like slot machines that rewarded him for writing elegant lines of code.",
      "When he did talk, the young Gates rocked back and forth like a metronome setting a rhythm for his brain \u2014 a habit that surfaced during parts of his 45-minute interview with the AP.",
      "\u201cIt was a little weird because it was hard to direct my attention,\u201d Gates recalled during the interview. \u201cI had one year in school where they said, \u2018Oh we should put you ahead a couple grades.\u2019 And then another time, they said, \u2018No, we should hold you back.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018Well make up your mind.\u2019 They were a little confounded.\u201d",
      "Although he didn't realize it as a boy, Gates has no doubt he was and still is neurodivergent who channeled that anomaly into learning to program computers at the right time in the right place with the patient support of his late parents (the book is dedicated to them, along with his sister, Kristi and Libby).",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that there was this idea that there are kids that have this kind of unique ability to concentrate but less social skills. I certainly would be included in that,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI encourage people who have strengths and deficits to kind of map their ambition onto something that plays to their strengths. Being able to think just about programming and how you do it better ended up being invaluable for me.\u201d",
      "Gates also had the advantage of growing up in a family that could afford to pay for him to attend a private high school in Seattle. Still, that privilege didn't insulate him from the trauma he experienced when his best friend, Kent Evans, died in a mountain climbing accident in May 1972 \u2014 a year before they were going to graduate.",
      "Evans' death occurred while he and Gates were preparing to spend much of the summer working on a program for their school, but what hurt far more was the loss of someone who understood him and helped give him a sense of purpose for the first time in his life.",
      "\u201cI had no notion of a friend just being gone. It was the only negative thing in my childhood,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt shapes you, that someone can just disappear \u2014 somebody you loved and would have done things with. He would have been part of whatever I ended up going on to do. I give Kent credit, along with Paul (Allen), for setting the direction that I ended up going down.\u201d",
      "Evans' death provided the impetus for Gates to reconnect with Allen, who was already attending college, to help him with his programming projects. Allen, three years older than Gates and a passionate fan of legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, did more than just help with the coding. He also offered Gates some LSD in an attempt to lure his partner down a more psychedelic path.",
      "Gates rebuffed Allen at first but decided to drop acid with a group of high school friends shortly before his 1973 graduation, according to the book.",
      "It wasn't a pleasant experience, a reaction that Gates thought might have been related to the dental surgery he underwent the day after his LSD trip. He tried LSD again with Allen in October 1974 while they were watching an episode of the old \"Kung Fu\" series on TV, and decided he would be better off without psychedelic drugs even though Apple co-founder Steve Jobs contended Microsoft would have created better products had Gates taken more acid.",
      "\"I thought maybe I\u2019d seem cool if I took it, but that didn\u2019t happen,\" Gates said during the interview. \u201cI would say Steve was definitely more hip than I was. He took a lot more acid than I did. He had a sense of style. I had some charisma in terms of motivating engineers and saying this great thing (with personal computers) would happen, but Steve had natural speaking and charisma capabilities, even beyond mine. So I always envied him for the things he did.\"",
      "Gates' mind is now being blown by the recent advances in artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology being planted into Microsoft's software as part of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.",
      "\u201cWhen I finally see ChatGPT-4, where the OpenAI guys show me a very early version, I am just blown away completely,\u201d Gates said. He views AI as an \u201camazing and scary\u201d technology that should be rigorously monitored.",
      "\u201cYou should be nervous. We have to acknowledge that AI is almost uniquely dangerous because it\u2019s unbounded in terms of how good it will get and it\u2019s happening within a generation,\u201d Gates said. \u201cHopefully, the politicians and the technologists will share with each other, and we can shape this thing. We better get on top of that now.\u201d",
      "If nothing else, Gates is hoping \u201cSource Code\u201d will help people see a more human side of him, even if he might never been seen as the cultural tastemaker that Jobs was.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was completely uncool,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut once I got going on Microsoft, I was willing to be pretty monomaniacal. Even people I competed with found it very intimidating how focused I was. I really didn\u2019t goof off in my 20s because my whole thing was having Microsoft move at full speed.\u201d",
      "Perhaps Gates will delve deeper into the monomania that made him so rich, famous and sometimes reviled in the next book about his life \u2014 an installment that he says won't be done until sometime in 2027, at the earliest."

      "The unsolved death of a teenager in 1977 haunted students and staff at Honolulu's McKinley High School for nearly half a century",
      "HONOLULU -- Former Hawaii lawmaker Suzanne Chun Oakland remembers arriving at school one morning in 1977 to an eerie buzz.",
      "The 15-year-old had met up with girlfriends as usual before class at Honolulu's McKinley High School when she learned a student named Dawn Momohara had been found dead on the second floor of a school building.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how we got word of it, but everything spread really quickly,\u201d Chun Oakland said.",
      "Chun Oakland didn't know Momohara, who was 16, but the unsolved death has haunted her and other McKinley students and staff for nearly half a century. That was until last week, when police used advances in DNA technology to arrest a 66-year-old resident of a Utah nursing home.",
      "The suspect, former McKinley student Gideon Castro, was scheduled to make an initial court appearance Friday before a judge in Salt Lake County District Court. He remained in custody Thursday with the bond for his release set at $250,000, according to Salt Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office records.",
      "Castro\u2019s attorney, Marlene Mohn, did not respond to email and phone messages seeking comment.",
      "Momohara had been sexually assaulted and strangled, police said.",
      "\u201cI was just really sad,\" Chun Oakland recalled earlier this week. \"I think for our student body, of course there\u2019s that concern that what if he\u2019s still out there and he does it to somebody else.\u201d",
      "On March 21, 1977, shortly after 7:30 a.m., Honolulu police found Momohara lying on her back, partially clothed, an orange cloth wrapped tightly around her neck.",
      "Details from more than four decades ago are fuzzy for 1967 McKinley graduate Grant Okamura, who was the school\u2019s 28-year-old band teacher in 1977, but the morning Momohara was found has remained a core memory.",
      "Momohara's sister \u2014 one of his flute players \u2014 arrived at school that day not knowing her sister had been found dead, he recalled. The sister was called to the office and later walked into the band room, devastated.",
      "\u201cThe other students were trying to console her,\" Okamura said. \"At that point, I couldn't have band. How do you have a class? She just sat there crying.\u201d",
      "She didn't return to school for weeks afterward.",
      "He doesn't remember the sister's name. The Associated Press was unable to make contact with any possible relatives. Okamura said he met Momohara a few times when he let her into the air-conditioned band room to wait for her sister.",
      "The morning before Momohara was killed, she got a call from an unknown male and told her mother she was going to a nearby shopping center with friends. That was the last time her mother saw her, homicide Lt. Deena Thoemmes said.",
      "Police released sketches of a person of interest and a possible vehicle described by witnesses as a 1974 or 1975 Pontiac Lemans. A witness reported seeing the car when he and his girlfriend drove through campus the night before Momohara died. The witness saw a man and the car on the grass near the school's English building, Thoemmes said.",
      "The witness circled back around but the car and the man were gone.",
      "Police were unable to identify a suspect and the case grew cold, though grief lingered over the campus.",
      "In 2019, cold case detectives asked a forensic biology unit to examine several items of evidence from the scene, including Momohara's underwear. They were able to develop a DNA profile in 2020. Then, in 2023, police received information about potential suspects, two brothers who were interviewed in 1977.",
      "Several days after Momohara was killed, detectives interviewed Castro, who graduated from McKinley High in 1976. He said he met Momohara at a school dance that year and last saw her at a carnival on campus in February 1977. Police interviewed his brother, who also met Momohara at the dance.",
      "In November 2023, Honolulu police went to Chicago, where the brother was living. They \u201csurreptitiously\u201d obtained DNA from one of the brother's adult children, Thoemmes said.",
      "Lab findings excluded the brother as a suspect, but a DNA sample from Castro's adult son, and later from Castro himself, proved he was responsible, Thoemmes said.",
      "He was arrested last week at the nursing home where he lived in Millcreek, just south of Salt Lake City, on suspicion of second-degree murder.",
      "Neither Okamura nor Chun Oakland remembered Castro.",
      "Chun Oakland graduated in 1979 and grew up to become a Democratic member of the Hawaii Senate. She said Momohara's killing bothered her over the years, especially when she would meet victims through her work as a lawmaker or as a board member of the nonprofit Sex Abuse Treatment Center, a statewide program provding services for sexual assault survivors.",
      "Chun Oakland said she is grateful an arrest was possible even after all these years.",
      "\u201cI think the community in general, and our elected officials, they know the importance of trying to preserve the evidence that can someday be able to see justice for that individual or individuals,\" she said.",

    "summary": "The order will establish sweeping mandates on sex and sports policy.",
    "story": [
      "The order is titled \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports.\"",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sports, fulfilling a promise that was at the center of his 2024 campaign.",
      "The order will establish sweeping mandates on sex and sports policy and will direct federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, to interpret federal Title IX rules as prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports categories, according to a White House document on the executive order obtained by ABC News.",
      "Titled \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,\" the order will mandate immediate enforcement, including against schools and athletic associations that \"deny women single-sex sports and single-sex locker rooms,\" according to the document, and will direct state attorneys general to identify best practices for enforcing the mandate.",
      "Surrounded by female athletes at the signing ceremony, Trump railed against what he called \"transgender lunacy.\"",
      "\"Under the Trump administration, we will defend the proud tradition of female athletes, and we will not allow men to beat up, injure and cheat our women and our girls,\" Trump said.",
      "He also falsely claimed that Algerian boxer Imane Khelif -- who faced attacks over her sex and gender during the 2024 Paris Olympics -- was \"a male,\" despite identifying a woman and having been assigned female at birth, according to the IOC.",
      "The White House expects sports bodies like the NCAA to change their rules in accordance with the order after it is signed, according to a senior administration official.",
      "\"We're a national governing body and we follow federal law,\" NCAA President Charlie Baker told Republican senators at a hearing in December. \"Clarity on this issue at the federal level would be very helpful.\"",

      "Trump was joined at the ceremony by athletes, coaches and advocates who have campaigned against transgender participation in women's sports. More than 60 attendees, including former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines, joined the ceremony.",
      "\"We want to take actions to affirmatively protect women's sports,\" deputy assistant to the president and senior policy strategist May Mailman told ABC News, adding that the executive order is designed to further overturn Biden-era policies that required schools and athletic organizations to treat gender identity and sex as equivalent. She noted that a court ruling determined such requirements were not necessary, and that the president's executive order would explicitly ban them.",
      "Trump's executive order will lead to increased discrimination and harassment, Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson said in a statement on Tuesday.",
      "\"This order could expose young people to harassment and discrimination, emboldening people to question the gender of kids who don't fit a narrow view of how they're supposed to dress or look,\" Robinson said. \"Participating in sports is about learning the values of teamwork, dedication, and perseverance. And for so many students, sports are about finding somewhere to belong. We should want that for all kids \u2013 not partisan policies that make life harder for them.\"",
      "Mailman said the executive order's goal was \"not to make sure that everybody conforms to their sex stereotype as they're playing sports\" but to \"protect women's sports,\" adding that options like co-ed categories would still be available.",
      "If universities don't comply, the White House warned they could not only lose federal funding but also face legal action.",
      "\"If schools don't comply, it's not just that they're at risk of DOJ-based actions,\" Mailman said. \"Title IX has a private right of action component behind it, so if schools are violating the law, they're at risk of lawsuits from their female students, that is going to actually be more than just taking away federal funding. These are multi-million dollar lawsuits.\"",
      "The Daily Wire was first to report that Trump would sign the executive order on Wednesday.",
      "The executive order also directs the secretary of state to push for changes within the International Olympic Committee to maintain single-sex competition and the Department of Homeland Security to review visa policies to prevent transgender women from identifying as female, which would allow them to compete in women's sports, according to the document detailing the order.",
      "The order will also direct private sporting bodies to attend an in-person White House meeting to hear accounts from female athletes in person, according to the document.",
      "\"The Executive Order calls for the convening of private sporting bodies in the White House to hear, in person, the stories of female athletes who suffer life-long injuries, who have been silenced and forced to shower with men, and whose hard work has been cast aside due to the biological advantage of males,\" the document states.",
      "The order is the most aggressive move yet by Trump to fulfill one of his central campaign promises regarding transgender athletes in women's sports.",
      "Trump signed an executive order last week seeking to restrict gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",
      "The order would move to restrict medical institutions that receive federal funding from providing such care -- including puberty blockers, hormone therapies, and surgeries -- calling on the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to \"take all appropriate actions to end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\"",

      "Designated a special government employee by the White House, Musk claims he has been checking with President Donald Trump about his tactics.",
      "\"I went over it with him in detail, and he agreed that we should shut it down,\" Musk said Monday about his effort to curtail USAID.",

      "Organized by the AFL-CIO, Democratic lawmakers, and other federal employee groups, demonstrators held signs saying, \"nobody elected Musk,\" \"Elon owns Trump,\" and \"checks and balances.\"",
      "David Casserly, a Department of Labor staffer told ABC News' Jay O'Brien that what Musk is doing is \"not a good thing for the American people\" and he had a question for the 77 million Americans who voted for Donald Trump.",
      "\"Is this what you voted for? Is this what you really want? Some unelected billionaire coming in and deciding to cut things he had never heard of until yesterday,\" he said",
      "Meanwhile, fireworks over Musk's actions exploded in Congress.",
      "Rep. Gerry Connolly, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, tore into Musk at a hearing as he moved to subpoena the controversial billionaire.",
      "\"It's a puzzling role for many people, certainly on this side of the aisle, and I think for some on yours, who is this unelected billionaire that he can attempt to dismantle federal agencies, fire people, transfer them, offer them early retirement and have sweeping changes to agencies without any congressional review, oversight or concurrence,\" he said.",
      "Republicans on the committee pushed back and engaged in a shouting match with Democrats over Musk. When GOP chairman Rep. James Comer put the subpoena motion to a vote, it failed along party lines.",
      "Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who has shown support for DOGE in the past, abstained from voting.",

      "DOGE is looking for anything tied to DEI and that they removed anything DEI-related from bulletin boards, including posters and signs, the sources said. They also checked bathroom signs to ensure they complied with Trump's executive orders.",
      "A former NOAA employee told ABC News that he is concerned that representatives from DOGE will employ what he called the Musk's strategy of breaking things now and fixing them later. He said he's worried that NOAA's irreplaceable climate and weather data could be damaged or lost and that DOGE may be following the Project 2025 playbook.",
      "Trump has tried to distance himself from the plan, even though his nominee to head the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, was one of its authors.",
      "Project 2025 calls for breaking up NOAA and privatizing forecast operations. In the document, the authors wrote that NOAA is \"one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity.\"",

      "Musk initially wanted an office in the White House West Wing but told people he thought what he was given was too small, multiple people familiar with his comments told ABC News. So, instead, he took an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the sources said.",
      "Musk moved beds into both the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and the United States Office of Personnel Management, according to sources. The move is intended to allow both Musk and his staff to sleep there if working late, the sources said.",
      "It follows a familiar practice at tech companies in Silicon Valley.",
      "Musk's team is staffed largely by engineers and young people with little experience in government policy. At least one as young as 19 years old, according to sources.",

      "Bipartisan move follows ABC News' reporting on AI tool's links to Chinese state.",
      "Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) is demanding swift action after ABC News' exclusive reporting about hidden links in DeepSeek's artificial intelligence tool that could potentially send data to a Chinese state-owned telecommunications company.",
      "\"I think we should ban DeepSeek from all government devices immediately. No one should be allowed to download it onto their device,\" Gottheimer, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC News.",
      "A new bill Gottheimer proposed on Thursday is called the \"No DeepSeek on Government Devices Act\" and it would require the Office of Management and Budget to develop guidelines within 60 days for the removal of DeepSeek from federal technologies, with exceptions for law enforcement and national security-related activity.",
      "The bill would ban DeepSeek from federal devices as well as any future product developed by High-Flyer, the artificial intelligent tool's hedge fund backers.",
      "This comes after the U.S. House of Representatives chief administrative officer issued a memo urging staffers against using DeepSeek last week.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 10:53:01 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration's offer to extend deferred resignations to the intelligence community poses a grave threat to U.S. national security interests, ex-officials say.",
    "story": [
      "The buyout offer has been met with \"frustration and anger\" inside the CIA.",
      "The Trump administration's offer to extend deferred resignations to members of the intelligence community as part of the federal buyouts being offered to trim the size of the government poses a grave threat to U.S. national security interests, lawmakers and former officials said Wednesday.",
      "Employees at the nation's foremost intelligence collection and analysis outfits -- including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the National Security Agency -- received email notices over the last week offering them the opportunity to leave their roles yet continue to be paid through September, multiple sources confirmed to ABC News.",
      "Unlike similar offers extended to employees at other federal agencies, U.S. officials said not all intelligence workers are eligible for the buyouts and certain resignations will be reviewed before a decision is made about whether they can be accepted.",
      "Nevertheless, the deferred resignation offers were met by many in the intelligence community with a mix of \"frustration and anger,\" said one former CIA officer who remains in contact with current administration officials. The former official said that \"their frustration comes from watching an illogical policy jeopardize the mission they've dedicated their careers to protecting.\"",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed that sentiment, telling ABC News in a statement that the buyouts \"serve only to hollow out the very agencies we call on to protect our national security and insult the men and women who have dedicated their lives to keeping Americans safe.\"",
      "A CIA spokesperson characterized the offers as being \"part of a holistic strategy to infuse the Agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position the CIA to deliver on its mission.\"",
      "But former officials questioned whether the administration had fully considered the consequences of arbitrarily allowing highly trained intelligence officials to leave their posts.",
      "\"What capabilities are we going to lose? What is the plan to replace that capability when they walk out the door?\" asked Charles Kupperman, a former deputy national security adviser during Trump's first term. \"I do not think the administration is taking that loss seriously.\"",
      "Many roles in the intelligence community, particularly those in operations and analysis, require years of tradecraft, weapons, and language training.",
      "Darrell Blocker, an ABC News contributor and former CIA officer who oversaw the agency's storied training facility, said \"from the moment operations officers take the oath to the time they reach full performance\" can take up to eight years.",
      "\"Decisions being made today will have an impact on our national security over the next decade, based on the training cycle,\" Blocker said.",
      "Losing experienced intelligence analysts presents a different set of challenges. Brian O'Neill, a former CIA executive, said the buyouts would unequivocally undermine the intelligence community's substantial \"institutional knowledge.\"",
      "The senior officers and analysts most inclined to accept buyouts are high performers with the talent to pursue lucrative work in the private sector, O'Neill suggested. Conversely, the policy may lead lower performers with fewer job prospects to remain in their roles, he said.",
      "\"This policy reflects a misguided, shotgun approach that will gut the Agency's core expertise and stability,\" O'Neill said.",
      "Former officials also expressed alarm at reports Wednesday that the CIA had shared a list of all employees hired within the past two years with the White House Office of Management and Budget in compliance with Trump's executive order seeking to reduce the federal workforce.",
      "A U.S. official confirmed to ABC News that the agency shared the first names and last initials of new employees over a nonclassified system, prompting scrutiny of what former officials called a potential counterintelligence risk. The email was first reported by the New York Times.",
      "Andrew Bakaj, an attorney who once served in the intelligence community's office of inspector general, said the administration's actions \"underscore the extent to which the Trump administration is willing to sell out national security.\"",
      "\"Our adversaries abroad are celebrating these purges,\" Bakaj said.",
      "The CIA defended its sharing of the new employees' names, with a CIA spokesperson telling ABC News, \"We are complying with the Executive Orders, and are providing requested information through the appropriate channels.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 08:06:37 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's improbable proposal for a U.S. takeover of Gaza prompted plenty of pushback and questions.",
    "story": [
      "\"It gets us away from thinking about the real problem,\" an expert told ABC News.",
      "The world was still reeling Wednesday from President Donald Trump's stunning proposal that the U.S. \"take over\" war-torn Gaza, clear the rubble and economically develop the area -- after the nearly 2 million Palestinians who live there were removed to other countries.",
      "His bombshell announcement  was met with immediate pushback from Arab states and generated countless questions. Many said it would violate international law by seizing a territory by force, and others said displacing its people could flatly constitute a war crime.",
      "\"My initial reaction is, it's illegal,\" Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told ABC News. \"That it is harkening back to the days of colonialism and forced population transfers, which we thought were over when the United States and others established the world order that we've seen since the end of World War II\" -- when the Geneva Conventions were adopted.",
      "\"This is a nonstarter to begin with,\" said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer now at the Brookings Institution's Center for Middle East Policy.",
      "Trump revealed his idea during a joint news conference Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he had studied it for months and his decision to go forward wasn't something \"made lightly.\"",
      "He said he saw a \"long-term ownership position\" for the United States in Gaza and they'd \"make sure something really spectacular is done.\" He said the \"world's people\" would live in Gaza after, including Palestinians, though earlier in the day he said he'd support a permanent resettlement of Palestinians elsewhere. Despite that, the White House on Wednesday said the relocation would be \"temporary\" as the rebuild took place, though officials also say it could take 10 to 15 years to complete.",
      "Trump said he was open to the possibility of sending U.S. troops to Gaza to see it through -- \"if necessary,\" he said -- despite his \"America First\" campaign promise to keep the U.S. out of foreign wars and other entanglements.",
      "The White House on Wednesday made the case that Trump has not \"committed\" to putting the military on the ground there, but indicated he wouldn't rule it out entirely in order to maintain leverage in negotiations.",
      "\"President Trump is an outside-of-the-box thinker and a visionary leader who solves problems that many others, especially in this city, claim are unsolvable,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.",
      "Leavitt, however, didn't provide many details of how exactly a U.S. takeover would play out. Secretary of State Marco Rubio tried to soften the impact in the face of widespread backlash, arguing Trump's gambit was \"not meant as hostile.\"",
      "Foreign policy experts who spoke with ABC News said it's unclear what Trump is hoping to accomplish.",
      "\"It's sort of puzzling to me because he definitely wants to have some sort of recognition for the Abraham Accords he did in 2020 but this is the exact opposite thing he should do if he wants to actually see progress in the Middle East. I think he lost yardage here,\" said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute.",
      "Arab states are either openly slamming Trump's comments or reiterating their belief the only path forward is a two-state solution.",
      "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Trump's pitch represented a \"serious violation of international law.\" Hamas called on Trump to retract the statements.",
      "Jordan said King Abdullah II stressed \"the need to put a stop to settlement expansion, expressing rejection of any attempts to annex land and displace the Palestinians.\" Abdullah is set to meet with Trump in Washington next week.",
      "The U.S. has long pushed for a two-state solution, and Trump's national security adviser Michael Waltz told CBS News on Wednesday that Trump's comments on a takeover did not suggest an end to that decades-long goal.",
      "Waltz said he believed Trump's takeover proposal could spur diplomacy. \"It's going to bring the entire region to come with their own solutions, if they don't like Mr. Trump's solutions,\" he said.",
      "CSIS expert Hall said a \"generous\" view of what Trump is trying to do is potentially push Jordan and Egypt to do more for Palestinian refugees, or aid Netanyahu as the Israeli leader faces a fragile political coalition with far-right members of his government who want to resume war.",
      "But others called it a distraction.",
      "\"What it does is it gets us away from thinking about the real problem, which is how we create law and order and stability in Gaza to allow reconstruction of infrastructure to begin,\" said Riedel. \"That's the real urgent priority.\"",
      "All of this is playing out amid a fragile ceasefire and hostage release deal that is in its first phase. Hamas said on Tuesday that negotiations have begun for the second phase of the deal.",
      "Nathan Brown, a professor at George Washington University and fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Trump's takeover plan could harden Hamas and \"diminishes the incentives for many parties to push it forward.\"",
      "The Middle East Institute's Katulis maintained that Hamas and Israel still have reason to move forward but Trump's proposal for U.S. control of Gaza is, at the very least, \"not helpful\" and \"distracts from the real issues.\"",

      "President Donald Trump has nominated Neil Jacobs, an atmospheric scientist, to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "If confirmed, this will be Jacobs' second stint leading the agency. Beginning in 2019, he served as its acting administrator until Trump left office at the end of his term in January 2021.",
      "Jacobs is remembered for the so-called \"Sharpiegate\" incident, a September 2019 controversy during which Trump, in an Oval Office press briefing, showed a map of Hurricane Dorian's forecast track that appeared to have been altered with a black pen to show the storm's track extended to include southern Alabama. Though the official storm track from the National Weather Service (NWS) did not have it hitting the state, Trump had inaccurately declared a few days earlier that it would.",
      "Shortly after Trump made the claim, NOAA issued a statement siding with Trump and admonishing the NWS for publicly saying that Alabama was not in danger from the storm.",
      "Dorian ultimately did not make landfall in the U.S. and stayed east of Florida.",
      "The NOAA Science Council subsequently investigated Jacobs, saying that he violated the organization's scientific integrity policy by issuing a statement supporting Trump's incorrect claim about Dorian's storm track as an official NOAA release.",
      "Jacobs is currently the chief science advisor for the community Unified Forecast System (UFS), part of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research's (UCAR) Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Science at North Carolina State University.",
      "The UFS is an effort by the broad scientific community to develop a common, open-source modeling infrastructure that encourages collaboration and eases the transition from research to operations to improve NOAA's forecast models.",
      "Jacobs has long supported an open innovation approach and well-coordinated research efforts that are mutually beneficial to the public, private, and academic sectors. In 2021, he published an article in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, discussing his vision for the community UFS.",
      "Before serving as NOAA's acting director, Jacobs was the chief atmospheric scientist at Panasonic Avionics Corporation, where he directed the research and development of its aviation weather observing platforms and modeling programs.",
      "In a November 2024 podcast interview, Jacobs shared his views on the future of government agencies, like NOAA, and also weighed in on Project 2025, a playbook of controversial conservative policy proposals co-authored by many Trump allies and members of his first administration, organized by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation and which includes recommendations to repeal and eliminate preventive climate change initiatives.",
      "\"Any time there's an administration or an election year, whether it's an incumbent or a new administration, you're always going to have these think tanks and groups pushing transition documents to the transition team saying, this is what you should do, you should read this,\" Jacobs said. \"The executive branch can't just come in and completely change something that's authorized in law.\"",
      "Jacobs also said that \"NOAA has all of these congressional mandates that are codified. Congress would have to rewrite a mountain of legislation to undo all that.\u201d",
      "Last month, Jacobs was recognized as a 2025 Fellow of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) during the organization's annual meeting. An AMS Fellow is a distinction reserved for those who have made \"outstanding contributions to the atmospheric or related oceanic or hydrologic sciences or their applications during a substantial period of years.\"",

      "Transgender young adults and families with transgender youth filed a legal challenge Tuesday against an executive order from the Trump administration that restricts gender-affirming care for transgender people under 19.",
      "\u201cWhen the Tennessee Legislature passed a law that banned gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, I knew we had to leave the state so that my daughter could continue receiving the care she needs,\u201d said Kristen Chapman, the mother of 17-year-old plaintiff Willow, in a statement.",
      "The Virginia resident continued: \"We moved to Virginia in the summer of 2023, but struggled to find a provider that would accept our Medicaid insurance. As paying for her care out-of-pocket became prohibitively expensive, I tried for months to get an appointment at VCU, and I finally got an appointment for January 29, 2025. The day before our appointment, President Trump signed the executive order at issue in this case. The next day, just a few hours before our appointment, VCU told us they would not be able to provide Willow with care. I thought Virginia would be a safe place for me and my daughter. Instead, I am heartbroken, tired, and scared.\u201d",
      "Trump's order moves to withhold federal funding to medical institutions that provide such care -- including puberty blockers, hormone therapies, and surgeries -- calling on the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to \"take all appropriate actions to end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\" The executive order does not appear to restrict these procedures for non-transgender people under 19.",
      "Trump's executive order states that \"it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.\"",

      "Major national medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and more than 20 others argue that gender-affirming care is safe, effective, beneficial, and medically necessary.",
      "The complaint notes that \"for many transgender adolescents, the onset of puberty leading to physical changes in their bodies that are incongruent with their gender identities can cause extreme distress.\"",
      "It continued, \"Puberty-delaying medication allows transgender adolescents to pause these changes, thereby minimizing and potentially preventing the heightened gender dysphoria caused by the development of secondary sex characteristics incongruent with their gender identity.\"",
      "The executive order is the latest action from Trump that impacts the transgender community -- which is estimated to make up less than 1% of the population over the age of 13. Trump also recently signed executive orders restricting transgender participation in the military, ending federal legal recognition of transgender people, and restricting gender marker changes on federal documents.",
      "The Supreme Court is currently considering the landmark U.S. v. Skrmetti case, which challenges Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming puberty blockers and hormone therapy on the grounds that the law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution by discriminating based on sex.",

      "SEATTLE -- A federal judge who already questioned the constitutionality of President Donald Trump's birthright citizenship executive order is set to hear arguments Thursday over a longer-term pause of the directive, which aims to end citizenship for children born to parents not legally in the country.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Coughenour in Seattle has scheduled a hearing involving lawyers from the Trump administration, four states suing to stop the order, and an immigrant rights organization, which is challenging it on behalf of a proposed class of expectant parents.",
      "The latest proceeding comes just a day after a Maryland federal judge issued a nationwide pause in a separate but similar case involving immigrants' rights groups and pregnant women whose soon-to-born children could be affected.",

      "On Thursday, the birthright citizenship issue is back before Coughenour, a Ronald Reagan appointee. During a hearing last month, he said the case stood out in his more than four decades as a federal judge. \"I can\u2019t remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is,\u201d he told a Justice Department attorney.",
      "His temporary order blocking the executive action was set to expire Thursday when he'll hear arguments over whether he should issue an injunction similar to the one issued by the judge in Maryland.",
      "In total, 22 states, as well as other organizations, have sued to try to stop the executive action.",
      "The matter before the Seattle judge Thursday involves four states: Arizona, Illinois, Oregon and Washington. It also has been consolidated with a lawsuit brought by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. Eighteen states, led by Iowa, have filed a \u201cfriend-of-the-court\u201d brief supporting the Trump administration's position in the case.",
      "Yet another hearing is set for Friday in a Massachusetts court. That case involves a different group of 18 states challenging the order, including New Jersey, which is the lead plaintiff.",
      "At the heart of the lawsuits is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the infamous Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which held Scott, an enslaved man, wasn\u2019t a citizen despite having lived in a state where slavery was outlawed.",
      "The plaintiffs argue the amendment, which holds that \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside,\" are indisputably citizens.",
      "The Trump administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution does not harbor a windfall clause granting American citizenship to ... the children of those who have circumvented (or outright defied) federal immigration laws,\u201d the government argued in reply to the Maryland plaintiffs\u2019 suit.",
      "Attorneys for the states have argued that it certainly does \u2014 and that has been recognized since the amendment's adoption, notably in an 1898 U.S. Supreme Court decision. That decision, United States v. Wong Kim Ark, held that the only children who did not automatically receive U.S. citizenship upon being born on U.S. soil were children of diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in the U.S. during hostile occupation; those born on foreign ships; and those born to members of sovereign Native American tribes.",
      "The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship \u2014 the principle of jus soli or \u201cright of the soil\u201d \u2014 is applied. Most are in the Americas, and Canada and Mexico are among them.",

      "\"This is an insane proposal, and there's been a huge backlash already, because the president of the United States was saying that he would use U.S. military force, if necessary, to forcibly remove 2 million Palestinians from Gaza -- that's ethnic cleansing by another name -- so that it could be redeveloped,\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told CNN on Wednesday morning, adding that it could be \u201cdangerous\u201d for both the U.S. and the Middle East.",
      "Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., called the plan \u201cabsolutely dumb, stupid and illegal\u201d while Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. called it \"dangerous\" and \"inconsistent with American values.\"",
      "Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., said that Trump is \u201ccompletely ignoring the sovereignty and the self determination of the Palestinian people who have lived in this place for generations and he's got his eye on some real estate deal because he thinks the coastline of Gaza is going to be great for some new hotel.\u201d She told CNN that the plan is \u201chorrifying\u201d and \u201cridiculous,\u201d shortly after Trump announced it Tuesday night during a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "Before announcing his desire to \"take over\" Gaza on Tuesday, Trump had pushed for Palestinians to relocate, a suggestion that was roundly rejected by neighbors in the region and from U.S. allies.",
      "Texas Democratic Rep. Al Green announced on Wednesday that he intends to file articles of impeachment against Trump over his proposal.",
      "Some Democrats also asserted that Trump's comments were meant to distract from Elon Musk being given access to the Treasury Department's federal payment system and disrupting other government agencies.",
      "\"I have news for you -- we aren\u2019t taking over Gaza. But the media and the chattering class will focus on it for a few days and Trump will have succeeded in distracting everyone from the real story -- the billionaires seizing government to steal from regular people,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said on X. He also later referred to the plan as a \u201cbad, sick joke.\u201d",
      "However, Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., who breaks with his party at times, downplayed the severity of Trump\u2019s calls, saying he didn\u2019t interpret them at face value or as a \u201csuper serious kind of a situation,\u201d but rather as Trump \u201cjust trying to shake things up.\u201d",

      "Few Senate Republicans were willing to back U.S. boots on the ground if that was to be part of the plan.",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-S.D., highlighted Trump\u2019s accolades as a developer but was rather explicit that occupying Gaza would be \"an inappropriate use of US troops.\"",
      "\u201cWell, there's taking over Gaza, there's helping rebuild Gaza. Probably need some clarification on what exactly that means,\" he said, adding that \"obviously, Gaza is not ours.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune suggested that the president \u201cwants to bring a more peaceful, secure Middle East, and he\u2019s put some ideas out there.\u201d",

      "Retired Lt. Col. Harry Stewart Jr, a decorated World War II pilot who broke racial barriers as a Tuskegee Airmen and earned honors for his combat heroism, has died. He was 100.",
      "Stewart was one of the last surviving combat pilots of the famed 332nd Fighter Group also known as the Tuskegee Airmen. The group were the nation\u2019s first Black military pilots.",
      "The Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum confirmed his death. The organization said he passed peacefully at his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, on Sunday.",
      "Stewart earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for downing three German aircraft during a dogfight on April 1, 1945. He was also part of a team of four Tuskegee Airmen who won the U.S. Air Force Top Gun flying competition in 1949, although their accomplishment would not be recognized until decades later.",
      "\u201cHarry Stewart was a kind man of profound character and accomplishment with a distinguished career of service he continued long after fighting for our country in World War II,\u201d Brian Smith, president and CEO of the Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum, said.",
      "Born on July 4, 1924, in Virginia, his family moved to New York when he was young. Stewart had dreamed of flying since he was a child when he would watch planes at LaGuardia airport, according to a book about his life titled \u201cSoaring to Glory: A Tuskegee Airmen\u2019s Firsthand Account of World War II.\u201d In the wake of Pearl Harbor, an 18-year-old Stewart joined what was then considered an experiment to train Black military pilots. The unit sometimes was also known as the Tuskegee Airmen for where they trained in Alabama or the Red Tails because of the red tips of their P-51 Mustangs.",
      "\u201cI did not recognize at the time the gravity of what we are facing. I just felt as though it was a duty of mine at the time. I just stood up to my duty,\u201d Stewart said of World War II in a 2024 interview with CNN about the war.",
      "Having grown up in a multicultural neighborhood, the segregation and prejudice of the Jim Crow-era South came as a shock to Stewart, but he was determined to finish and earn his wings according to the book about his life. After finishing training, the pilots were assigned to escort U.S. bombers in Europe. The Tuskegee Airmen are credited with losing significantly fewer escorted bombers than other fighter groups.",
      "\u201cI got to really enjoy the idea of the panorama, I would say, of the scene I would see before me with the hundreds of bombers and the hundreds of fighter planes up there and all of them pulling the condensation trails, and it was just the ballet in the sky and a feeling of belonging to something that was really big,\u201d Stewart said in a 2020 interview with WAMC.",
      "Stewart would sometimes say in a self-effacing way that he was too busy enjoying flying to realize he was making history, according to his book.",
      "Stewart had hoped to become a commercial airline pilot after he left the military, but was rejected because of his race. He went on to earn a mechanical engineering degree New York University. He relocated to Detroit and retired as vice president of a natural gas pipeline company.",
      "Stewart told Michigan Public Radio in 2019 that he was moved to tears on a recent commercial flight when he saw who was piloting the aircraft.",
      "\u201cWhen I entered the plane, I looked into the cockpit there and there were two African American pilots. One was the co-pilot, and one was the pilot. But not only that, the thing that started bringing the tears to my eyes is that they were both female,\u201d Stewart said.",
      "The Air Force last month briefly removed training course s with videos of its storied Tuskegee Airmen and the Women Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs in an effort to comply with the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The materials were quickly restored following a bipartisan backlash."

      "Next-door neighbors lost their near-identical homes in a California wildfire, but how they are navigating rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery, a stark reflection of the nation\u2019s growing home insurance crisis",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Before a wildfire ravaged their street in northwest Altadena, Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson lived next door to each other in nearly identical houses.",
      "\u201cI chose an old home in an old neighborhood because it has soul,\u201d said Hamlin, a 51-year-old single mom with a teenage boy, who bought her 1,500-square-foot home 10 years ago.",
      "Today, gone are their charming English-style cottages built in 1925 with the welcoming porches and Palladian windows. Amid the rubble and ash, little is left of their historic neighborhood.",
      "In the weeks since the Eaton wildfire took their homes, Hamlin and Wilson have been stumbling through the layers of business, bureaucracy and emotional trauma of surviving a natural disaster, with their sights firmly set on rebuilding.",
      "How they\u2019ll navigate rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery that reveals the nation\u2019s growing home insurance crisis. Her insurance has already paid out nearly a million dollars and she is searching for contractors. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "\u201cIt changes the whole trajectory to your life,\u201d said Wilson, 44, who bought his house five years ago with his wife, who is six months pregnant with their first child.",
      "Hamlin\u2019s home was privately covered by Mercury Insurance, but Wilson was forced onto the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state\u2019s bare-bones insurance program \u2014 when SafeCo declined to renew his policy last May. The FAIR Plan insures people who can\u2019t get private coverage but need insurance as a condition of their mortgage.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters become more frequent due to climate change, many property owners find themselves struggling to find or afford private insurance. The issue is particularly acute in California, where some major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies altogether or are refusing to renew existing ones.",
      "State officials recently started rolling out new regulations to entice insurers to stay in California, with the hope of getting as many homeowners as possible off the FAIR Plan.",
      "FAIR, with its high premiums and basic coverage, was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders find a more permanent option. Yet the number of FAIR Plan residential policies more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies last year.",
      "For Wilson and Hamlin, their parallel rebuilding journeys serve as a cautionary tale. Wilson paid nearly 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, for less than half the coverage.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why a lot of people call it 'The Unfair Plan.\u2019\" said Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders.",
      "SafeCo's parent company Liberty Mutual said in a statement that it couldn't comment on any individual policies but acknowledged \u201cdifficult but purposeful business decisions\u201d in California.",
      "Mercury didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurance companies, said California is fortunate to have the FAIR Plan, which is required to accept everyone. Ruiz said outcomes would be even worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said California is working to make sure all claims are paid. He said in a statement that his office is working to get homeowners off the FAIR Plan and back to traditional more comprehensive insurance coverage.",
      "A FAIR Plan spokesperson declined to comment on Wilson\u2019s case, and noted that it\u2019s difficult to compare policies and coverage.",
      "Thousands of people lost their homes in the Eaton and nearby Palisades fires, which were among the most destructive in California history.",
      "The FAIR Plan said it expanded staffing to meet the surging demand and has a funding mechanism in place to pay all covered claims. State data shows more than 31,000 wildfire-related claims had been filed as of last week, including roughly 4,400 claims under the FAIR Plan.",
      "Hamlin had standard comprehensive home insurance, with an annual policy premium of $1,264 at the time of the fire. She can receive up to $1.5 million to replace her home, other structures and personal property, including up to $303,000 for living expenses while displaced. Her policy further entitles her to coverage that could add more than $200,000 to help her rebuild.",
      "Wilson, meanwhile, pays a $2,000 premium for the FAIR Plan that sets his maximum payout at $686,000, including $100,000 for living expenses while displaced.",
      "Wilson also had to buy \u201cwrap-around insurance\u201d for $1,500 a year for issues the FAIR Plan doesn\u2019t cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects. That supplemental plan doesn\u2019t cover fire damage.",
      "Hamlin said Mercury's support has been exceptional, immediately sending her money and helping with next steps such as finding housing and getting contractor quotes. Within days, the company wired her tens of thousands of dollars to get started while the process fell into place.",
      "\u201cBeing able to rest at night and wake up and deal with everything else is really important,\u201d Hamlin said.",
      "Meanwhile, Wilson has struggled to even talk to a FAIR Plan representative. There was zero communication in the first two weeks, contact information was listed incorrectly, phone numbers had no voicemail and emails bounced back.",
      "\u201cHalf the time, I feel like I\u2019m doing something wrong,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "After The Associated Press reached out for comment, Insurance Department spokesperson Michael Soller said a representative would contact Wilson directly.",
      "Wilson said he feels haunted by his choices. He thought he had bought property in a low-risk area, and had avoided looking for homes in another neighborhood further north after hearing that people there had been dropped by their insurers.",
      "Hamlin, too, was aware of the fire risks when she moved in. She previously lived in Pasadena and was surprised that State Farm, her then-insurance company, would not offer her coverage in Altadena. She chose Mercury because it was the cheapest option, and was considering pursuing even more robust coverage.",
      "\u201cI could have been dropped when Chris was dropped. Any of us could be at any time. It\u2019s just luck, really. It\u2019s nothing I did or didn\u2019t do,\u201d Hamlin said, stunned by the comparison. \u201cI had the same risk factors as everyone else.\u201d",
      "Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley, said the seemingly random nature of who gets dropped and when has much to do with insurance companies' complicated risk models.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all trying to manage their exposure,\u201d Collier said. \u201cIf you think about wildfires, you don\u2019t want concentrated exposure.\u201d",
      "Wilson said SafeCo requested an inspection of his property before deciding not to renew his policy. Panicked, he tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with them, offering to clear brushes, trim trees near the roof, and other wildfire mitigation efforts.",
      "Wilson shopped around aggressively with his insurance agent but to no avail, and resigned himself to the FAIR Plan, assuming he would eventually find private insurance again.",
      "There was another catch: Wilson said he couldn\u2019t get comprehensive replacement cost coverage on the FAIR Plan because his roof was too old. Instead, he ended up with what is known as \u201cactual cash value\u201d coverage, which greatly limits the payout based on the physical depreciation of what was lost.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars and that\u2019s very, very painful,\u201d said Bach of United Policyholders.",
      "Citing rising fire risks and other problems, seven of the top 12 insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in California in 2023. State regulations give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing policies in high-risk areas, including consideration of climate change in premiums and passing the costs of reinsurance to consumers.",
      "But those are only short-term solutions, said Dave Jones, California's insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2018. He pointed to Florida, where officials have \u201cdone everything the insurers asked California to do\u201d but yielded little success.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re marching steadily towards an uninsurable future in the United States because we\u2019re not doing enough fast enough to address the underlying cause, which is climate change,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Unless governments take on the financial burden of serious mitigation efforts, the price of California\u2019s fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, Collier of UC Berkeley said. That could be the underinsured \u2014 like Wilson \u2014 swallowing their personal losses, or all California homeowners collectively saddled with increased premiums, or both. State Farm, California\u2019s largest insurance company, this week urged the state to approve an emergency rate hike of 22% for homeowner policies starting in May after processing nearly 8,700 claims and paying out more than $1 billion to policyholders for the LA fires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of risk in the system and there\u2019s a big question of who is going to pay for this,\u201d Collier said.",

      "The United States is the world\u2019s largest source of foreign assistance by far, although several European countries allocate a much bigger share of their budgets. While aid to Africa dwarfs the roughly $2 billion that Latin America receives annually, the Western Hemisphere has long been a spending priority of both Democratic and Republican administrations.",
      "Here is a look at USAID\u2019s impact around the world:",
      "USAID has been critical in providing humanitarian assistance in Colombia, conservation efforts in the Brazilian Amazon and coca eradication in Peru. Recent USAID money has also supported emergency humanitarian aid to more than 2.8 million Venezuelans who fled economic crisis.",
      "In 2024 alone, the agency transferred some $45 million to the U.N. World Food Program, mostly to assist Venezuelans.",
      "In Brazil, USAID\u2019s largest initiative is the Partnership for the Conservation of Amazon Biodiversity, which focuses on conservation and improving livelihoods for Indigenous peoples and other rainforest communities.",
      "Over in Peru, part of USAID's $135 million funding in 2024 was dedicated to financing cocaine-production alternatives such as coffee and cacao. The humanitarian agency has been seeking to curb production of the drug since the early 1980s.",
      "Last year, the U.S. gave the sub-Saharan region more than $6.5 billion in humanitarian assistance. But since Trump's announcement, HIV patients in Africa found locked doors at clinics funded by an acclaimed U.S. program that helped rein in the global AIDS epidemic.",
      "Known as one of the world\u2019s most successful foreign aid program, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, has been credited with saving more than 25 million lives, largely in Africa.",

      "North Carolina Republicans have unveiled their initial attempt this year to boost recovery funding for Hurricane Helene\u2019s historic flooding",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republican lawmakers on Wednesday unveiled their initial attempt this year to boost recovery funding for Hurricane Helene's historic flooding, proposing new spending that totals less than half of what new Democratic Gov. Josh Stein requested this week.",
      "A House committee reviewed but did not vote on the $500 million spending proposal, which would include money for some of the programs Stein sought funding for in his request Monday for $1.07 billion in new recovery spending.",
      "Last fall, the state legislature appropriated well over $900 million for relief and rebuilding efforts. A couple of hundred million additional dollars previously earmarked for relief purposes would help pay for the packages from Stein and House Republicans.",
      "GOP legislative leaders and Stein have made enacting a funding bill early in the General Assembly session \u2014 rather than waiting until the traditional state government budget that takes effect July 1 gets negotiated \u2014 a top priority. Stein and lawmakers will seek more recovery funds this year.",
      "\u201cWe know that no matter what appropriation we\u2019re able to do, it\u2019s never going to be enough,\u201d Rep. John Bell of Wayne County, a co-chair of the House Helene recovery committee, told colleagues. \u201cBut this is a starting point, with multiple bills after this to follow.\u201d",
      "The competing proposals both include $150 million to kickstart a home reconstruction and repair program in the mountains while they await federal funds for the same purpose to aririve. And they both contain money \u2014 albeit in different amounts \u2014 to help farmers and to rebuild private roads and bridges.",
      "North Carolina state officials reported over 100 deaths from Helene with 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads damaged. State officials projected the late September storm caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "Bell told reporters that the $500 million figure could rise as Senate counterparts get involved in negotiations later. But he said the House would act strategically to maximize federal matching funds and to ensure the state doesn't repeat errors from previous hurricane recovery efforts.",
      "Bell cited the program developed in the preceding administration of Gov. Roy Cooper to rebuild homes after Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018. The program still needs $217 million to finish construction on more than 1,100 eastern North Carolina homes.",
      "Committee co-chair Rep. Dudley Greene of Avery County, who suffered property damage from Helene, said that western North Carolina still doesn\u2019t know for sure what money will be made available for repairs and how it will be distributed.",
      "\u201cHopefully, this is a first step in trying to alleviate some of that confusion,\u201d Greene said.",
      "Creating a consensus plan will pose an early test of Stein\u2019s relationship with Republican lawmakers, who control the legislature but narrowly lack a veto-proof majority following the November elections.",
      "The House committee was expected to consider amendments next week, with a floor vote soon after. Senate Republicans filed their own placeholder disaster relief bill on Wednesday.",
      "The House bill omits entirely Stein's request for $150 million for two business grant programs designed to provide up to $75,000 to companies that suffered significant sales and economic losses and or physical damages.",
      "Many Republicans previously have expressed reservations about the state providing direct grants to businesses, rather than loans. Bell told reporters that a grant program could surface later in the bill process.",
      "The House package also does not contain Stein's $100 million request to recompense local governments in the mountains for lost or spent revenues nor his $34 million appeal to provide summer school in public school districts that lost at least 15 instructional days shortly after Helene\u2019s rampage.",
      "Stein said this week that funds are needed now to prevent more business closings, housing construction delays and students falling behind academically."

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Pam Bondi was sworn in Wednesday as attorney general, taking charge of the Justice Department as it braces for upheaval with President Donald Trump aiming to exert his will over an agency that has long provoked his ire.",
      "The ceremony took place in the Oval Office and it was the first time that the Republican president had participated in a second-term swearing-in of a Cabinet member. It was further evidence of Trump\u2019s intense personal interest in the operations of the department that investigated him during his first term and then brought two since-abandoned indictments after he left office in 2021.",
      "Before Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas administered the oath of office, Trump praised Bondi's record as a prosecutor and said she will restore \u201cfair, equal and impartial justice at the department.\u201d",
      "Bondi told the president that she would not let him down. \u201cI will make you proud and I will make this country proud,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI will restore integrity to the Justice Department and I will fight violent crime throughout this country and throughout this world, and make America safe again,\" Bondi said.",
      "The Senate confirmed Bondi, who was Florida's first female attorney general before becoming a lobbyist, in a 54-46 vote Tuesday that was almost entirely along party lines. The lone Democrat to join Republicans was Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman.",
      "Republicans say Bondi will bring much-needed change to a department they believe unfairly pursued Trump through investigations and mistreated his supporters who were prosecuted in connection with the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "As attorney general Bondi will oversee the FBI, which is in turmoil over the scrutiny of agents involved in Trump-related investigations. He has made clear his desire to go after his perceived adversaries."

      "A U.S. military plane carrying 104 deported Indian migrants arrived Wednesday in a northern Indian city, the first such flight to the country as part of a crackdown ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "The lawmakers and media reports said the deportees\u2019 arms and legs were shackled while on the aircraft. Parliament's proceedings were adjourned Thursday as the lawmakers chanted slogans and demanded a discussion about the deportation.",
      "Renuka Chowdhury, a lawmaker in the Congress party, said the deportees were \u201chandcuffed, had their legs chained and even struggled to use the washroom.\u201d",
      "Her colleague, Gaurav Gogoi, called it \u201cdegrading.\u201d",
      "Parliament Speaker Om Birla tried to calm the lawmakers, saying the transportation of the deportees was a matter of U.S. foreign policy and that the U.S. \"also has its own rules and regulations.\u201d",
      "One deportee, Jaspal Singh, said their handcuffs and leg chains were taken off only at the Amritsar airport in India.",
      "Singh, 36, said they initially thought they were being taken to another camp in the U.S and only found out about their deportation once on the plane. \u201cThe flight was into 8-9 hours and an officer informed (us) that we are being deported\u201d to India, he said.",
      "The U.S. government usually carries out deportations on commercial and chartered flights. The use of the U.S. military to return people to their home country is a relatively new method that started under the Trump administration.",

      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to visit Washington next week. President Donald Trump and Modi discussed immigration in a phone call last week and Trump stressed the importance of India buying more American-made security equipment and fair bilateral trade.",
      "A spokesperson at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi said enforcing immigration laws was critical for the country's national security and public safety.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States to faithfully execute the immigration laws against all inadmissible and removable aliens,\u201d Christopher Elms said.",
      "New Delhi says it opposes illegal immigration, mainly because it is linked to several forms of organized crime, and it has not objected to the U.S. deporting its citizens.",
      "Recent years have seen a jump in the number of Indians attempting to enter the U.S. along the U.S.-Canada border. The U.S. Border Patrol arrested more than 14,000 Indians on the Canadian border in the year ending Sept. 30, which amounted to 60% of all arrests along that border and more than 10 times the number two years ago.",

    "story": [
      "Congress is proving little match for the Department of Government Efficiency as wary lawmakers watch it march through the bureaucracy",
      "WASHINGTON -- When Elon Musk debuted the Department of Government Efficiency recently at the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson enthusiastically predicted the coming Trump administration would bring \u201ca lot of change around here.\u201d",
      "Three weeks in, the change the Trump administration has brought is a disruption of the federal government on an unprecedented scale, dismantling longstanding programs, sparking widespread public outcry and challenging the very role of Congress to create the nation\u2019s laws and pay its bills.",
      "Government workers are being pushed to resign. Entire agencies are being shuttered. Federal funding to states and nonprofits was temporarily frozen. And the most sensitive Treasury Department information of countless Americans was opened to Musk\u2019s DOGE team in an unprecedented breach of privacy and protocol.",
      "\u201cThis is an erosion of our democracy,\u201d said Brian Riedl, a longtime economic adviser to conservative Republicans, now at the Manhattan Institute think tank.",
      "President Donald Trump has tapped Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, to take on inner workings of the world\u2019s oldest democracy, and so far the results are stunning, if not alarming and unlawful, being challenged in dozens of court cases nationwide.",
      "Congress is proving little match for DOGE as wary lawmakers watch it march through the bureaucracy. Instead, a rush of lawsuits is demanding interventions to stop the Republican president's team from unilaterally gutting government. And protests are erupting outside government agencies and clogging the congressional phone lines.",
      "\u201cWhatever DOGE is doing, it is certainly not \u2014 not \u2014 what democracy looks like or has ever looked like in the grand history of this country,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.",
      "\"An unelected shadow government is conducting a hostile takeover of the federal government,\u201d Schumer posted on Musk's social media site X.",
      "Musk responded on his platform: \u201cHysterical reactions like this is how you know that DOGE is doing work that really matters.\u201d",
      "Congress has been here before, tested during Trump\u2019s first term by his willingness to break the norms and skirt the outer banks of legality, most notably when he steamrolled Congress and poached federal military housing and construction funds to build parts of his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "But Trump\u2019s second-term partnership with Musk, who spent some $200 million on Trump's White House bid and employs the tech world ethos of moving fast and breaking things, is escalating the confrontation. On a stated quest to save money by rooting out waste, fraud and abuse, they are making moves to upend American institutions, decimate the civil service and leave a reformed \u2014 or hollowed-out \u2014 federal government in its place.",
      "Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said it would be \u201ccatastrophic to our system of government\u201d if the effort succeeds.",
      "\u201cMany of the things they are doing are brazenly unlawful, and we\u2019ve seen that the courts have been willing to intervene \u2014 and intervene quickly,\u201d Parrott said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real readiness and understanding of the stakes.\u201d",
      "In many ways, Trump is pursuing by force what Republicans have long promised but have been unable to deliver by congressional action: shrinking the size and scope of the federal government. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist quipped more than a decade ago about the goal of making government small enough to drown in a bathtub.",
      "But facing pushback from within their ranks about cutting programs Americans rely upon, Republicans have repeatedly failed to accomplish their budget-slashing goals even when they fully control Congress and the White House, as they do now.",
      "While Congress has the power to pass legislation to fund government operations, the president can veto bills or sign them into law. Instead, Trump is testing an idea championed by his nominee for budget director, Russ Vought, that the executive has the ability to \u201cimpound\u201d federal funds, clawing the money back.",
      "Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said DOGE provides \u201ccover\u201d for some Republicans who want to cut federal funds, when Congress has failed to do so.",
      "And other Republicans say they are comfortable with Trump's pause of certain federal operations, particularly the U.S. Agency for International Development, which sends aid around the world. Closing the Department of Education is next on deck.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got oversight,\u201d said Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. \u201cIf he goes too far, I\u2019ll be the first person to step up.\u201d",
      "Taken together the actions of the administration and DOGE have been swift, relentless and wide open to debate.",
      "Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget's move to abruptly freeze federal grants and loans drew outrage nationwide as states and nonprofit organizations feared being locked out of funds they need to provide housing, health care and other services. A day later, the White House reversed course.",
      "The shutdown of funds to USAID is largely seen as a test case for the Impoundment Control Act, which Vought has discussed using as a way to roll back congressionally approved funding. Vought's nomination is on track for Senate confirmation this week, despite all Senate Democrats saying they will oppose him.",
      "And DOGE dipped into the inner-workings of the Treasury Department to access its payment system \u2014 and the private information of millions of Americans \u2014 in what is widely viewed as a way for the White House to eventually stop federal funds to various entities.",
      "On Monday, U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan said the administration's actions with the federal funding \u201cpotentially run roughshod over a \u2018bulwark of the Constitution\u2019 by interfering with Congress\u2019s appropriation of federal funds.\u201d",
      "\u201cDefendants\u2019 actions appear to suffer from infirmities of a constitutional magnitude,\" she wrote, extending an order issued last week that had paused OMB's sweeping funding freeze. \u201cThe appropriation of the government\u2019s resources is reserved for Congress, not the Executive Branch. And a wealth of legal authority supports this fundamental separation of powers.\u201d",
      "Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said what gives her pause now is how Congress moves forward with legislation to fund the government by the upcoming March 14 deadline.",
      "\u201cWhat if we do all that and come to an agreement ... vote it in \u2014 and this administration says, 'That's bunk. We don't have to go by that,'\u201d she said. \u201cSo the level of trust is at the lowest I have ever seen it here.\u201d",
      "Asked if the administration could do what it's doing, Johnson, the speaker, insisted, \"There will be an appropriate action for Congress to take, but we haven\u2019t yet sorted out what\u2019s happening with it.\u201d",
      "Pressed if Trump had the authority to shut agencies, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t have all the answers.\u201d",

      "Two fired board members have issued statements saying they were removed last week by Archbishop Gregory Aymond of the Archdiocese of New Orleans after resisting pressure to channel as much as $16 million to support the church's long-running bankruptcy negotiations with hundreds of sexual abuse survivors.",

      "Jayroe did not respond to a request for comment sent via LinkedIn Wednesday.",

      "Aymond appointed Dirk Wild, the archdiocese's chief financial officer, as interim CEO and named three new board members. Second Harvest's priority is to \u201censure day-to-day operations will remain on schedule and services will continue uninterrupted,\u201d Aymond and Wild said in a joint statement released last week.",
      "Wild did not respond to text messages or phone calls requesting comment Wednesday. Archdiocese of New Orleans Communications Director Sarah McDonald declined to comment.",

      "James Adams, a survivor of clergy abuse who has sued the archdiocese, said Aymond could \u201ceasily remove\u201d the food bank from his control and allow the nonprofit to carry on its work unimpeded.",
      "\u201cThe survivors just want this matter settled,\u201d Adams said of the abuse lawsuits. \u201cThe archdiocese is leaving their creditors with no choice if they wish to try and come to a settlement but to go to all the assets that are under the control of the archbishop.\"",
      "Aymond has rebuffed calls by survivors of abuse to resign as the New Orleans church has faced federal investigations and scrutiny over its failure to take action on credible allegations against priests going back decades. An investigation by The Associated Press also exposed the role of executives with the NFL's New Orleans Saints in helping the church engage in damage control.",

      "CIA employees have gotten letters offering them buyouts if they voluntarily resign",
      "WASHINGTON -- The CIA confirmed on Wednesday that it has offered buyouts to employees who voluntarily resign, the latest group of workers targeted in President Donald Trump's push to transform the federal government.",
      "A CIA spokesperson declined to say how many people received offers or whether they face any deadline to decide.",
      "Trump's Office of Personnel Managemen t already has offered millions of federal workers about eight months of salary if they agree by Thursday to leave their jobs. The CIA and other national security agencies were initially exempted, but the CIA offers suggest few corners of the government will escape Trump's overhaul.",
      "Trump has long criticized America's intelligence agencies, and his new CIA director, John Ratcliffe, has promised big changes, claiming the CIA has strayed from its original focus on human-collected intelligence.",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, the CIA said the buyout offers are part of an effort by Ratcliffe to move swiftly \"to ensure the CIA workforce is responsive to the Administration\u2019s national security priorities.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese moves are part of a holistic strategy to infuse the Agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position the CIA to deliver on its mission,\" the agency said about the buyouts, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "Since taking office last month Trump has launched an attempt to gut and reshape several federal agencies, most notably the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has been largely dismantled by Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, the leader of Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "National security experts have warned that deep cuts to the CIA and other agencies could put lives at risk by hampering their mission or reducing the flow of intelligence between the U.S. and its allies. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, urged CIA employees to carefully weigh the offer.",
      "\u201cThere are few government agencies more essential to our national security than the CIA,\u201d Warner said in a statement. \"A lot of federal employees, including at the CIA, are my constituents, and I\u2019ve been warning them that these \u2018buyouts\u2019 are empty promises, since Congress hasn\u2019t approved any money to do it. I\u2019d hate to see people resign and then get stiffed like the contractors on President Trump\u2019s construction projects.\u201d",
      "Though the precise number is classified, the CIA employs thousands of people engaged in the collection and analysis of foreign intelligence, both at its headquarters in Virginia as well as overseas postings.",
      "Ratcliffe told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee in January that the CIA must do a better job of harnessing technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing while also expanding the agency\u2019s use of human intelligence collection.",
      "\"We\u2019re not where we\u2019re supposed to be,\u201d Ratcliffe said as senators considered his nomination."

      "ATLANTA -- Conservatives\u2019 nationwide offensive against transgender care, earlier focused on young people, is increasingly trying to cut off access for transgender adults.",
      "With 2025 state legislative sessions still young, bills have been introduced to cut off public funding for gender affirming care for adults in at least 10 states. Georgia became the first state to move forward this year, with a panel voting 6-3 Tuesday to advance a bill to the full Senate despite pleas from public employees who would lose insurance benefits.",
      "\u201cIt is a slap in the face to reward that service by stripping us of the health care access that we desperately need,\u201d said Carrie Scott, a lawyer for the state and transgender woman.",
      "The panel voted hours after a Georgia county asked an appeals court to overturn an order to pay for gender affirming care for a sheriff\u2019s deputy.",
      "Other states have already tried to restrict care for transgender adults. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, vetoed a bill last year that would have banned Medicaid spending on some gender affirming care. Former Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, tried to impose restrictions on adult care before his executive order was rolled back. And a 2023 Florida law requires physicians to oversee health care related to transitioning, mandating in-person appointments.",
      "This year, bills have been introduced not only in Georgia, but Arizona, Connecticut, Kentucky, Montana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia.",
      "LGBTQ+ advocates say Republican legislators are emboldened by President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders targeting transgender and nonbinary people. Former President Joe Biden, by contrast, supported transgender rights.",

      "\u201cWhat this bill says is we are not going to spend state taxpayer dollars on transgender surgeries in our state,\" Republican Sen. Blake Tillery of Vidalia, the sponsor, told the Senate Insurance and Labor Committee.",
      "Earlier Tuesday in a nearby courtroom, Houston County Sheriff's Sgt. Anna Lange watched as lawyers clashed before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals over whether her county\u2019s insurance plan must keep paying gender affirming care benefits she won through a federal suit.",
      "\u201cTrans people are people, and we deserve to be treated just like everybody else,\u201d Lange said afterward.",
      "Like Lange, Georgia state employees sued for benefits, with advocates winning settlements covering public university employees, Medicaid beneficiaries and state employees.",
      "Scott and Khara Hayden, a transgender woman who is an information technology specialist, both testified they might leave state employment if benefits end on Jan. 1, 2026, as the bill proposes.",
      "\u201cIf you approve this bill, essentially you\u2019re going to take away the care I need to continue living,\" Hayden testified, saying a lack of hormone therapy would force her into early menopause.",
      "The bill may have trouble passing the Georgia House, though.",
      "State House Speaker Jon Burns, a Newington Republican, repeated again Tuesday that the only transgender-related legislation he backs this year is a bill to ban transgender girls and women from playing school and college sports. He said he foresees a \u201cvery narrow focus\u201d on that measure.",
      "The health bill explicitly blames Republican Attorney General Chris Carr for settling the state employees\u2019 lawsuit in 2023. Tillery, the bill\u2019s sponsor, is an ally of Republican Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, who is expected to run for governor in 2026 against Carr.",
      "Carr has rejected the idea that he favors benefits for transgender people, with spokesperson Kara Murray saying he has a \u201clong track record\u201d of opposing them.",
      "The state and employees who litigated for benefits are divided on whether a new law could reverse legal settlements. Plaintiffs say they made binding contracts, which includes a provision saying the state won\u2019t reimpose the prohibition. But Tillery argues each year is a new health insurance contract and the state can change the terms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our proper duty to write the law and it\u2019s the court\u2019s duty to interpret that law,\" Tillery said.",
      "Even if the state can scrap the settlements, opponents say they'd sue again to strike down unconstitutional denial of benefits to transgender people because of their sex. The Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that under a 1964 civil rights law, employers couldn't discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender employees \u201cbecause of sex.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s discriminatory, 100%, that they\u2019re specifically targeting the transgender individuals and the care that they need,\u201d Hayden said."

      "If your financial goals are hard to pin down, or seem to drift, you\u2019re not alone",
      "What are your top financial goals?",
      "If your goals are hard to pin down, or seem to drift, you\u2019re not alone.",
      "Research suggests that, even when considering important goals, people tend to answer with whatever is top-of-mind, which may not always reflect their true, long-term goals.",
      "It can be helpful to implement ready-made processes that help us be less of a stranger to ourselves and better understand our deeper motivations, rather than fixate on top-of-mind recollections.",
      "We\u2019ve used our research to inform a three-step process that can help investors more strategically identify their financial goals. This process forces investors to slow down and consider the topic holistically.",
      "In practice, it provides the space and structure that people benefit from as they think deeply about what they want to do over the long term with their hard-earned resources. Here\u2019s what the steps look like.",
      "First, take out a notepad and write down your top three investing goals.",
      "Think of this as a brainstorming session, which can be useful to get things rolling. But remember that it\u2019s just the first step, and anything written here should be considered \u201cwritten in pencil.\u201d",
      "Next, set the notepad aside and review an established list of common investing goals. Consider each alternative, and mark off the goals on the list that are important to you. As you go along, cross out goals that don\u2019t resonate with you.",
      "There\u2019s nothing magical about this master list. The benefit is that it gives people a different perspective on what they might be motivated by, and moreover the opportunity to just evaluate options, rather than having to generate ideas and evaluate them at the same time. Doing two things at the same time is hard (think about trying to drive and read a text message simultaneously).",
      "Now, taking both your initial list from the notepad and the marked-up list of common goals into consideration, think about your top three investing goals. Write them down on a new piece of paper. Has your list of top goals changed since Step 1? If so, how?",
      "A simple but effective approach: Build a master list",
      "If your goals changed, you\u2019re not alone. In our research, we found about 70% of people changed at least one of their top three goals after going through this simple three-step process.",
      "After considering the master checklist, some people who initially thought of their goals in broad, vague terms began to formulate ideas that were more specific and vivid. The master list also helped many respondents shift from initial goals that focused solely on financial outcomes (which tend to be impersonal and potentially unmotivating ) to reframe their goals in terms of their emotional and personal values. This process helped them better understand their why (not just their what).",
      "Next time you are faced with the big, scary question of financial planning\u2014\u201cWhat are your overarching, 30-year, long-term financial goals?\u201d\u2014try using the steps above to aid your decision-making and break the problem down into manageable steps. It can help you make sure that you find your true goals, and not just things that are top of mind. This helps investors be less of a stranger to themselves and to identify their whyas they move toward where they want to go.",

      "The former interpreter for baseball star Shohei Ohtani is expected to be sentenced for bank and tax fraud",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The former interpreter for Japanese baseball star Shohei Ohtani is expected to be sentenced Thursday for bank and tax fraud after he stole nearly $17 million from the Los Angeles Dodgers player\u2019s bank account.",
      "Federal prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of four years and nine months for Ippei Mizuhara, who was supposed to bridge the gap between Ohtani and his English-speaking teammates and fans as the duo traveled from Southern California to ballparks across the U.S. Instead, Mizuhara exploited the Japanese-English language barrier to isolate Ohtani and profit from his proximity to the two-way player \u2019s power.",
      "Mizuhara is scheduled to appear in federal court in the Orange County city of Santa Ana. He pleaded guilty last year to bank and tax fraud after he was accused of stealing money to cover his growing gambling bets and debts with an illegal bookmaker, in addition to $325,000 worth of baseball cards and his own dental bills.",
      "The case affected arguably the world\u2019s most famous baseball player \u2014 who previously pitched for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim \u2014 and stoked an international media frenzy. It stemmed from a broader probe into illegal sports bookmaking organizations in Southern California and the laundering of proceeds through casinos in Las Vegas that has netted a dozen defendants.",
      "\u201cHis years-long theft of funds from Mr. Ohtani and the myriad lies he told to Mr. Ohtani\u2019s agents and financial advisors to cover up his theft represent a calculated betrayal of the very person he was hired to help,\u201d prosecutors wrote in court papers.",
      "They want Mizuhara to pay $17 million in restitution to Ohtani and $1 million to the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "In a letter to the court, Mizuhara described his financial strain and addiction to gambling, which he had hoped would alleviate his money problems. He also professed his admiration of Ohtani, and his remorse.",
      "\u201cI am asking for a little mercy from the court concerning my sentence you will hand down,\u201d Mizuhara wrote. \u201cI truly admire Shohei as a baseball player and a human being and I was committed to devote my life so Shohei can be the best version of himself on the field. I want to say I am truly sorry for violating his trust in me.\u201d",
      "Mizuhara accessed Ohtani\u2019s account beginning in 2021 and changed its security protocols so he could impersonate him to authorize wire transfers. By 2024, Mizuhara had used the money to buy about $325,000 worth of baseball cards at online resellers and had bet tens of millions of dollars that weren\u2019t his to wager on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football.",
      "Prosecutors said Mizuhara never bet on baseball, and Ohtani was an unknowing victim of the scheme.",
      "\u201cLet there be no doubt, Mr. Ohtani is truly a victim and has suffered, and will continue to suffer, harm from defendant\u2019s conduct,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Michael G. Freedman, Mizuhara's attorney, wrote in court filings that his client is a gambling addict who made a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d and has suffered from a loss of a job and reputation. Mizuhara takes responsibility for his actions and expects to be deported to his native Japan after serving time, Freedman wrote while asking for a sentence of one and a half years.",
      "Mizuhara was born in Japan and moved to California with his parents when he was 6. He struggled to learn English but eventually did, and he returned to Japan in 2013 to become an interpreter for a Japanese baseball team and later for Ohtani, according to court filings.",
      "The two formed a tight-knit bond, and Mizuhara moved with Ohtani in 2018 to the U.S., where he took on numerous errands for the player such as grocery shopping, Freedman wrote.",
      "Inside baseball, Mizuhara stood by Ohtani\u2019s side for many of the athlete's career highlights, from serving as his catcher during the Home Run Derby at the 2021 All-Star Game, to being there for his two American League MVP wins and his record-shattering $700 million, 10-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "Off the field, Mizuhara was Ohtani\u2019s friend and confidant. He famously resigned from the Los Angeles Angels during the 2021 MLB lockout so he could keep speaking to Ohtani, and he was rehired after a deal was struck.",
      "Last year, Ohtani and the Dodgers won the World Series, and the baseball star won his third Most Valuable Player award."

      "The federal office that enforces civil rights at school across the nation has been ordered to prioritize complaints of antisemitism above all else as it molds to President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, raising fears that other rights violations will go unpuni...",
      "WASHINGTON -- The federal office that enforces civil rights at schools across the U.S. has been ordered to prioritize complaints of antisemitism above all else as it molds to President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, raising fears that other rights violations will go unpunished.",
      "Trump\u2019s new leader of the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights told staff this week they will be expected to aggressively pursue complaints involving antisemitism and hew closely to Trump\u2019s wishes, according to sources who were on the call with Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights.",
      "Already there are signs of a hard turn on civil rights enforcement, including new actions focused squarely on anti-Jewish bias and transgender issues.",
      "Responding to a White House order last week, the office launched new antisemitism investigations at five universities including Columbia and Northwestern. Days earlier, it opened an inquiry into Denver public schools over an all-gender bathroom that replaced a girls\u2019 bathroom while leaving another one exclusive to boys. On Wednesday, Trump ordered schools that receive federal money to ban transgender girls from participating in women's sports, promising the Education Department would investigate schools and colleges that don't comply.",
      "The office\u2019s fleet of lawyers have mostly been sidelined while the new administration shifts priorities. Daily work has been frozen, which is typical when a new president takes office, but sources say there\u2019s a new blackout on communication with schools, colleges or those submitting complaints. Questions about how to enforce Title IX go unanswered, leaving schools in the dark as they navigate a new memo from the agency last week.",
      "The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.",
      "In the staff call, Trainor said the office must be more aggressive and faster than it was under former President Joe Biden. He accused the previous administration of neglecting its duty to fight antisemitism, leaving more than 100 cases open. Trump has called for a review of all antisemitism cases opened since Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, including those resolved under Biden.",
      "With a rigid focus on antisemitism and gender identity, there\u2019s fear the office won\u2019t give adequate attention to racial discrimination, mistreatment based on disability, or Islamophobia. The office is required to process all complaints it fields, but politics can play a role in setting priorities and choosing which cases to pursue.",
      "Raymond Pierce, who led the office under Democratic President Bill Clinton, said focusing on antisemitism alone doesn\u2019t fulfill the mission of the office \u2014 to enforce civil rights laws.",
      "\u201cAntisemitism is an issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Civil Rights Act is broader than just religion.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Trainor promised his office \u201cwill vigorously investigate all alleged violations of civil rights laws within its purview.\u201d",
      "Trainor had also warned staff of a coming \u201crestructuring\u201d and acknowledged that Elon Musk\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency is examining the Education Department. It raised worries about staffing cuts in a civil rights office that has seen dwindling numbers even as it received a record 22,687 complaints last year.",
      "Additionally, there\u2019s concern Trump in his quest to shut down the Education Department will slash the office\u2019s budget and move it to the Justice Department, as suggested in the Project 2025 blueprint created by the conservative Heritage Foundation.",
      "The impact of Trump\u2019s changes are most likely to be felt by Black students and those who are disabled, according to lawyers and advocates. For decades, the Office for Civil Rights has worked to force equal access for marginalized students, said Derek W. Black, a law professor at the University of South Carolina.",
      "If the office finds merit in a complaint, it has the power to withhold federal funding until schools or states comply.",
      "\u201cAre there local and state officials who want to do right by kids? Of course, there are,\u201d Black said. \u201cBut are there districts that don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal or don\u2019t want to do right by poor kids? Unfortunately, there are.\u201d",
      "Historically, most complaints to the department have involved disability discrimination, but last year accusations of sex discrimination surged to account for more than half of all complaints, according to an annual report. Disability discrimination accounted for 37%, while discrimination over race or national origin accounted for 19%.",
      "In addition to its duty to investigate complaints, the office creates federal rules to interpret federal law for schools and colleges. That role has been at the center of a political tug-of-war over Title IX, with recent administrations repeatedly rewriting the rules governing investigations of campus sexual misconduct.",
      "The Biden administration issued new rules last year expanding Title IX to protect transgender and LGBTQ+ students, and boosting victims\u2019 rights. A federal judge overturned the rules in January, reverting to a previous set of rules from Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "In a memo to schools and colleges last week, the Office for Civil Rights emphasized that the earlier Trump rules would be enforced, but it created confusion about how to handle cases that were opened when Biden\u2019s rules were in effect. With no communication from the department, there has been little clarity for schools.",
      "There are also questions about how antisemitism investigations will change. Trump has used heated rhetoric to push for more aggressive action against colleges found to have tolerated antisemitism, and Trainor blasted the Biden administration for signing \u201ctoothless\u201d agreements to resolve cases. No new guidance has been issued to lawyers who investigate cases.",
      "As the office awaits orders to resume its work, it faces a growing backlog of complaints.",
      "Before Trump took office, there were more than 140 open investigations involving shared ancestry, many of them dealing with antisemitism or Islamophobia. The Biden administration opened more than 100 investigations after Oct. 7, 2023. A flurry of schools reached deals to settle the cases before Trump took office amid fears that he would issue heavier sanctions.",

      "An Oklahoma board has rejected clemency for a man sentenced to die for fatally shooting a woman during a 2005 home-invasion robbery",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- An Oklahoma board rejected clemency on Wednesday for a man sentenced to die for fatally shooting a woman during a 2005 home-invasion robbery, clearing the way for him to become the first person executed in the state this year.",
      "The Pardon and Parole Board voted 4-1 to deny recommending clemency for Wendell Grissom, 57, who turned down an opportunity to speak to the board via a video link from the State Penitentiary in McAlester. He is scheduled to die by lethal injection on March 20.",
      "Grissom and a co-defendant, Jessie Floyd Johns, were convicted of killing of Amber Matthews, 23, and wounding her friend, Dreu Kopf, at Kopf's Blaine County residence. Johns was sentenced to life in prison without parole.",
      "Grissom's attorneys, federal public defenders Kristi Christopher and Thomas Hird, did not dispute Grissom\u2019s guilt, but argued that he suffered from brain damage that was never presented to a jury. They also told the board Grissom has always accepted responsibility and expressed remorse for Matthews' killing, even writing an apology to the woman's family during his first interview with police.",
      "\u201cHe cannot change the past, but he is now and always has been deeply ashamed and remorseful,\u201d Christopher said.",
      "Grissom's attorneys also said they have spoken to several jurors in the case, including the jury foreman, who said they likely would not have voted for the death penalty if they knew about Grissom's brain damage.",
      "Prosecutors disputed Grissom's attorneys' claims that the killing was due to a lack of impulse control as a result of brain damage. Assistant Attorney General Jennifer Crabb said the men loaded up with firearms and ammunition, bought gloves and made sure there were no men at the house before Grissom started shooting.",
      "Attorney General Gentner Drummond called Matthew\u2019s killing a \u201ctextbook\u201d death penalty case.",
      "\u201cThe crimes committed by Grissom, random, brutal attacks on innocent strangers in the sanctity of their own home, are the very kind that keep people awake at night,\" Drummond said.",
      "The board also heard emotional testimony from Kopf, who said she still carries deep mental and physical scars from the attack, including bullet fragments that remain in her body. She said for years, she called 911 when the doorbell rang or there was a stranger in her neighborhood.",
      "\u201cI lived in a heightened state of fear at all times,\u201d she said tearfully.",
      "Without a clemency recommendation from the board, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt cannot commute Grissom's death sentence. Stitt has granted clemency only once in his six years in office, in 2021, to death row inmate Julius Jones, commuting his sentence to life without parole just hours before Jones was scheduled to receive a lethal injection. Stitt has denied clemency recommendations from the board in four other cases."

      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore says his state must become less reliant on federal jobs and better develop other economic strengths",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, facing budget problems and President Donald Trump\u2019s dramatic efforts to downsize a federal workforce crucial to Maryland's economy, said the state must become less reliant on federal jobs and better develop other economic strengths, during a speech to state lawmakers Wednesday.",
      "Moore, a Democrat mentioned as a rising star in the party and a potential future presidential candidate, described both the state's $3 billion budget deficit and the new administration's first actions as \u201ctwo storms\u201d that have made landfall.",
      "\u201cWe are being tested by an historic fiscal challenge \u2014 the likes that we haven\u2019t seen since the Great Recession \u2014 and if that wasn\u2019t enough, we are now being tested by a new administration in Washington that sows uncertainty and confusion, and chaos,\u201d Moore said.",
      "The Republican president's first weeks back in office have jolted heavily Democratic Maryland by decreeing a federal hiring freeze and proposing a widespread buyout plan that encourages federal workers to quit. There also were confusing executive orders, including one that abruptly froze and then unfroze federal grant funds, as well as other broad changes to the federal government sending shockwaves into a state that neighbors the nation's capital.",
      "\u201cThese ideological moves will have the distinct impact on hurting our middle class, which is already feeling the pinch of inflation,\u201d Moore said. \u201cAnd in a larger sense, and heartbreakingly, these actions mark a shift in a longstanding relationship and longstanding norms between Washington and Maryland \u2014 norms that have been preserved by leaders of both political parties and of all backgrounds.\u201d",
      "Moore, who was mentioned as a possible replacement for then-President Joe Biden last year when he withdrew his reelection bid, said he still hopes to work with the new administration and Republican-led Congress to \u201cdeepen the partnership between Maryland and Washington, D.C., that has benefited our people all across the country for generations and across political ideologies.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut if the policy decisions of these past few weeks are any preview, I fear that our most charitable expectations will be met with harsh realities \u2014 that at a time when our nation needs clarity, we confront chaos,\" the governor said.",
      "\u201cAt a time when our nation needs vision, we confront hysteria,\" Moore added.",
      "Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia have about 20% of the nation\u2019s federal workers. Federal employees represent about 5.7% of Maryland's total employment, compared to 1.9% nationally, according to a 2024 report by Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman's office.",
      "The federal government also supports an ecosystem of private sector suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors in Maryland. Federal procurement provided a $42 billion investment in Maryland businesses in 2022, which represented 10% of the state\u2019s GDP, the report says.",
      "The governor said he has identified \u201cthree lighthouse industries of the future\u201d that he wants to focus on in Maryland, including life sciences, information technology and aerospace and defense.",
      "The governor said the state must close its budget gap in a way that grows the middle class, \u201csupercharges and diversifies our economy\u201d and \u201cbreaks our distinct reliance on Washington.\u201d",
      "Maryland Republicans said the state is underachieving, but not for the reasons mentioned by the governor.",
      "\u201cMaryland families are struggling with their finances, energy costs, higher prices and more because of the expensive policies and overregulation passed by a Democratic Supermajority \u2014 not because of his predecessor or new leadership in Washington,\u201d said state Sen. Steve Hershey, the Maryland Senate minority leader.",
      "Moore has proposed a budget for the next fiscal year that includes higher income tax rates for taxpayers who make $500,000 or more, as well as about $2 billion in spending reductions throughout state government to address a $3 billion deficit. The proposal would create a new 6.25% tax rate for people who make more than $500,000 and a 6.5% rate for taxpayers who make more than $1 million.",
      "For incomes over $350,000, an additional 1% tax would be levied on profits from the sale of stocks and other assets. The governor says 82% of Marylanders will either see a tax cut or no change. He's also proposing a reduction to the state's corporate tax rate."

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 16:11:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Bank boss Andrew Bailey told the BBC it expected to cut rates further but warned the road ahead would be bumpy.",
    "story": [
      "The Bank of England has halved its growth forecast for this year as it cut interest rates to the lowest level for more than 18 months.",
      "The economy is now expected to grow by 0.75% in 2025, the Bank said, down from its previous estimate of 1.5%.",
      "The government has made growing the economy one of its key aims. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC he was \"not satisfied with growth\" and the downgraded forecast \"just spurs us on\".",
      "The new forecast came as the Bank cut interest rates to 4.5% from 4.75%. Its governor, Andrew Bailey, said that rates remain on a downward path.",
      "Mr Bailey said the Bank expected to be able to cut rates further \"but we will have to judge meeting by meeting, how far and how fast\".",
      "\"We live in an uncertain world, and the road ahead will have bumps on it,\" he added.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bailey stressed that the Bank needs to remain \"gradual and careful\" when continuing to cut rates because \"there is a lot more uncertainty\" and because of the predicted rise in inflation.",
      "While it cut its growth forecast for this year, the Bank upgraded its predictions for both 2026 and 2027. The economy is now expected to grow by 1.5% in both of those years, the Bank said, up from 1.25%.",
      "However, it also predicted that higher energy and water bills would push up inflation \"quite sharply\" later this year, and warned there were a number of factors that could affect inflation including possible trade tariffs in the US.",
      "Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is now expected to rise to 3.7% and take until the end of 2027 to fall back to its 2% target.",
      "Last week, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a number of measures to try to boost the UK economy.",
      "However, her decision in last year's Budget to increase employers' National Insurance contributions from April has led to a wave of criticism from businesses, who argue it will push up prices and hit investment and jobs.",
      "Mr Bailey said the impact of the Budget, particularly the looming higher costs of employing people, was feeding through into lower confidence for businesses and households.",
      "\"There's no question that the increase in the cost of employment does have an effect,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"We're very focused on how that increased cost of employment is going to pass through.\"",
      "Sir Keir told the BBC the government would turn the economy around with a focus on \"build baby build\" and by making \"tough decisions whether on planning, on infrastructure, on nuclear\".",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said while the rate cut would be good news for many families and businesses, the government's \"disastrous Budget\" was likely to mean fewer rate cuts this year than expected.",
      "Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said it was \"very worrying\" for the government that the Bank of England has \"really, quite significantly\" downgraded its forecasts for economic growth.",
      "He added that if the official government forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility - changes its forecast in line with the Bank's then \"the chancellor is in big trouble\" when it comes to meeting her self imposed debt rules.",
      "\"That means... the tax revenues the chancellor is relying on are unlikely to come in as expected, and even tougher choices on spending and tax going forward.\"",
      "Mortgage impact",
      "The interest rate cut means that for the 629,000 homeowners on mortgage tracker deals that move in line with the base rate, there will typically be a \u00a329 fall in monthly repayments.",
      "The near 700,000 people on standard variable rate mortgages will have to wait to see if their lender responds.",
      "Those on a fixed mortgage deal will see no immediate change, but there might be cheaper deals available for new and renewing customers.",
      "However, the rate cut is likely to lead to lower returns for savers.",
      "Nicola Price and her husband John have still got 18 months remaining on their current mortgage deal, and welcome lower interest rates as it means they will pay less interest on their next mortgage - if rates remain low.",
      "Nicola wishes for \"certainly no more increases\" and thinks the sweet spot for her would be a rate of around 3%.",
      "However, the couple also see that falling interest rates aren't good news for everyone as their parents \"rely heavily\" on a better interest rate on their savings.",
      "Bank of England cuts interest rates to 4.5%, the lowest level since June 2023",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank said economic growth had been \"broadly flat since March last year\".",
      "The UK economy showed zero growth between July and September.",
      "For the following three months, the Bank of England now expects it to shrink by 0.1% against a previous forecast of 0.3% growth.",

      "Don't mess with Canada - that's the private message to the US from the very top of Ottawa's political system. Just like nearly a century ago with the infamous American Smoot-Hawley tariffs, Canada got its retaliation in to Donald Trump's import taxes very quickly.",
      "While the White House is claiming Canada's pledge to spend $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) on a border protection plan has given it diplomatic victory in its battle over fentanyl traffic, there was very little conceded that was not already planned by America's northern neighbour.",
      "Crucially, both Mexico and Canada were undeterred by a clear threat in Trump's executive orders that any retaliation would lead to higher tariffs on imports into the US.",
      "After consulting each other, Canada and Mexico instead both negotiated a month's pause with Trump.",
      "The returning US president likes making threats of tariffs on most days, and in many directions.",
      "Since his inauguration, these have also been directed at Denmark, Colombia, China, Taiwan, the European Union as well as all of the Brics countries which include Brazil, Russia and India.",
      "The rationale for his tariffs keeps changing and much about this situation defies logical explanation.",
      "So, Mexico, Canada and every other country facing tariffs or the threat of them have to decipher what Trump is really playing at.",
      "And when they've done that, the question for the whole world is whether what we are seeing is an attempt by the US president to rewrite the entire global monetary system - and at what risk to America?",
      "The contradictions",
      "Trump has claimed that fentanyl trafficking was the legal pretext for tariffs, allowing him to bypass Congress and use emergency powers to impose border taxes on Canada, Mexico and China, by declaring an \"unusual or extraordinary threat\".",
      "But while talking about the fentanyl trade, he also referred to Canada's goods trade surplus with the US (which means Canada sells more to the US than it imports), and introduced the idea that Canada should become the \"51st state\" of America.",
      "While any country might demand talks about both illicit and legal trade flows, it is difficult to see how to handle these conversations when there is a parallel threat of continental annexation of a free trade ally which is also part of Nato and one of the Group of Seven (G7) most advanced economies in the world.",
      "A disputed surplus",
      "Europe, meanwhile, seems unwilling to stir the pot as it attempts to work out the president's precise motivations and how this feeds itself into what he decides over Transatlantic tariffs.",
      "Trump's long-standing animus with the EU comes from the bloc's substantial goods trade surplus with the US, arising from areas such as high-end German car exports.",
      "Underlying all of this is a perceived unfairness that other markets are more restrictive against America such as when it comes to the prices paid for US drugs or fines placed on US tech companies.",
      "But if this really is about trade deficits, it is something of a mystery as to why Trump has not yet announced tariffs against the likes of Vietnam, Japan and South Korea - who have far bigger surpluses with the US.",
      "In any case, for Trump to focus solely on goods means that he is willingly ignoring the US's great export - services.",
      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "Best of 'frenemies': Trump's relationship with Europe this time may be very different",
      "Growth at all costs? Why Reeves is in a sudden rush on the economy",
      "I put this precise point to the EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic last month.",
      "He told me: \"Sure, we have a trade surplus in goods, but the US has a trade surplus in services.",
      "\"And on top of it, every year, \u20ac300bn (\u00a3249bn) is flowing across the Atlantic into the American companies from our pension funds, from the saving accounts of the European citizens because they're investing in the US. So I think that it's a pretty balanced relationship.\"",
      "As it happens, the UK trade position with the US is more balanced, a point made to me by the Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds. In fact, on some measures, the US has a surplus with Britain.",
      "Amid the fog of Trump's true intentions,  European negotiators have resorted to stressing co-operation, partnership and deals with the US and studiously avoided directly criticising even the extraordinary suggestion of using tariffs against Nato-ally Denmark over the fate of Greenland.",
      "A negotiating tool",
      "In November 2024, Stephen Miran, before becoming President Trump's White House chief economics advisor, authored a paper laying out further questions that could determine how much more the US should tariff specific countries.",
      "These ranged from an assessment of whether a country applies similar tariffs to the US, suppresses its currency, respects US intellectual property, pays its Nato obligations, votes against the US at the United Nations or its \"leaders grandstand against the US in the international theatre\".",
      "It also talked of forcing other nations \"to choose between facing a tariff on their exports to the American consumer or applying tariffs to their imports from China\", asking: \"Which will they choose?\"",
      "The president himself was pretty clear in his video address to a stunned World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January.",
      "\"Your choice,\" he said to the assembled international executives. Build your goods in American factories with tax incentives, or import into the US from foreign factories and pay tariffs that would raise \"hundreds of billions of dollars and even trillions of dollars\" for the US Treasury.",
      "\"Most of the world has come to understand that Trump does use tariffs as a negotiating tool,\" Stephen Moore, a former Trump economic advisor who recently visited the president, told me.",
      "Across the board",
      "It may be that a part of Trump's logic is very simple: remodel the US tax system so that everything coming into the country attracts a levy but, in return, the public sees income tax rates slashed.",
      "\"By the way, I do think at the end of the day, there will be an across-the-board tariff imposed by Trump,\" says Mr Moore.",
      "\"He's talked about this, that if you're bringing something into the United States whether it's from Britain, whether it's Mexico, Canada, China, Europe, you're going to pay a little bit more but if something is made in the United States, he's going to lower the tax. And to a lot of Americans, that's a very attractive proposition.\"",
      "Mr Moore has suggested a 15% universal tariff on all imports from everywhere in order to fund a cut in income tax rates down to 15%.",
      "A fundamental change",
      "Mr Miran's paper also contains a proposal that led to jaws dropping in global central banks and finance ministries: bring down the value of the dollar in order to boost US industry and exports.",
      "Arranging this would mean a fundamental change to the way the global monetary system operates. But Mr Miran suggests that punitive tariffs could be used as leverage to make reluctant trading partners like Europe and China \"become more receptive\" to the idea.",
      "He suggests that in time there could be a summit of the world's economic powers, where allies and rivals thrash out the revaluation of the dollar, perhaps at the president's Florida residence. It could be known as the Mar-a-Lago Accord.",
      "Early discussions of the idea in international forums have been highly sceptical, recalling the history of similar attempts to manage global currency values.",
      "But it is the recently published concept of the top White House economic advisor. Tariff now, tariff hard and tariff everywhere in order to, in the future, get the world to help bring down the value of the dollar.",
      "Show strength",
      "Such a radical idea comes with risk and already simply with the tariffs, there is a danger for the White House that the US overplays its hand.",
      "Mark Carney, who is frontrunner to replace Justin Trudeau as Canadian Liberal Party leader, and as Prime Minister, at least until an election, has a rather unique approach.",
      "The former governor of both the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada decided to come out punching, ridiculing the fentanyl rationale and telling the BBC that Canada would retaliate \"dollar for dollar\" and that Canadians would \"stand up to a bully\".",
      "He said that the tariff move would rebound on the US economy itself by fuelling inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and crippling the ability of the US to sign trade deals, given they would have effectively ripped up their biggest  - the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - just a few years after the president had personally renegotiated it.",
      "Mr Carney then publicly suggested that Canada removes a subsidy from exports to the US of its oil, and stressed that Canada's green investments might need to be protected from US carbon emissions.",
      "For those countries like the UK trying to avoid tariffs, he had a simple message: \"Good luck\".",
      "The clear sense was that from his own experience of having dealt with Trump at the G20, the way to deal with him was to show strength.",
      "The risk of retaliation",
      "This is partly a calculation that the muted opposition to these policies within the US will not be sustained. Again, the harder, more strategic and more coordinated the retaliation, the more pause for thought it will give big US corporates and some in the competing courts around the President.",
      "Elon Musk, the normally prolific social media poster on his X platform and chief executive of electric vehicle-maker Tesla, was curiously largely quiet about the single biggest move from the president.",
      "He eventually reposted the news from the Mexican president that their tariffs had been delayed.",
      "A leading US tech chief executive told me that his company was already making plans, assuming they would be on the receiving end of retaliatory tariffs.",
      "His hope was that Trump's focus on the rising value of the US stock market would create a natural restraint against excessive tariffs. Some saw the modest fall on the Dow Jones index on Monday as contributing to this week's pauses.",
      "Retaliation is standard procedure in trade wars.",
      "Indeed in the most famous of them all, when US Republicans passed the calamitous 1930s Smoot-Hawley tariffs, Canada was the first to hit back, doing so before the US had even finished legislating. History points to Henry Ford being one of those begging Herbert Hoover to veto the Smoot-Hawley tariffs in 1930.",
      "An integrated industry",
      "And, in 2025, the car industry is one obvious potential tariff loser.",
      "\"It's true to say that there is no such thing as a Canadian auto industry, an American auto industry and a Mexican auto industry,\" says Peter Frise, a professor of mechanical and automotive engineering at the University of Windsor.",
      "\"There are Canadian, American, and Mexican components of a North American auto industry and the integration among the three countries is absolutely foundational to how the industry works.\"",
      "Not only are models like the Honda Civic, which is hugely popular in the US, manufactured in Canada - Prof Frise says \"very few\" cars assembled in the US will not contain some parts that come from across the border. And so, says he adds, tariffs \"would drive up costs for everyone\" - US consumers included.",
      "Others diversify",
      "Another risk for Trump is that as Mr Carney and Mr Sefcovic said, they are all now responding to the direction of US trade policy by diversifying with one another. The EU is busy doing trade deals with Latin America. \"There is huge demand in the outside world for free and fair trade relationships,\" says Mr Sefcovic.",
      "The UK has also restarted trade negotiations with India and the Gulf countries.",
      "Reynolds says that the \"challenging international position\" means the UK has to push its \"genuine competitive advantage\" as the \"most connected market in the world\" with the US, the EU and China.",
      "An extensive and surprising tariff war",
      "The other issue here is that if the direction of travel is a universal tariff, as Trump and his advisors keep suggesting, is there much incentive to try to avoid it?",
      "There is some startling thinking circulating in Trumponomics circles. It is talk of that revenue grab of trillions of dollars that is spooking even allies who think they might escape the tariffs.",
      "It sounds like a wild economic gamble. But such talk is relative, at a time when the US president is putting tariffs on his closest economic G7 and Nato partner over fentanyl, while simultaneously claiming it should become part of the US.",
      "It could be an extensive and surprising tariff war. This week's trade dramas are just early skirmishes.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 00:14:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Global politicians and AI bosses will next week attend a summit to debate the disruptive technology.",
    "story": [
      "As I write, there are a lot of powerful people around the world preparing to make their way to Paris \u2013 and a sense that many of them are holding their breath.",
      "On Monday, against the sumptuous backdrop of the city's 125-year-old Grand Palais, representatives from 80 countries including world leaders, tech bosses, academics and other experts, will gather for a two-day global summit to discuss current progress, and future goals, for the rapidly-evolving, hugely-disruptive technology that is artificial intelligence.",
      "That might be what's on the official agenda of the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit, but there is something else that's breathing fire into this particular talking shop: DeepSeek.",
      "A horse racing fan once told me that the night before a big race, everyone's a winner.",
      "And with China dramatically blowing the AI competition in a new direction with DeepSeek, its super-efficient and super-viral AI assistant, suddenly there's a feeling ahead of the summit that the pole position occupied by the US AI sector, despite its vast wealth and AI infrastructure, might not be quite so out-of-reach after all.",
      "Prof Gina Neff, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, says there is currently \"a vacuum for global leadership on AI\".",
      "Prof Dame Wendy Hall, from Southampton University, agrees. \"DeepSeek made everybody realise that China is a force to be reckoned with,\" says the computer scientist.",
      "\"We don't have to just go along with what the big companies on the West Coast are saying. We need global dialogue.\"",
      "On that front, the timing of the summit could not be better.",
      "Europe also spies an opportunity to make a new bid for the AI crown. One of French President Emmanuel Macron's officials described the summit to journalists as a \"wake up call\" for France and Europe, adding that the bloc must not let the AI revolution \"pass it by\".",
      "Other countries also recognise a potential shifting of AI power in the air. India PM Narendra Modi has confirmed his attendance at this summit \u2013 having not come to previous gatherings.",
      "The US is sending some serious firepower as a defensive signal of its own, including Vice President JD Vance, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Google's Sundar Pichai.",
      "Elon Musk is notably absent from the official guest list, but he will undoubtedly have something to say about it all, whether he's there in person or not.",
      "British Prime Minister Kier Starmer is also reportedly staying away.",
      "There have been two previous summits, the first held in the UK and the second in South Korea. A lot has happened since the AI world gathered for the first time, on the steps of the historic mansion of Bletchley House, in November 2023, and promised to try to maximise the benefits of AI while minimising the risks. For one thing, half of the global population has been to the polls since then.",
      "In Bletchley Park, China's Vice Minister for Science and Technology, Wu Zhaohui attended. But there were whispers that he was kept at arms length, on the grounds of national security.",
      "In Paris, by comparison I expect China to be guests of honour. The country is reportedly sending one of its most senior leaders, Ding Xuexiang, a close ally of President Xi JinPing. There's also a buzz around whether DeepSeek creator Liang Wenfeng will join him.",
      "I asked ChatGPT to list some of AI's notable milestones since the South Korea summit of May 2024. DeepSeek did not make the cut.",
      "Of course there is much more to AI than generative AI like both DeepSeek and ChatGPT - tools that create content like text, images, video. It may well be the most widely accessible to us as consumers. But there are also AI tools that spot disease symptoms, model climate change solutions, develop new formulas for drugs - and that will all be in scope in Paris.",
      "DeepSeek: The Chinese AI app that has the world talking",
      "DeepSeek vs ChatGPT - how do they compare?",
      "China's DeepSeek AI shakes industry and dents America's swagger",
      "Furthermore, the David v Goliath narrative around which the story of DeepSeek hangs does merit further scrutiny. The boss of AI firm Anthropic, Dario Amodei, has written a compelling blog about whether DeepSeek really was built at a fraction of the cost of its US rivals.",
      "We do know that it was built on their shoulders: using a number of Nvidia chips (probably older ones, because of US sanctions) and some opensource AI architecture developed by Meta. In addition, OpenAI has complained that rivals are using its work in order to advance their own (contacts in the creative industries was amused at the irony of this, given that OpenAI products will happily produce output \"in the style of\" individual human creators).",
      "But nonetheless DeepSeek succeeded in shaking up the AI sector in a way not even AI itself might have predicted. And it wiped a lot of money off the value of some of the biggest players in the process. It will almost certainly be a huge topic of conversation all around those Parisian conference rooms.",
      "There's one more theme running through the AI Summit that will be worth keeping an eye on.",
      "The first summit had the word \"safety\" in its title. Some felt the event pushed the narrative too hard and terrified people with dark talk of existential threats.",
      "But it hasn't fallen of the agenda entirely.",
      "As a subject, AI safety is a rather broad church. It can relate to any number of risks: the generation and spread of misinformation, displays of bias and discrimination against individuals or races, the ongoing development by multiple countries of AI-controlled weapons, the potential for AI to create unstoppable computer viruses.",
      "Prof Geoffrey Hinton, often described as one of the Godfathers of AI, says these as \"short-term risks\". They might be up for discussion in Paris, but he argued on BBC Radio 4's Today programme last week that they are unlikely to garner strong international collaboration in the long term.",
      "The big scenario which he believes will really pull everyone together is the prospect of AI becoming more intelligent than humans \u2013 and wanting to seize control.",
      "\"Nobody wants AI to take over from people,\" he says. \"The Chinese would much rather the Chinese Communist Party ran the show than AI.\"",
      "Prof Hinton compared this eventuality to the height of the Cold War, when the US and Russia \"just about succeeded\" in collaborating in order to prevent global nuclear war.",
      "\"There's no hope of stopping [AI development],\" he said. \"What we've got to do is to try to develop it safely.\"",
      "Prof Max Tegmark, founder of the Future of Life Institute, also share a stark warning. \"Either we develop amazing AI that helps humans, or uncontrollable AI that replaces humans,\" he says.",
      "\"We are unfortunately closer to building AI than to figuring out how to control it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Norwegian energy giant Equinor is halving investment in renewable energy over the next two years while increasing oil and gas production.",
      "Chief executive Anders Opedal said that the transition to lower carbon energy was moving slower than expected, costs had increased, and customers were reluctant to commit to long term contracts.",
      "Mr Opedal told the BBC he was confident that Rosebank - a giant new oil field in the North Sea - would go ahead, despite a recent court ruling that consent had been awarded unlawfully.",
      "He also warned that gas prices could rise next winter as European gas storage levels were lower now than this time last year.",
      "\"We are scaling down our investments in renewables and low carbon solutions because we don't see the necessary profitability in the future,\" Mr Opedal said.",
      "It will cut investments in renewables to $5bn over the next two years, down from about $10bn.",
      "It will also drop a target to spend half of its fixed assets budget on renewables and low carbon products by 2030.",

      "Rosebank 'not straightforward'",
      "The controversial Rosebank oil field is thought to hold 500 million barrels of oil.",
      "A Scottish court recently ruled that consent had been granted unlawfully as the application did not account for the full environmental impact of the project.",
      "Many within the UK government - including the Energy Secretary Ed Miliband - are opposed to it.",
      "Mr Opedal acknowledged it was a divisive issue but insisted it was good for the UK economy.",
      "\"This is an important project for us. It provides local jobs in Scotland, local jobs in the UK, so we think this project will move forward,\" he said. \"We think that Western Europe and the UK should produce the oil and gas it uses instead of being dependent on other countries outside Europe.\"",
      "Climate campaigners and the oil industry both claimed victory at the Supreme Court ruling as although the consent was revoked, the court allowed preparatory work to continue on Rosebank while new consents are sought.",
      "The government said it has \"already consulted\" on emissions from burning extracted oil and gas, and will incorporate the results of the consultation when making revisions to environmental guidance.",
      "\"Our priority is to deliver a fair, orderly and prosperous transition in the North Sea in line with our climate and legal obligations, which drives towards our clean energy future of energy security, lower bills, and good, long-term jobs,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Tessa Khan, from the environmental campaign group Uplift which, along with Greenpeace, brought judicial reviews to stop the development of Rosebank, said Equinor was getting ahead of itself.",
      "\"I think it's in the industry's interest to make it sound like it's a tick box exercise to get Rosebank over the line,\" she said.",
      "\"There is a regulatory process that needs to be satisfied, and there are very strong public interest arguments against developing Rosebank, so we don't think it will be a straightforward decision at all.\"",
      "She added that new oil and gas fields will not bring down UK bills or improve UK energy security, as renewables would, because the oil is drilled and sold for export.",
      "\"I think we should be honest about whether or not oil and gas companies are good faith partners in the energy transition and interested in lowering people's energy bills. I think the answer now is very clearly 'no',\" she said.",

      "Equinor follows other energy companies in reducing investment in renewables. Shell and BP have both scaled back their future plans.",
      "Mr Opedal appeared to welcome Donald Trump's invitation to the industry to \"drill, baby, drill\" but said energy prices, not the US president, would dictate future exploration and production.",
      "\"When I hear 'drill, baby, drill', I see that as a positive sentiment to the oil and gas business but I think companies will always decide on drilling programs based on price signals,\" said Mr Opedal.",
      "\"If prices go down, less wells will be drilled, if it goes up, more will be drilled.\"",
      "When asked how this was compatible with his target to make Equinor net zero by 2050, he conceded that drilling more now would make it harder in later years.",
      "Mr Opedal also warned that low levels of gas storage in Europe as it exits this winter could mean higher prices next year.",
      "\"Gas storage levels will be lower this spring, meaning that Europe will need to fill up larger amounts of gas to keep it at the same level,\" Mr Opedal added. \"The increase in underlying demand for gas from China means more competition for energy which has the potential to increase prices.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 15:05:38 GMT",
    "summary": "Are we seeing the opening moves in a wider trade war, and what are the potential economic consequences?",
    "story": [
      "Just a day ago, Donald Trump was threatening a multi-front trade war with Canada, Mexico and China that would take the global economy into uncharted territory.",
      "Twenty-four hours later, we're in a rather different place with the tariffs - or taxes - against America's closest neighbours and trading partners on hold for 30 days.",
      "But the 10% tariffs on all goods imports from China have gone ahead, and Beijing has responded in kind. So what are the potential economic consequences of these opening salvos and could this turn into a broader trade war?",
      "Trump's 10% tariff on China begins as Beijing plans retaliation on US energy and some cars",
      "Trump's trade war with neighbours is delayed - what did they all get out of it?",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "China is subject to significant US tariffs already and has been since Trump's first term. But the blanket nature of today's new levies from the White House on every single goods import from China - from toys, to mobile phones, to clothes - is new and significant.",
      "Beijing's promised tariff retaliation - including new levies on imports from the US of oil, agricultural machinery and some cars - is far less sweeping. Yet the retaliation moves us into the arena of tit-for-tat action, where the country experiencing the tariffs feels it has no choice but to hit back to show its own citizens it can't be pushed around by a foreign power.",
      "This is the dictionary definition of a trade war - and economic historians warn they tend to generate their own momentum and can rapidly spiral out of control.",
      "Trump has used just about every justification under the sun for tariffs, from raising more tax revenue to boosting American manufacturing and rebalancing trade. But one thing recent days confirm is the new president regards them as a powerful way to compel other nations to do what he wants.",
      "He threatened massive and punitive tariffs on Colombia when it initially refused to accept US flights of its deported nationals, but he lifted the threat when Bogota acquiesced.",
      "The White House might also point to the response of Mexico and Canada yesterday as evidence tariff threats yield results. He had threatened to ride roughshod over his own North American free trade deal unless those nations tightened up on border control. Although how much extra those two countries actually promised yesterday on border security relative to what they were already doing is open to question.",
      "Yet the problem with the White House using tariff threats in this way is that if other countries don't back down - or agreements are not reached - Trump might well feel he has no choice but to follow through or risk losing all credibility. And the targeted country might feel it has to respond with its prepared countermeasures, even if they would prefer not to.",
      "That high-risk dynamic - where things could slip out of control in an atmosphere of distrust and political pressure - is why many analysts and economists are far from comforted by how things have played out with Mexico and Canada this week.",
      "The other reason many economists fear Trump's intimidatory tariff diplomacy is its potentially chilling impact on business investment and confidence. US car firms have a deeply integrated industrial base across America, Mexico and Canada. Automotive parts cross those borders multiple times in the vehicle assembly process.",
      "The levying of 25% tariffs on each of those movements would be disastrous for these businesses. Those North American tariffs have been paused for now, but it's very hard to see US or Canadian automotive executives committing to further investment in those cross-border supply chains any time soon - and perhaps for many years to come.",
      "That will have negative implications for their productivity - and also for the wages of their employees in all three countries. The view of many economists is having cross-border supply chains makes these firms more productive than they would otherwise be and this raises US workers' wages relative to where they would be if they only manufactured in America.",
      "These same effects apply on a global scale. In light of Trump's tariff threats against the European Union, how many US firms are likely to be going ahead with planned investments in Europe - and vice versa?",
      "Countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia benefitted indirectly from the US tariffs imposed on China in Donald Trump's first presidential term, as multinationals shifted manufacturing out of China and into their territories to avoid the taxes and to continue exporting to America. But what if Trump now threatens tariffs against them too?",
      "The huge uncertainty Trump's tariff threats have injected into the global economy - even if they don't always translate into actual new taxes - will likely already be doing damage.",

      "In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade.",
      "If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures.",
      "Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a35.2bn.",
      "While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them.",
      "How else could the UK be affected?",
      "There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries.",
      "Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects.",
      "If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive.",
      "\"The US imposing tariffs on our other trading partners will still have a negative effect on the UK economy through its effect on supply chains and the exchange rate,\" said Ahmet Kaya, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).",
      "Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025.",

      "Some analysts say higher US interest rates as a result of the tariffs could also spill over to UK borrowing markets.",
      "One of the reasons UK government borrowing costs, or Gilt yields, temporarily spiked upwards in January, was because American government bond yields had also risen.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 23:18:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Economists warn that the introduction of tariffs could lead to prices rising on a wide range of products.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has hit the pause button - for now, at least - on imposing tariffs against imports from US neighbours Canada and Mexico.",
      "Last-minute agreements with the leaders of Mexico and Canada have suspended for a month a tit-for-tat trade war in North America.",
      "The three trade partners have deeply integrated economies and supply chains, with an estimated $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders daily.",
      "Trump says he wants to protect American industry, but many economists warn such tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, who may choose to pass the cost on to customers directly, or to reduce imports, which would mean fewer products available.",
      "So what could get more expensive if Trump's tariffs do eventually go ahead?",
      "Cars",
      "Cars would probably go up in price - by about $3,000 according to TD Economics.",
      "That's because parts cross the US, Canadian and Mexican borders multiple times before a vehicle is assembled.",
      "As a result of higher taxes paid on the importing of parts to build the cars, it is likely the costs will be passed on to customers.",
      "\"Suffice it to say that disrupting these trends through tariffs... would come with significant costs,\" said Andrew Foran, an economist at TD Economics.",
      "He added \"uninterrupted free trade\" in the car-making sector had \"existed for decades\", which had led to lower prices for consumers.",
      "Trump agrees to pause tariffs on Canada and MexicoWhat are tariffs and will prices go up?",
      "Trump agrees to pause tariffs on Canada and Mexico",
      "What are tariffs and will prices go up?",
      "Beer, Tennessee whiskey and tequila",
      "Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.",
      "However, it's also possible that rather than passing on the cost increase, firms could just import less.",
      "Modelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now.",
      "It's more complex when it comes to spirits. The sector has been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s. Industry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\".",
      "They say that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are \"recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises. The trade bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in all three countries.",
      "Houses",
      "Imports of Canadian lumber would be hit by import tariffs to the US. Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".",
      "However, the National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs \"because of their harmful effect on housing affordability\".",
      "The industry body has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",
      "\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.",
      "Maple syrup",
      "When it comes to the trade war with Canada, the \"most obvious\" household impact would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson, associate professor of economics at the London School of Economics.",
      "Canada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",
      "\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" Mr Sampson said.",
      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but that are produced using inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",
      "Fuel prices",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November last year came from Canada.",
      "While 25% has been slapped on Canadian goods imported to the US, its energy faces a lower 10% tariff.",
      "Now the US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but the type its refineries are designed to process means it depends on so-called \"heavier\" - i.e. thicker - crude oil from mostly Canada and some from Mexico.",
      "\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.",
      "That means if Canada decided in retaliation to any US tariffs to reduce crude oil exports, that could lead to prices rising at the petrol pumps.",
      "Avocados",
      "One food import that American consumers could see a significant price increase in is avocados. Grown primarily in Mexico due to its warm, humid climate, Mexican avocados make up nearly 90% of the US avocado market each year.",
      "However, if tariffs come into force, the US Agriculture Department has warned that the cost of avocados - along with popular avocado-based dishes like guacamole - could surge, especially by Super Bowl Sunday on 9 February.",
      "What about goods in Canada?",
      "Before Trump's agreement with Justin Trudeau to pause tariffs was announced on Monday, Canada had threatened retaliatory import taxes.",
      "An initial C$30bn tranche had been due to begin on Tuesday - meaning prices would have probably increased for consumers north of the border as well.",
      "Ottawa had released a list of all the US imports that would have immediately been targeted with matching 25% tariffs. They included grocery store staples, like oranges - a produce that Canada cannot grow in abundance due to its cooler climate.",
      "Alcohol originating from the US would also be harder for Canadians to find. Provinces like Ontario, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia said they would pull all American booze off their shelves starting on Tuesday.",
      "Any US alcohol - including beer and wine - that Canadians could find would likely see a price increase, as it's on the menu for retaliatory tariffs.",
      "Canadian shoppers might feel the pinch from a weaker Canadian dollar if shopping online.",

    "story": [
      "Thames Water will seek approval for an emergency cash lifeline in court on Monday as it faces running out of money in four weeks' time.",
      "Lenders to the debt-saddled company are offering up to \u00a33bn in additional short-term loans to buy time to complete a major restructuring of the UK's biggest water and waste company.",
      "Failure to secure approval will see Thames edge closer to a temporary nationalisation, which could cost the government some \u00a32bn a year.",
      "The company is still considering whether to appeal against a decision by the water industry regulator Ofwat to increase bills by 35% above inflation over the next five years \u2013 short of the 53% increase it applied for.",
      "Thames Water has been struggling for some time and has been heavily criticised over its performance following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "The dire state of the company's finances emerged about 18 months ago when it began a search for funding to avoid collapse.",
      "The Thames fiasco is a combination of poor historical regulation, greedy shareholders, climate change and management failure. Its debt pile is currently about \u00a317bn.",
      "But regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies to households will continue as normal.",
      "In the latest bid to survive, lenders have offered Thames a further loan of up to \u00a33bn in two instalments.",
      "The first payment is to get it through to the autumn, and a second is to be used if the company decides to appeal against Ofwat's 35% bill rise to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) - a process that could take up to a year.",
      "The company has until 18 February to launch an appeal to the CMA.",
      "Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?",
      "The water industry is in crisis. Can it be fixed?",
      "Investment bank Rothschild is also soliciting bids to take over the company and inject much-needed funds.",
      "The court hearing on Monday is scheduled for four days with a possible extension as a much smaller group of lenders is challenging the terms of the lifeline and proposing an alternative.",
      "Although Thames will not collapse immediately if the deal is not approved by the judge, insiders have acknowledged that the company will move a step closer to temporary nationalisation \u2013 a so-called Special Administration Regime \u2013 if it fails.",
      "The government has already sounded out a number of consultancies to take that on if the situation arises.",
      "The company has been keen to stress that whatever happens, its services to 16 million customers would continue uninterrupted, but big questions about the future of Thames and other key infrastructure providers have been thrown up.",
      "Some argue that Thames should be allowed to go bust and have the government take over the company due to it being the architect of its own misfortune. Previous owners loaded the company with debt, took out big dividends and paid executives handsomely. Caving in to its demands for customers to pay more now for a failing service would be a gross injustice.",
      "Others say that poor regulation has allowed this mess. Bills were kept too low for too long which hampered investment in the aging infrastructure that is now being overwhelmed by a wetter climate. Ofwat is fighting yesterday's battle and making things worse by imposing fines of tens of millions of pounds for failures, thus further depriving the company of the funds to fix the very things it is being fined for.",
      "What Thames and ministers both agree on is that neither want this sprawling company on the government's books. Consultancy Teneo has predicted a temporary nationalisation would cost up to \u00a32bn a year.",
      "However, a wider, perhaps more important argument made by some is that the failure of Thames as a private company would send an unhelpful message to the international investors that Chancellor Rachel Reeves hopes will invest hundreds of billions in UK airports, wind farms, rail links and everything else on her long shopping list of growth-boosting projects.",
      "Sources close to the company and its creditors argue that we cannot agonise over and regulate for past mistakes. We are where we are - between a rock and a hard place. Carve out a special deal for Thames - or risk its collapse.",
      "Thames has just over two weeks to appeal to the CMA to bump up the bills it's allowed to charge. It's not without risk - the CMA could revise them down.",
      "Last week, the chair of the CMA was forced out by ministers unimpressed by the regulator's focus on growth. Thames says it needs higher bills to invest \u00a320bn over the next five years. It will be an interesting test case for the new chair."

    "summary": "The African nation exports its cashews in raw form, but processing them would be more lucrative.",
    "story": [
      "The Accra street vendor looks at me, bemused.",
      "I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p).",
      "That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up.",
      "The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer.",
      "\"It's incredible,\" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning.",
      "The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy.",
      "Cashing in on Ghana's cashews",
      "Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second.",
      "To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews.",
      "Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them.",
      "He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult.",
      "\"We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,\" he says. \"I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry.\"",
      "He tells me that he currently gets around $50 for a large 100kg sack of unshelled cashews.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. \"Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne.\"",
      "As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews.",
      "Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year.",
      "Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana.",
      "\"If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,\" she complains. \"As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies.\"",
      "She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs.",
      "It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself.",
      "Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders.",
      "Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer.",
      "More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms.",
      "But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies.",
      "\"In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,\" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. \"You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class\".",
      "Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses.",
      "Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews.",
      "\"These firms are dealing with workforces that aren't properly skilled, they have infrastructures that aren't working, they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials, or rule changes, and also it's very difficult to reach foreign markets, he says. \"They need the foreign market because the domestic market is small, and their own government has very little capacity [to boost it].\"",
      "He also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation.",
      "But Mr Simons reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves, to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews. As it is, he says, many of the country's most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive.",
      "\"There's a massive brain drain,\" he says. \"My theory of why Africa's economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side, but the real beauty is in demand, creating a consuming class of cashew-eating enthusiasts, and you don't have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation.\"",
      "He says the same argument applies to Ghana's other bigger exports, like gold and chocolate, neither of which gets much value-addition within Ghana before getting exported to the West.",
      "Mildred Akotia hopes she might be one of those entrepreneurs to buck the trend. She now wants to build her own logistics arm, to be able to process the cashews direct from the farm gate.",
      "\"I have a lot of calls from the UAE, from Canada and America. Currently we can't meet demand. We can't get enough kernels to roast.",
      "\"There's a ready market both locally and internationally. My branding is good, my marketing is good. My dream is to give a facelift to Ghanaian processed foods.\"",

      "Amandaland, the new BBC series which is a spin-off from the popular sitcom Motherland, has received a rapturous response from critics.",
      "The show sees Lucy Punch reprise her role as Amanda, the overbearing and competitive mother who was a viewer favourite in the original series.",
      "The Independent said the new spin-off \"will make you howl with laughter\", adding that English actress Punch \"has never been better\".",
      "The Telegraph described it as being \"both hilarious and heartfelt\", adding that lead actress Punch and co-star Dame Joanna Lumley \"make a dream comic double act\".",
      "In the show, the recently divorced Amanda must navigate parenting teenagers in her new surroundings, after having downsized, swapping Waitrose in Chiswick for Tesco Metro in South Harlesden in the process.",
      "\"Spin-offs are always a risk, but Lucy Punch's Amanda was a sure bet,\" wrote the Guardian's Chitra Ramaswamy in a four-star review.",
      "\"Sorry, team Liz, but she was the best character in Motherland: the ideal [writer] Sharon-Horgan-sharpened instrument for impaling the worst excesses, blind spots and hypocrisies of the posh, white, west London middle classes.\"",
      "She added: \"There's lots to love... When the writing is this good, it fizzes with the hysterical energy of perimenopause.\"",
      "Ramaswamy singled out one line of dialogue where Amanda reflects: \"I'm actually glad I took the kids out of private school. They've got way more chance of getting into Oxbridge from a bog-standard state.\"",
      "'Ab Fab levels of relish'",
      "The \"narcissism-powered dynamic\" between Amanda and her increasingly good-hearted mother, Felicity, is, the critic noted, \"played with Ab Fab levels of relish by Joanna Lumley\".",
      "The long-suffering Anne (Philippa Dunne) also returns for the spin-off, and there are new characters, such as Amanda's downstairs neighbour Mal (Samuel Anderson), celebrity chef Della Fry (Derry Girls actress Siobhan McSweeney) and her uber liberal wife Fi (Rochenda Sandall).",

      "For its follow-up, the Independent's Charlotte O'Sullivan noted: \"Arguably, lessons have been learnt.",

      "In her four-star review, O'Sullivan said the story of \"Punch's posh alpha mum, is clever, jolly and hard to resist\".",
      "\"Even in Motherland, Amanda had angst,\" she said. \"In the new show, as you'd expect, there's more time to explore her loneliness and self-doubt. What is Amanda good for? The answer is frequently absolutely nothing. But we root for this absurd and vulnerable woman all the same.\"",
      "\"Richard Curtis [the Notting Hill and Love Actually director] minimised the realities of gentrification to an outrageous degree,\" she continued. \"Amandaland, by contrast, seems deliberately designed to get us talking about what happens to a deprived area when the middle classes move in.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Anita Singh awarded the series five stars, labelling it as \"a treat\" from both the writers and its stars.",
      "She added that Punch \"excels at physical comedy and is hilarious as she tries to style out her reduced circumstances\".",
      "\"The script is deft and the writers nail the various stages of parenting teenagers: helping them through first love, carting them home in disgrace when they've got drunk and thrown up on themselves, and realising that you can't help them with their maths homework any more because you don't understand it.\"",
      "'A modern Mrs Bucket'",
      "The Times' Carol Midgley noted how Spin-off series \"can easily disappoint, as Joey, a feeble offshoot of Friends, showed.",
      "\"But I just knew that Amandaland, offspring of the mighty Motherland, would be glorious... and it is.\"",
      "She compared the \"deliciously desperate\" new show, and its leading woman, to being like \"a Hyacinth Bucket for 2025\".",
      "\"Keeping Up Appearances was so joyous because it mocked the absurdity of prideful status-seeking,\" she noted of the Patricia Routledge-starring 1990s BBC sitcom.",
      "\"Amanda is Hyacinth for the new age (imagine if Hyacinth had had social media!).\"",
      "\"Punch carries most of the heavy lifting with ease,\" she wrote, \"and the result is not only a spin-off that punches above its weight: it is lovely, life-affirming escapism.\"",
      "There was another five-star rating from Christopher Stevens in the Daily Mail.",
      "\"Amanda's an awful woman, of course,\" he said, \"a backstabbing snob who treats her children as accessories and turns every encounter with her 'mum chums' at the school gates into a blood sport.\"",
      "He also praised Dame Joanna, saying she \"gathers up the laughs and sweeps them into her handbag like an aristocratic shoplifter on a spree\".",
      "Tilly Pearce of the Radio Times awarded four stars, writing: \"Spin-off shows can often be a bit of a tricky tightrope. To be successful, they need to find balance with the old and new, which is kind of apt, given Amanda's situation.",

      "Non-cancerous brain tumours are more common in people over the age of 50, and symptoms can include headaches, vision problems and drowsiness, according to the NHS website.",
      "Some can be difficult to remove without damaging surrounding tissue. And Chemotherapy or radiotherapy can also be used if the surgery is not successful.",

      "Best known as the founder of the record label Murder Inc., his signature style of blending hip-hop beats with smooth R&B melodies shaped the sound of the charts in the late 90s and early 2000s.",
      "As a writer and producer, his multi-platinum hits included the J-Lo and Ja Rule duets Ain't It Funny and I'm Real, the Ashanti tracks Foolish and Always on Time, and Fat Joe's What's Luv?.",
      "\"People get confused because it sells like pop music,\" he told the Guardian in 2002. \"But we make black music first and foremost, and all our records is 'hood first'.\"",
      "A cause of death has not been announced, but the music mogul had battled diabetes-related issues and suffered what was described as a \"minor stroke\" in early 2024.",
      "At the time, Gotti's representatives said he had changed his diet and had been \"successful in making a full recovery\".",
      "Born Irving Lorenzo in Hollis, Queens, in 1971, his career began as a producer for New York MC Mic Geronimo, under the moniker DJ Irv.",
      "His big break came when he contributed to Jay-Z's debut album, Reasonable Doubt, in 1996. The rapper christened him the \"don of hip-hop\", renaming him Irv Gotti in reference to the mafia boss John Gotti.",
      "His next move was to sign gravel-voiced rapper DMX to the legendary rap label Def Jam Records.",
      "The label was in the middle of a rough patch, losing ground to Sean Combs' flashy, aspirational Bad Boy Inc label. DMX was the antidote to Combs' style - stripped back, raw and connected to the street.",
      "With Gotti as executive producer, his debut album, It's Dark and Hell is Hot, sold four million copies in the US and spawned the hip-hop classic Ruff Ryders' Anthem.",

      "Acknowledging his success, Cohen gave Gotti his own label, which he ran with his brother Chris.",
      "They chose the name Murder Inc after watching a documentary about the 20th-century New York organised crime group of the same name - reckoning that they could put out hit records in the same way their crime syndicate had put out hits for murder.",
      "Their first signing was Ja Rule, who saw massive commercial success with hits like Holla Holla, Livin' It Up, Always On Time and the UK number one Wonderful.",
      "Gotti also discovered the singer Ashanti as a teenager, and partnered her with his rap artists for a sprinkle of melodic fairydust.",
      "As a solo act, she also had a run of top 10 hits in the early 2000s with songs like Foolish, Rock Wit U and Only U.",
      "Gotti earned a Grammy for co-producing Ashanti's eponymous debut in 2002, which won best contemporary R&B album.",
      "Murder Inc also lent credibility to Jennifer Lopez's music career, with popular remixes of I'm Real and Love Don't Cost A Thing giving her frothy pop hits an urban edge.",
      "Overall, Gotti was credited as a producer on 28 US chart hits, from artists including Mary J Blige, Fat Joe and Kanye West.",
      "His career faced a setback in the mid-2000s after the FBI raided Murder Inc's offices, as part of an investigation into alleged ties with drug kingpin Kenneth \"Supreme\" McGriff.",
      "Gotti and his brother were charged with money laundering but were later acquitted of all charges.",
      "Beef with 50 Cent",
      "The accusations also formed part of a long-standing feud between Gotti and the rap star 50 Cent.",
      "As part of their search warrant, Federal investigaters alleged that McGriff and employees of  Murder Inc had plotted to assassinate the rapper as revenge for the 2000 song Ghetto Qu'ran, which detailed McGriff's criminal past.",
      "Prior to that, one of 50 Cent's associates had allegedly robbed Ja Rule in New York, triggering a run of diss tracks and altercations between the pair, culminating in a recording studio brawl where 50 Cent was stabbed.",
      "Murder Inc rapper Black Child took credit for the attack on record, claiming it was an act of self-defence.",
      "50 Cent later downplayed the severity of the incident, but he continued to take pot shots at Gotti and Murder Inc throughout his career.",
      "'Creative soldier'",
      "After the controversies, Gotti rebranded Murder Inc as The Inc. He signed singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton and continued to release albums by Ashanti, but the label struggled to match its former glories.",
      "Last July, Gotti was sued by for sexual assault and rape by an anonymous accuser, who said she had been in a relationship with the music mogul between 2020 and 2022.",
      "Through his lawyer, Gotti categorically denied the allegations, saying they \"represent an affront to women who have truly suffered abuse\".",
      "Gotti is survived by his three children, Angie, Sonny and Jonathan Wilson; his mother, Nee Nee Lorenzo; sisters Tina and Angie; and his brother Chris Lorenzo, with whom he co-founded Murder Inc.",

      "Offensive historic tweets posted by the star of the Oscar-nominated film Emilia P\u00e9rez have led to a week of fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.",
      "Tweets published by best actress nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have been widely condemned since they came to light last week.",
      "The actress has released several statements since then, saying she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments have been taken out of context.",
      "In the days since, Hollywood has distanced itself from her posts, while Netflix appears to have refocused its campaign efforts on the film's other nominees.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n said she had been on a \"rollercoaster of emotions\" in the past week in her latest statement published on Instagram (she has currently deactivated her X account).",
      "\"What a coincidence I've been trying to send a message of hope to the world for nine months and just three days ago I casually am the worst person in the world,\" she added.",
      "The tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.",
      "Netflix has not publicly commented (BBC News approached the streamer for this article), but the company has been distancing itself from her comments in recent days.",
      "Here is how the campaign around Gasc\u00f3n has changed, following the controversy.",
      "Changing the promotional posters",
      "At this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.",
      "The movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.",
      "But the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.",
      "Previously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.",
      "But an updated FYC poster released on Monday almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.",
      "\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.",
      "The CNN interview",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has released several statements on the controversy in recent days, mostly via her social media accounts.",
      "But she has also given an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.",
      "It has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".",
      "The fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team may not have signed off on such an interview being granted.",
      "Pulling out of events",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the next week or so.",
      "These included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.",
      "However, the actress is now not expected to appear at any of them, as the turmoil continues.",
      "And that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.",
      "The publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".",
      "It remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.",
      "What happens to the 'Fab Five' Oscars format?",
      "Many film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies.",
      "This sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.",
      "For example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.",
      "Traditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.",
      "However, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.",
      "Despite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy.",
      "Instead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.",
      "How could this impact Gasc\u00f3n's co-stars",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.",
      "It has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "It was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.",
      "After Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.",
      "\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"",
      "Then, on Sunday, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".",
      "Oscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.",
      "Meanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".",
      "\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.",
      "\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust.",
      "\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"",
      "As for Emilia P\u00e9rez as a whole, the controversy could make its chances of a best picture win far less likely, particularly in a year where there is no breakout frontrunner for best picture.",

      "Nearly three decades on, his legacy is in ruins as he sits in jail awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering alongside battling dozens of lawsuits accusing him of drugging and assault at lavish parties, high-end hotels and in his label's recording studio. He denies all the allegations.",
      "Now the BBC has spoken to more than 20 people who worked with Combs at Bad Boy Records - including former executives, assistants and producers - who describe for the first time troubling incidents they say they witnessed during its 1990s rise.",
      "Some executives say they had concerns after seeing Combs having sex with women in the studio, including one incident where the employee says the young woman did not seem to react when he walked in. Another staff member complained Combs asked her to bring him condoms.",
      "The BBC also heard that corporate funds were used to fly in women from across the US for sex at the request of artists and other employees.",
      "\"There was a course of conduct that became more egregious over time and that conduct does go back to the 90s,\" says Tony Buzbee, a US lawyer representing dozens of alleged victims, including one who says Combs threatened to kill her in similar terms to the incident Evans says he witnessed.",
      "His client alleges Combs raped her on a bathroom floor at a promotional party held for The Notorious B.I.G., the label's biggest star, in 1995. She says in her lawsuit that afterwards, Combs told her not to tell anyone or \"you will disappear\".",
      "In a statement, Combs's legal team accused Buzbee of being \"more interested in media attention than the truth\" and said the hip-hop star \"never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone\".",
      "The 55-year-old's lawyers said they had not been provided with sufficient details about the BBC's claims to present the facts that would \"counter these fabricated accusations\".",
      "\"As we've said before, Mr Combs cannot dignify every publicity stunt or facially absurd claim with a response. He has full confidence in the judicial process, where the truth will prevail: these accusations are pure fiction,\" they said.",
      "A brash go-getter, Sean Combs became an overnight millionaire when he launched Bad Boy Records in 1993 with a roster of top artists.",
      "It was Combs's first venture, having already built a name for himself as a talent director at another music label, Uptown Records, aged 19.",
      "\"He said that he wanted to be one of the biggest artists in the world and it didn't matter if I believed him or not,\" remembers Jimmy Maynes, a former Uptown colleague.",
      "Maynes remembers Combs having a short fuse in the office, sometimes banging \"his hands up against the desk\" like a \"bratty kid\" and yelling if he did not get his way.",
      "Combs was eventually fired from Uptown and at the age of 23 started Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"He's the hardest working man that I've ever met and always wanted people to match his energy,\" says Daniel Evans, a senior executive who managed Bad Boy's recording budgets and artists' contracts between 1994 and 1997.",
      "Combs described himself as the \"Great Gatsby\" and swiftly became known for hosting coveted celebrity bashes at New York nightclubs, on the beaches of Cancun, Mexico, and later infamous \"White Parties\" - named after the all-white dress code - in the Hamptons.",
      "Even President Donald Trump attended events in the 90s, says Evans, who once saw him sit on a golden throne at Combs's 30th birthday and exclaim: \"I'm the real King of New York!\"",
      "\"We were all really young. I was 24 years old,\" reflects Evans, who was one of the label's original employees. \"People wanted to party, have fun, hook up and build good memories.\"",
      "But looking back, Evans says he is troubled by some of the things he witnessed about his boss's behaviour and the company culture.",
      "In about 1995, he says he walked in on Combs having sex with a young woman at Daddy's House, Bad Boy's New York recording studio near Times Square.",
      "\"I was getting ready to go home for the night and looking for my jacket. Open the door and he's having sex with this girl,\" says Evans, who thought the studio was empty as it was silent. Combs swore and shouted at him to leave. \"I thought I was getting fired,\" he says.",
      "Evans remembers the young woman had been brought to the studio, presumably for a tour, by a party-promoter who was a friend of Combs. His boss seemed sober, while she was quiet and did not really talk, he says, wondering if she was high on drugs or just shy.",
      "He says it did not seem unusual at the time. But recalling how the woman did not react when he entered the room, he says: \"Knowing what I know now, there's a lot of speculation about what state she was in\u2026 usually both parties are very responsive during the act.\"",
      "Felicia Newsome, the manager of Daddy's House recording studio between 1994 and 2000, says inappropriate conduct in the music industry as a whole was rife at the time.",
      "\"It was abnormal if somebody reported it, but it wasn't abnormal for it to be happening,\" she says.",
      "Newsome says an employee once called her to the studio in the middle of the night because Combs was in his underwear, about to have sex with a model and another woman. He was demanding the staff member fetch him condoms, she recalls.",
      "\"I said to Puffy, don't ever ask anyone here to go and get condoms,\" says Newsome, who arrived while they were getting dressed again. \"He replied: 'I didn't need anything like that, ma,' and never did it again.\"",
      "Newsome, then in her 30s, says she found Combs reasonable and that he changed his behaviour when she challenged him. On one occasion, when the studio first opened in 1995, she says Combs was unhappy about the look of the countertops and called her a \"bitch\" in front of staff.",

      "She says she demanded a public apology and temporarily shut the studio, asking him: \"If I'm bringing women into this space, which is open 24 hours, how do you want to treat people?\"",
      "Combs responded that he wanted it to be an inclusive and safe environment, she says.",
      "But while Newsome ran the studio with an \"iron fist\", she says other staff were less comfortable calling Combs out.",
      "\"Bad Boy Records was a crazy house with a lot of young people who wanted to touch the King's robes,\" she says.",
      "Former staff say the label was run by twenty-something executives and a large number of interns, some of whom were of school age. There were often sexual relationships between employees and the interns, they say.",
      "Evans remembers an uncomfortable moment with a 14-year-old in his own team, who he says propositioned him.",
      "\"She says to me, you work really hard. If you ever want to like, get loose, you and I should kick it\u2026 but not tonight, I have a curfew.\"",
      "Evans says he sent her home and called the next day, telling her not to return to work. He did not report her, but two weeks later she was back working in the mailroom.",
      "Artists and other employees at Combs's record label would sometimes also request for women to be flown in to have sex at the studio, the former executive says.",
      "\"If they had a [sexual] specialty in something, they would be flown in,\" says Evans, who told the BBC he knew because he controlled the budgets. Money for the flights would be set aside and logged under travel, he adds.",
      "\"It was probably like thousands of dollars,\" says Evans. \"I don't think it happened all that often, but it was definitely a recording expense.\"",
      "Evans says Combs's own requests were managed by his personal assistants. One told the BBC that Combs would often ask them to fly in women he was \"messing around with\" and put them up in hotels, though the assistant said they were not sex workers.",
      "In the 2000s, the Daddy's House recording studio further changed, two former staff say, into a culture of \"sex, drugs and rock'n'roll\". Combs would regularly bring \"random women\" there to party, turning up with an entourage of dozens of people in \"three white jeeps, with white rims and white leather seats\", they say. Other artists would demand suitcases of Ciroc vodka and one even brought a monkey to a session, according to a former executive.",
      "The studio is one of the locations where women have since accused Combs of drugging and raping them. Model Crystal McKinney alleges the mogul plied her with alcohol and marijuana before sexually assaulting her there in 2003. That same year, a woman alleges that Combs and two associates gang raped her at the studio when she was 17.",
      "Combs's lawyers say he \"looks forward to proving his innocence\", adding that McKinney's claims are \"without merit\".",
      "Many ex-staff say they still find it hard to reconcile the allegations with the man they knew. \"These accusations are a surprise to me, as I am sure it is to many of our circle,\" says Jeffery Walker, a close friend of Combs who was part of Bad Boy's original production team. \"I've been to White Parties and of course studio sessions, and none of what he is accused of went down in my sight.\"",
      "Evans was also sceptical about some of the claims until he saw the footage of Casandra Ventura, Combs's ex-partner of 10 years and a former Bad Boy artist, being brutally beaten by the rapper in a hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Ventura was the first person to sue Combs back in November 2023, alleging that he had trapped her in a cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking during their relationship. Combs settled the lawsuit the next day for an undisclosed amount.",
      "\"It's not the first time I've seen that temper,\" recalls Evans, thinking back to the death threat he says he witnessed back in 1997. \"It's hard to see. The guy in the video with Cassie is almost identical to the guy who threatened the employee. So, you wonder, has anything changed?\"",
      "Over the years, Sean Combs has repeatedly reinvented himself - from Puff Daddy, to P Diddy and in recent years, \"Love\".",
      "\"If I'm acting crazy, like 'ahhh!' that's Diddy. If I'm dancing real smooth with a girl, that's Puff Daddy. And if I'm looking like I'm nervous or scared or shy, that's Sean,\" he said in an interview in 2015.",
      "With more details likely to emerge when he goes on trial in May, many of those who were close to the rapper are questioning whether they knew the real Sean Combs at all.",
      "\"One could think that he's just a disgusting human being, but that's not my memory of Puff,\" says Jimmy Maynes, who grew up with Combs in Mount Vernon, New York.",
      "But after a pause, he adds: \"Or maybe money just gives people the freedom to be exactly who they really are, and he was that guy all along.\"",

    "story": [
      "In many ways Anora feels like a fairy tale. Except that the film's title character - Ani to her friends - is a stripper and occasional sex worker. And her Prince Charming is the spoiled son of a Russian oligarch.",

      "\"I think that she's hopeful that this is her happily ever after, and I think that it's an opportunity and I like that she doesn't want to let go of them. And so she's going to fight to the end to try to save it.\"",

      "\"I have been working for almost a decade now, well trying to work. And that was my ultimate dream, to go to Cannes. And we had a film in the main competition, and then we won [the top prize, the Palme D'Or] and that was crazy in itself.\"",

      "\"As an actor sometimes I felt like I was shooting a very romantic film, and sometimes it was almost like a horror film, or a drama, or a slapstick comedy. To navigate through my character with all of these different genres was fun. It was a challenge, and I liked it!\"",

      "\"Cancelling, pushing, moving does not accomplish what us standing together\" does, Mr Mason argued in a webcast before the show.

      "So it was something of a coup when he gave an unannounced, unexpected performance in the middle of Sunday's ceremony.",
      "He was introduced by the Recording Academy's CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, who acknowledged the star's criticisms, and described his efforts to revamp the Grammys' electorate, by boosting the number of women and people of colour.",
      "After that, the star took to the stage with two songs from his brand new album, Cry For Me and Timeless.",
      "It was meant to be a celebration of people's ability to learn and grow, but the music was so oppressively drab \u2013 with the Weeknd constantly shrouded in smoke and shadow -  that you wondered whether he'd simply returned to sabotage the Grammys from within.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Chappell Roan rides a big pink pony",
      "BBC Sound of 2025 winner Chappell Roan cantered into the Grammys with a theatrical performance of Pink Pony Club - her love letter to LA, as well as a celebration of queer discovery.",
      "Backed by dancers dressed as rodeo clowns, Roan - herself wearing a sequinned cowboy hat and sparkly boots - rode a a giant pink carousel pony, complete with an 80s perm.",
      "\"'My Little Pony' grew up!\" joked host Trevor Noah afterwards.",
      "The performance was part of a segment that raised awareness and funds for wildfire relief.",
      "Roan, real name Kayleigh Amstutz, later received a standing ovation for using her best new artist winning speech to call on record labels to provide up-and-coming artists with liveable wages and healthcare.",
      "Quite a night for the 26-year-old, who might be feeling a little horse in the morning.",
      "LOWLIGHT: Kanye West and Bianca Censori's nude stunt",
      "Rapper Kanye West arrived on the red carpet dressed in black with his wife Bianca Censori, who was, to all intents and purposes, naked.",
      "As the couple stopped to pose for cameras, the Australian model removed her black fur coat to reveal a sheer body stocking that left little to the imagination.",
      "The pair then made a swift exit, electing to skip the ceremony, driving off into the LA night.",
      "Early reports suggested they had been kicked out, but the BBC understands they left of their own accord, with one source saying that West, \"walked the carpet, got in his car and left\".",
      "They may well have been home by the time West's track Carnival lost out to Kendrick Lamar in the best rap song category.",
      "But he probably won't mind: He already has 24 Grammy awards, and now he has the headlines he craves, too.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Brat Green picks up a prize",
      "Among the three awards Charli XCX picked up was one of the night's most obscure: Best artwork.",
      "At first glance, that might seem odd. The album cover is a plain green square, with the word \"brat\" printed in a deliberately low-resolution Arial font.",
      "But the cover took five months to put together, with designer Brent David Freaney testing around 500 shades of green to produce a garish, nausea-inducing effect.",
      "Charli wanted the artwork to be deliberately off-putting \u2013 reflecting the album's dual themes of partying and self doubt. And she said it was important to challenge the convention of women dressing provocatively to promote their music.",
      "\"Why should anyone have that level of ownership over female artists?\" she asked Vogue magazine.",
      "She added: \"I wanted to go with an offensive, off-trend shade of green to trigger the idea of something being wrong. I'd like for us to question our expectations of pop culture - why are some things considered good and acceptable, and some things deemed bad?",
      "\"I'm interested in the narratives behind that and I want to provoke people. I'm not doing things to be nice.\"",
      "Towards the end of the ceremony, the star's live performance of Von Dutch and Guess saw her transform the biggest and glitziest night in music into a packed and sweaty nightclub.",
      "Emerging from a black SUV, she strutted towards the camera, throwing a glass of champagne against the wall of a parking garage, before launching into what appeared to be an underground rave.",
      "As the performance progressed, she appeared on stage with model Julia Fox and hundreds of dancers, who were then showered in underwear (a reference to the song's lyrics).",
      "The Grammys said all of the unworn garments were donated to domestic violence survivors after the show.",
      "Highlight: This photo (1)",
      "I can't be the only person desperate to know what Taylor is whispering, right?",
      "HIGHLIGHT: This photo (2)",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's stunned reaction to winning best country album is a gif that will never stop gif-ing.",
      "LOWLIGHT (if you\u2019re Drake): Kendrick Lamar\u2019s clean sweep",
      "The Grammys have a wobbly history with hip-hop. They didn't introduce a rap category until 1989, a full decade after the Sugarhill Gang introduced the genre to a wide audience with Rapper's Delight. And no rap act has won album of the year since OutKast in 2001.",
      "So it was a rare victory when Compton-born rapper Kendrick Lamar won all five of the awards in which he was nominated for Not Like Us, a furious takedown of his musical rival, Drake.",
      "Among those awards were the prestigious record and song of the year - categories that have only ever recognised a rap song once before (Childish Gambino's This Is America in 2019).",
      "Lamar didn't perform at the ceremony - he plays the Super Bowl halftime show next week instead - but, dressed head to toe in denim, he delivered a powerful message to Grammy voters.",
      "\"At the end of the day, nothing is more powerful than rap music. I don't care what it is. We are the culture\u2026 respect the art form\".",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Janelle Mona\u00e9's moonwalk moment",
      "Music lost one of its biggest legends in 2024, when Quincy Jones died at the age of 91.",
      "As the producer for everyone from Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson, the Grammys gave him a star-studded send-off that lasted almost 20 minutes.",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Herbie Hancock played a beautiful version of Fly Me To The Moon; while Stevie Wonder's sang We Are The World with choirs from two schools affected by the devastating LA fires.",
      "But it was Janelle Mona\u00e9's performance of Michael Jackson's Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough that blew the roof off.",
      "Dressed in MJ's Billie Jean outfit, she pirouetted and moonwalked and jumped on the tables as if she'd been possessed by the man himself.",
      "Towards the end of the performance, she threw off her jacket to reveal a t-shirt bearing the legend \"I Love QJ\".",
      "And guess who caught it and wore it for the rest of the night?",
      "Taylor Swift.",
      "LOWLIGHT: Snubs for Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift",
      "Even with 94 awards to consider, some people will get overlooked - but nobody expected two of the Grammys' biggest darlings to go home empty-handed.",
      "Taylor Swift was blanked despite scoring six nominations. Voters clearly decided that The Tortured Poets Department wasn't worthy of comparison with her four previous album of the year winners (Fearless, 1989, Folklore and Midnights).",
      "Billie Eilish's wipeout was even more unexpected. She had been the bookmakers' favourite for album of the year, for her third release Hit Me Hard And Soft - but she lost all seven of the categories she was nominated for.",
      "Still, there was a lot of competition this year, especially in the pop categories. And Swift has spoken in the past about how losing album of the year for Red inspired her pop opus, and biggest-seller to date, 1989.",
      "Don't count either of these artists out just yet.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Trevor Noah's easy-going hosting",
      "There's a reason they keep inviting Trevor Noah back to host the Grammys: He's got the tone right.",
      "He's relaxed, he's engaged with the music, and his humour never punches down.",
      "Here are some of his best quips from the night:",
      "\"Yesterday, Beyonce announced her new tour. Everyone saw that. I will say, though, Beyonce, there's tariffs. We can't afford a new tour, right? Maple syrup is about to be $50.\"\"Taylor Swift could become the first artist ever to win album of the year five times. Which means she would break the record of four wins, set all the way back in 2024 by Taylor Swift. I'm just gonna say Taylor, if you break Taylor's record, the Swifties are gonna come for you. And you don't wanna mess with them.\"\"The Beatles are nominated tonight for Record of the Year. Yes, the legendary band from Liverpool used AI to put out a new song after 53 years. So good luck to the Beatles. I think if they win, this could open up a few doors for them.\"\"And who knows, through the power of AI, one day, we could even get another Rihanna album.\"",

      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",

      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",

      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

      "Nearly 13,800 patients were in hospital even though medically fit to be discharged \u2013 a record high this winter.",
      "NHS England emergency-care director Prof Julian Redhead said: \"The twin pressures of winter viruses and problems discharging patients means hospitals are close to full \u2013 even as more beds have been opened to manage the increased demand.",
      "\"While pressures on hospitals remains incredibly high, it's vital people continue to use NHS services in the normal way \u2013 using 111 and 111 online if you need advice and support for health conditions, and only using 999 or attending A&E in life-threatening emergencies.\"",

      "A review into the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) found while prosecutors had been right to accept Calocane's pleas of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility, they could have handled the case better.",
      "And in May, a judge ruled Calocane's sentence was not unduly lenient.",

      "\"It's very rare that you can say to someone 'I know how dreadful that is' and know that that person really does know,\" she said.",

      "The report states the former University of Nottingham student first came into contact with mental health services on 24 May 2020, when he was 28, when he was arrested for criminal damage to a neighbour's flat.",
      "It was documented that Calocane's behaviour was an episode of psychosis brought on by the stress of course work and a forthcoming exam, coupled with a lack of sleep.",
      "Shortly after returning to his home, Calocane again tried to gain access to a neighbour's flat. His neighbour was so frightened that she jumped from a first-floor window, sustaining back injuries which required surgery.",
      "Calocane was then detained for the first time under section 2 of the Mental Health Act, which meant he could be kept in hospital against his will for up to 28 days - known as a \"section\".",

      "After about a month in hospital, Calocane was sent home with reviews expected from the community crisis team and the early intervention in psychosis (EIP) service.",
      "He was initially called by the crisis team. The contact was a phone call rather than a face-to-face appointment \"because of Covid-19 restrictions at the time\".",
      "His family expressed concerns because they felt he could \"play down his symptoms\" over the phone.",
      "In July 2020, Calocane was admitted to hospital for a second time after forcibly entering a neighbour's flat.",
      "He was sectioned again, this time under section 3 of the Mental Health Act, which allows for a longer hospital stay of up to six months.",
      "According to medical records shared by Calocane's family with BBC Panorama, while Calocane was ill in hospital, a psychiatrist observed that \"there seems to be no insight or remorse and the danger is that this will happen again and perhaps Valdo will end up killing someone\".",

      "According to the report, his family \"felt this was a real missed opportunity to fully understand [Calocane's] diagnosis, risk and to get to grips with a treatment plan that [Calocane] was concordant with\".",
      "Three months before his third hospital admission in August 2021, Calocane's family again reported concerns over his mental health.",
      "At the end of August, his care co-ordinator visited him at home with a colleague, noting that he was no longer taking his medication and had no intention of continuing treatment.",
      "A month later, the report said he had \"significantly assaulted\" police officers who attended in support of a Mental Health Act assessment.",
      "On a number of occasions, his care co-ordinator had suggested the use of depot medication - which releases slowly over time meaning patients need to administer medications less frequently.",
      "But, the report said, the inpatient teams were trying to treat him \"in the least restrictive way\", and took on board his reasons for not wanting to take injectable depot medication, \"which included him not liking needles\".",
      "After multiple missed appointments, in January 2022, officials contemplated discharging Calocane from the EIP service due to a lack of engagement.",
      "But the following day, the EIP learned Calocane had trapped two housemates in their flat, which resulted in the police being called.",

      "A self-styled \"beauty consultant\", whose celebrity client list includes Katie Price, is offering potentially dangerous cosmetic procedures to clients and handing over medication illegally - a BBC investigation has discovered.",
      "Ricky Sawyer specialises in liquid Brazilian butt-lifts (BBLs) - which involves injecting dermal filler into buttocks to lift them and make them look bigger.",
      "BBC News has spoken to five of his clients who needed emergency hospital treatment after their procedures. We have also been shown the testimonies of more than 30 women who say they have been left with serious complications such as sepsis and necrosis (tissue death).",
      "One woman told us she felt at the time she would rather \"have died\" than continue with the pain she was in following the treatment.",
      "Several local authorities have banned Mr Sawyer from practising in their areas.",
      "Our undercover filming captured Mr Sawyer handing out antibiotics without a valid prescription - a criminal offence. He is not qualified to prescribe and the pills were not labelled for a specific patient.",
      "He also offered to inject increasing doses of local anaesthetic without a prescriber present - again illegal - and did not ask for our reporter's weight, thus putting her at risk of an overdose.",
      "Posing as a potential client and her friend, we had booked a 45-minute appointment with Mr Sawyer through his Instagram page. We told him we wanted a 200ml (7fl oz) liquid BBL injection costing \u00a31,200. We paid a \u00a3200 deposit.",
      "Despite having advertised that all liquid BBLs would be carried out under the guidance of an \"ultrasound specialist doctor\", none was present at his pop-up clinic. He was working out of a small room in an east London office block - a non-clinical environment which would have increased the risk of infection.",
      "Within five minutes of being in his office, Mr Sawyer had begun to encourage our reporter to think about increasing the amount of filler. \"You might be surprised about how much product you can have and still look natural,\" he suggested.",
      "By the end of the appointment, Mr Sawyer had offered to inject a litre of filler - 500ml (almost a pint) per buttock - at a cost of \u00a32,000.",
      "We did not go through with it and later returned to put our allegations to him - but he refused to answer our questions and slammed the door on our reporter.",
      "Reviewing our footage, plastic surgeon Dalvi Humzah, who sits on the Joint Council of Cosmetic Practitioners, said Mr Sawyer's actions were \"shocking\", \"very dangerous\", and putting patients at a huge risk of infection and potentially fatal complications.",
      "\"Putting that volume in, in one sitting, is really dangerous,\" said Mr Humzah. \"The buttocks are such a large area that if they become infected it can overwhelm the body and could end in sepsis - or even death.\"",
      "The filler used for liquid BBLs is often made up of hyaluronic acid, which is commonly used in facial filling treatments. Because large amounts of the acid are involved in BBLs, and there is a risk of serious side effects such as blood clots and sepsis, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous cosmetic procedures.",
      "Mr Sawyer boasted on camera that he did up to seven procedures a day, six days a week. He can charge thousands of pounds per appointment.",
      "One of the women who said she had experienced serious complications after receiving a liquid BBL from Mr Sawyer was Joanne. A mum of two from south Wales, who only wants us to use her first name, she travelled seven hours to Essex for the treatment.",
      "Having had other cosmetic treatments before and having been persuaded by Ricky Sawyer's many adverts and celebrity endorsements, a liquid BBL didn't seem like such a big step to her.",
      "All she wanted, she says, was a \"peachy bum\".",
      "But when Joanne arrived, she began to have second thoughts.",
      "She had only been sent a postcode and says she seemed to be walking into an industrial estate.",
      "In the end, she found a small door into a block of flats and says she was told to wait in a \"dingy little hallway\" for about half an hour.",
      "\"I should have turned and ran,\" she says, \"but I had paid \u00a3600 deposit and travelled all this way.\"",
      "She was taken into a small room where there \"was only a bed, a tiny stool and a worktop\", and that is where she says she first met Ricky Sawyer.",
      "After counting out the rest of her cash - \u00a32,000 in total - she says he told her to stand in front of him while he sat on the stool.",
      "As he started to inject her with a litre (1.8 pints) of filler, the pain quickly became unbearable.",
      "\"I felt dizzy, sick and like shaky. My legs didn't even move properly. And that was all within a minute of him starting,\" she says. \"I remember looking round and he had white gloves on that were full of blood.\"",
      "By the end of the procedure, Joanne was in agony: \"I was in so much pain, my bottom was completely disfigured.\"",
      "She says she could barely sit down. By the time she got home the swelling had started and she could hardly walk.",
      "\"I messaged Ricky loads of times to say how bad I was feeling and how worried I was. He just told me to take my antibiotics.\"",
      "By this point, sepsis had begun to set in.",
      "\"My temperature kept on going up and I felt terrible,\" says Joanne. \"I had to phone 999. I was dripping with sweat and screaming.\"",
      "In hospital, she was attached to intravenous antibiotics. At one point, a surgeon drew on her buttock to indicate where they might need to cut, because the infection was spreading so quickly.",
      "After messaging Ricky Sawyer saying she was in hospital with sepsis, she says he blocked her from his Instagram account.",
      "Fortunately, Joanne did not need an operation.",
      "Another of Mr Sawyer's clients, Louise Moller, did need life-saving emergency surgery.",
      "Four days after receiving a liquid BBL at his Essex clinic in October 2023, the 28-year-old from Bolton was in hospital.",
      "She rang her mother, Janet, from Salford Royal's A&E department saying: \"Mum, I think I'm going to die.\"",
      "Louise had contracted sepsis and was warned by surgeons that she could die at any minute. To stop the infection from moving through her body, they cut dead tissue out of an area almost covering her entire left buttock.",
      "Janet promised her daughter she would prevent this from happening to anyone else and reported Ricky Sawyer to their local police station in Bolton.",
      "\"How can he carry on knowing he could kill someone?\" she told the BBC.",
      "However, Louise's case highlights the difficulty in holding practitioners like him accountable.",
      "Janet says she was told by police in Bolton that the file would need to be passed to Essex Police, where the incident happened.",
      "A prosecution could be difficult however, she was warned, because Louise had signed a consent form.",
      "BBC News has approached both Greater Manchester Police and Essex Police to get an update on the case - both have said it is down to the other to investigate.",
      "From a legal point of view, there is little to stop Mr Sawyer from practising.",
      "Injecting dermal fillers is seen as non-surgical and is unregulated, which means anyone can do it - and they can't be struck off and stopped.",
      "In September 2024, Alice Webb is believed to have become the first person to die after receiving a liquid BBL in the UK. Her procedure was not carried out by Ricky Sawyer.",
      "Following her death, Save Face - a group that campaigns for greater regulation to cover non-surgical procedures - called for a new law banning liquid BBLs from being carried out by anyone other than surgeons registered with the General Medical Council (GMC).",
      "Save Face's founder, Ashton Collins, says her organisation has received complaints from 39 women about Ricky Sawyer.",
      "All the women, she says, have told her they have been left needing urgent hospital treatment. Each of them, she says, had a BBL and suffered complications such as sepsis, necrosis and disfigurement.",
      "\"We've encouraged these women to report their experiences to the police,\" she says. \"Some have, and nothing has been done.\"",
      "So far, the most effective action has been taken by local authorities, three of which - Glasgow City Council, Epping Forest District Council and Brentwood Council -  confirmed they had issued prohibition notices under Health and Safety law to protect the public from serious injury.",
      "But \"he just moves on to different areas of the country and carries on\", says Ms Collins.",
      "We put our evidence to the Department of Health and Social Care which said it was \"urgently looking at options for tougher regulation\".",
      "It said our findings were \"shocking\" and that those caught \"dispensing medication without a licence should feel the full force of the law\".",
      "We attempted to put our allegations to Ricky Sawyer in person, by confronting him at his east London clinic.",
      "As soon as he saw the camera he tried to slam the door on us, before hiding behind it.",
      "We asked him if he was breaking the law by handing out prescription-only medicine, and if he had anything to say to the women who say they were left with such serious injuries that they needed emergency care.",
      "\"No,\" he said - and told us to leave.",
      "The dangers of unregulated cosmetic surgery should be taken far more seriously, says Ashton Collins.",

      "The lengthy and medically technical press conference was organised by Letby's legal team who had said the panel would present \"significant new medical evidence\".",
      "Dr Lee, a Canadian neonatal care expert, said there were alternative explanations for each of Letby's convictions for murder or attempted murder.",
      "He said he became involved in the case after learning that an academic paper he co-authored on air embolism, one of the methods Letby was said to have used to attack babies, had formed part of the prosecution case in her trial.",
      "Dr Lee said the 14 experts, including medical professionals from Canada, the US, Japan, Germany, Sweden and the UK, had looked at 17 cases at the heart of Letby's prosecution and had compiled an \"impartial evidence-based report\".",
      "The report presented at the conference was a summary of the panel's findings, and the full report would be submitted to Letby's legal team, Dr Lee said.",
      "Dr Lee provided what he said were highly detailed grounds baby-by-baby for concluding that none of the murders occurred.",
      "He added: \"We did not find any murders. In all cases, death or injury were due to natural causes or just bad medical care.\"",
      "\"Lucy was charged with seven murders and seven attempted murders\", he said.",

      "During Letby's trial, the prosecution referred to the 1989 paper by Dr Lee that looked at cases of air embolus, referring to injuries caused when air is injected into a baby's arteries or veins after staff at the Countess of Chester reported skin discoloration on some of the babies.",
      "In the cases Dr Lee analysed in his paper, those injuries had happened accidentally.",
      "The prosecution argued that one of the methods Letby used to injure or kill babies was to inject air into their veins and used Dr Lee's paper to back that claim.",
      "In the paper, Dr Lee described a distinct discoloration on the babies' skin in 10% of cases.",

      "Dr Lee said he had recently updated his academic paper and found no cases of skin discolouration linked to air embolism by the venous system.",
      "He prefaced his remarks by saying that the thoughts of each panel member were with the families of the babies who had died.",
      "Former neonatal nurse Letby, now 35, lost two bids to challenge her convictions at the Court of Appeal last year.",
      "The prosecution's medical case was scrutinised by the Court of Appeal in May last year and found to be safe - and the judges noted Letby herself did not present any experts at her trial offering an alternative view.",
      "Dr Lee had offered to give evidence to the Court of Appeal as part of Letby's application for permission to appeal, but three senior judges said his conclusions did not undermine her convictions.",
      "The judges concluded there had been no prosecution expert evidence diagnosing air embolus solely on the basis of skin discolouration.",
      "Earlier, the CCRC said Letby's lawyers had applied to the commission to investigate her case as a potential miscarriage of justice.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:21:20 GMT",
    "summary": "The gene therapy Casgevy, which will now be offered to some patients in England, could help people live disease-free, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "A gene-editing therapy for sickle cell disease, with a price tag of \u00a31.65m, is to be offered to patients on the NHS in England.",
      "About 50 people a year with the inherited blood disorder are likely to receive it, experts say.",
      "Prof Bola Owolabi, of NHS England, called it a \"monumental step forward\", and said the one-off treatment Casgevy, also known as Exa-cel, \"holds a very real prospect of  a cure\".",
      "A confidential agreement has been made with manufacturer Vertex on how much the NHS will pay.",
      "Campaigners have described the treatment as \"groundbreaking\" and its availability on the NHS as a \"milestone\".",
      "Sickle cell disease can be life-threatening and cause recurring intense pain, when blood vessels become blocked by misshapen red cells.",
      "About 15,000 people in England live with the condition, which mainly affects people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage.",
      "It is caused by genetic change that means people make haemoglobin - a key protein in red blood cells - that doesn't work properly.",
      "This results in red blood cells becoming sickle in shape and stiff and sticky - rather than flexible smooth discs.",
      "These sickle cells do not live as long as healthy red blood cells and can clump as they travel around blood vessels - reducing oxygen to vital parts of the body.",
      "This puts people at risk of organ damage, stroke, heart failure and a greatly  reduced quality of life.",
      "In trials all patients who received the therapy - which tweaks a specific gene and allows the body to make more healthy red blood cells - avoided stays in hospital for a year after treatment and most for three-and-a-half years. Further data is still being studied.",
      "NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the therapy \"could be absolutely transformative \u2013 it could enable patients to live free from the fear of sickle cell crises hanging over them\".",
      "Asiawu Imam, 26, lives in London, where she works as a nurse looking after people who have sickle cell disorder. She also lives with the condition.",
      "When she was younger she was in and out of hospital three to four times a year with painful sickle cell crises.",
      "\"It feels like a stabbing pain, like someone is stabbing you form the inside outwards. It can last anything from half an hour to four days. It is excruciating,\" she said.",
      "The therapy being made available on the NHS gives her hope, and a sense to the community that people with the condition are being taken seriously.",
      "\"This is going to be a life-changing moment for many of my patients.\"",
      "How the gene therapy works",
      "It is a multi-step process.",
      "First, blood stem cells from a patient's bone marrow (where all blood cells originate) are removed from the body.",
      "In the laboratory, a gene-editing tool called Crispr is used.",
      "This allows a specific gene to be pinpointed and very precise editing to take place.",
      "However, instead of directly editing a faulty gene, Casgevy instead takes advantage of a process that happens when babies are in the womb, where they make red blood cells with foetal haemoglobin (a key protein that carries oxygen). This switches to the adult form once they are born.",
      "Crucially foetal haemoglobin is not affected by sickle cell disease, so Crispr acts by dampening down the \"switch\" that makes the body produce the adult form.",
      "Patients have to undergo \"conditioning\" chemotherapy to make sure their bodies are ready to accept the edited stem cells.",
      "Modified stem cells are then transfused back into the body, where they multiply and increase the production of stable, well-functioning red cells.",
      "The full treatment must be considered carefully - it can involve lengthy stays in hospital and may have side effects, including headaches and bleeding problems.",
      "UK approves gene-edit drug for sickle cell disease",
      "First gene-editing therapy may cure blood disorder",
      "The only other current option for a cure is a stem cell transplant - but this can only happen if a closely matched donor is available. There is also a risk of the transplant being rejected.",
      "The gene therapy will be available in specialist centres in London, Manchester and Birmingham to people aged 12 and over who get recurrent sickle cell crises and who cannot find a donor for a stem cell transplant.",
      "John James, chief executive of the Sickle Cell Society, said: \"We are absolutely thrilled to see this groundbreaking gene therapy treatment available on the NHS\", adding \"the significance of this milestone for the sickle cell community could not be understated\".",
      "He said the news would \"give hope to many\" and was \"incredible\".",
      "However, he added: \"We remain acutely aware that not everyone with sickle cell will be eligible for the potentially life-changing benefits of Casgevy.",
      "\"There is still much work ahead to ensure that everyone living with sickle cell has access to the care, treatments, and support they deserve.\"",
      "The therapy has already been approved for another inherited blood disorder, transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.",
      "It is already being given to patients in other countries such as France, Germany and Italy.",
      "Wales is also expected to provide it in the next few months."

      "Some are on flashing video screens in places where they can easily be seen by children. The BBC has also seen adverts in Morrisons for a similar device called Ploom.",
      "Heated tobacco is different from vapes, which contain nicotine but no tobacco, and they are much less popular. But tobacco companies are keen to promote it as a new revenue stream to replace dwindling cigarette sales.",
      "The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), which represents local authority trading standards teams, says the ads are \"prohibited\" by the 2002 law.",
      "CTSI says the issue has never been tested in court, so it cannot say conclusively that running them is illegal.",
      "\"The only people who can definitively test it are the courts. Now the courts are chocka. Trading Standards is very stretched, and I think that's probably the reason why you're seeing more and more of these ads,\" Kate Pike, lead officer for tobacco and vaping at CTSI, told the BBC.",

      "In June 2018, then-health minister Steve Brine wrote to the company that makes iQos, Philip Morris International (PMI), to say advertising for it was \"prohibited\" and to ask them to \"desist from such promotion in the future\".",

      "PMI says it only agreed to suspend advertising, not stop.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"We maintain our view that communications regarding the iQos device at appropriate points of sale is lawful.\"",
      "Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which makes Ploom, said the 2002 law defines a tobacco product as something that is \"smoked, sniffed, sucked or chewed\", and because heated tobacco products do not produce smoke, they aren't covered by that definition.",
      "Morrisons cited the same argument. \"On that basis, we are comfortable that it is legal for heated tobacco products to be advertised in store,\" it said.",
      "Sainsbury's said the ads were \"in line with current tobacco legislation\".",
      "Both supermarkets say they do not sell the devices to children.",
      "PMI and JTI say their heated tobacco devices are only intended for existing nicotine and tobacco users.",
      "Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said supermarkets advertising these products was \"disgraceful behaviour\".",
      "\"[It] puts pressure on overstretched enforcement services and risks introducing children and young people to new tobacco products.\"",

      "A spokesperson said: \"This government's landmark Tobacco and Vapes Bill will enhance existing legislation, including on advertising, and put us on track for a smoke-free UK.\"",
      "The forthcoming bill is expected to ban all advertising of nicotine and tobacco products including nicotine pouches and vapes.",
      "The UK's biggest supermarket Tesco said it does not run tobacco ads, while a spokesperson for Asda said it doesn't advertise tobacco products \"in order to comply with current legislation as we understand it\"."

      "What is it like to have the test as a transgender man?",
      "Jack Latham, a 28-year-old personal trainer living in Kent, says he received his first screening invite aged 25, just after he came out as trans. He says his GP was \"incredibly supportive\" and there was even a poster in his surgery's waiting room encouraging trans men to have a cervical screening.",
      "Trans and non-binary people who have a cervix should still have regular cervical screenings.",
      "Jack says he'd put off the appointment out of fear, until he went for a blood test in summer 2024 and the nurse offered him a cervical screening on the spot.",

      "Women aged 25-49 are encouraged to have a screening every three years, while women aged 50-64 should have one every five years.",
      "NHS England data from March 2024 showed 44.5% of women aged 25-29 had not been screened in the last 3.5 years. For those aged 30-34, this figure was 35.3%.",
      "The proportion of younger women who have been adequately screened has been falling a little in recent years.",
      "Dr Sue Mann, NHS national clinical director for women's health, told the BBC in a statement that medics know that some women find screenings \"very worrying and uncomfortable\".",
      "She emphasised that adjustments are always available and that women should book their screenings, even if they were invited months or years ago.",
      "A display at the Vagina Museum in east London last year encouraged visitors to write improvements they'd like to see to the NHS's cervical screening service on slips of paper.",

      "Jessica thinks doctors should explain the results using plainer language, and says she had to call her GP for further explanation after receiving her results letter.",
      "Would you rather do the test yourself?",
      "Some people prefer to carry out medical tests in the comfort of their own homes where possible. Do-it-yourself cervical tests are available in some countries, and researchers at King's College London trialled them in London in 2021 with \"fantastic\" results. They involve doing a vaginal swab which is then sent to a lab.",
      "The NHS said last year it was assessing whether to roll the scheme out more widely.",
      "Eleanor says she felt \"reassured\" knowing that a healthcare professional performed her first screening, but would try doing an at-home version of the test after that if the option were available.",
      "Jack, on the other hand, has his doubts. He says he'd prefer an at-home kit for \"the convenience and flexibility\" but that he'd \"have some hesitation about whether I'd done it correctly\".",

      "It said it will reform the \"archaic\" planning rules which ministers believe have held Britain back in the global race for clean, secure and affordable energy.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the country had been \"let down and left behind\" because it had not built a nuclear power station in \"decades\" - and the plans will create thousands of highly skilled jobs.",
      "Unions and business groups welcomed the move, but environmentalists criticised the government, saying it had \"swallowed nuclear industry spin whole\".",

      "The plans announced on Thursday will mark the first time SMRs will be included in planning rules. A list of the only places a nuclear reactor could be built will also be scrapped. The list was made up of just eight sites.",
      "Currently, progress building nuclear power stations in the UK can be slow - to get from planning to \"power on\" can take nearly 20 years.",

    "story": [
      "The government's idea of re-designating areas as \"grey belt\" land in its bid to build more homes is \"largely redundant\", a House of Lords committee has said.",
      "Ministers had said that, if a council's housing targets could not be met, some protected land known as green belt would be re-labelled grey belt and thereby freed up for development.",
      "However, after conducting an inquiry the committee said it suspected the grey belt concept had been \"eclipsed by more significant changes\" made by the government.",
      "A government spokesperson said its changes to the green belt were \"just one of the ambitious housing reforms we have set out to solve the housing crisis and boost economic growth\".",
      "They added that the measures were \"informed through widespread consultation and will unlock more land for the homes and infrastructure communities desperately need, delivering sustainable, affordable and well-designed developments on low quality grey belt\".",
      "Since coming to power in July, the Labour government has said it wants to build 1.5 million homes over the next five years and has identified \"poor quality\" green belt land as possible areas of construction.",
      "It pointed to a disused garage in Tottenham, north London, as an example of land that could not be developed because it was deemed to be on a green belt site.",
      "Green belts were established more than 70 years ago with five purposes, including restricting the sprawl of urban areas and protecting the countryside.",
      "In a letter to Housing Secretary Angela Rayner, chair of the Built Environment Committee Lord Moylan said the green belt had been treated as \"sacrosanct\"  making it difficult for local authorities to build on the area, despite a high demand for more homes.",
      "He said the idea of a grey belt had initially \"intrigued\" committee members who believed it could \"make a positive contribution\" to meeting housing targets.",
      "Some councils ordered to increase home building by 400%, new BBC tracker shows",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Housing plans not war on rural England, says minister",
      "What is the 'grey belt' and how many homes could Labour build on it?",
      "However, he said that changes announced in the National Planning and Policy Framework (NPPF) would mean that the impact of the grey belt would be \"at best, marginal\".",
      "The changes include a requirement for councils to review green belt boundaries and suggest changes to the boundaries if they cannot meet their housing targets.",
      "Under the new rules, building on green belt land will be be allowed if other options have been exhausted, the government has said.",
      "\"It is difficult to see what the grey belt regime will add in terms of the ability to build on the green belt in light of this requirement,\" Lord Moylan said.",
      "In the course of taking evidence the committee heard dramatically differing estimates of how many dwellings could be built on grey belt land.",
      "Homebuilders Barratt Redrow suggested the number could be as low as 50,000, while LandTech, a software company, put the figure at four million.",
      "Responding to the inquiry's conclusions, Fergus Charlton, a planning partner at firm Michelmores, said: \"Whether or not the grey belt policies will play an effective role in achieving the government's difficult to reach 1.5 million new homes target will become clearer as the policies begin to play a defining role in plan making.",
      "\"In the realm of decision-taking they are already playing a key role in the outcome of appeals where green belt land is considered by inspectors to be grey belt.",
      "\"We have seen more than a handful of successful appeals in the eight weeks since the grey belt concept was confirmed in the NPPF.\""

      "And what might President Trump make of it all, with some in the UK advocating a deeper trading relationship with America and the spectre of tariffs still hovering if the president feels piqued?",
      "Polling trends",

      "Another poll, by YouGov, puts Reform UK \u2013 proud champions of Donald Trump and of Brexit \u2013 ahead of both the Conservatives and Labour for the first time.",
      "The lead over Labour is within the margin of error, and the outcome of any single poll should be treated with some scepticism.",
      "But trends in polls do matter, and the trend has been an upward one for Reform.",
      "Its growth in support is something both the Conservatives and Labour are well aware of.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 18:32:13 GMT",
    "summary": "How might the UK be affected by Trump's tariffs, even if they are not imposed on the UK?",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has been unclear about whether he will impose tariffs on the UK but  economists warn there are still ways Britain could be negatively affected by the president's wider trade policies even if it avoids being hit directly.",
      "The impact could be felt through slower growth in some of the UK's important trading partners. Industrial exports could be diverted from the US and flood the UK market and there could be impacts on our financial markets, including a possible increase to borrowing costs.",
      "Asked about future tariffs, Trump told the BBC on Sunday night: \"The UK is way out of line but I'm sure that one\u2026 I think that one can be worked out.\"",
      "The president did not specify in which way he regarded the UK as being \"out of line\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given for imposing tariffs on countries is they have a trade surplus with the US - in other words they sell more to the US than they import from America.",
      "He has claimed these trade surpluses amount to \"massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico\".",
      "The tariffs on Mexico were paused for a month by Trump on Monday but the president has complained about unbalanced trade with the EU, saying on Sunday: \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products.\"",
      "So one way the UK might be seen to be out of line in the mind of Trump - and at risk of tariffs - is if Britain was also running a trade surplus with America.",
      "Does the UK have a trade surplus with the US?",
      "The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates the UK had a surplus of around \u00a371bn in trade with the US in 2023, the most recent full year for which we have data.",
      "But the American statistics office, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the US had a surplus on its trade with the UK in that year of $14.5bn, around \u00a312bn.",
      "How can both be true?",
      "The two stats agencies have looked at this discrepancy and agree it is due to different ways of measuring trade.",
      "One factor is the UK agencies, unlike their US counterparts, do not count trade flows through British crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man, some of which are significant financial services hubs and markedly affect the overall figures.",
      "Another key, related, element seems to be differences in the measurement of services trade - things such as banking and finance - as opposed to physical goods.",
      "But the bottom line is there is still a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is driving the overall difference in the statistics and both agencies are trying to work it out.",
      "In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade.",
      "If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures.",
      "Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a35.2bn.",
      "While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them.",
      "How else could the UK be affected?",
      "There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries.",
      "Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects.",
      "If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive.",
      "\"The US imposing tariffs on our other trading partners will still have a negative effect on the UK economy through its effect on supply chains and the exchange rate,\" said Ahmet Kaya, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).",
      "Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025.",
      "Some economists warn exports - such as Chinese-made steel - that might get diverted from the US markets due to the new tariffs, could be sold at below the cost of production, or \"dumped\" in UK markets, which might have a negative impact on the sales of UK steel producers.",
      "Some analysts say higher US interest rates as a result of the tariffs could also spill over to UK borrowing markets.",
      "One of the reasons UK government borrowing costs, or Gilt yields, temporarily spiked upwards in January, was because American government bond yields had also risen.",
      "\"The main threat to the UK economy from Trump's tariffs may well be the spillover from higher US interest rates, rather than tariffs themselves,\" says the economist Julian Jessop.",
      "\"US and UK government bond yields are now moving in lockstep again. If the Fed [US central bank] is more reluctant to cut US rates, as seems likely, borrowing costs will be higher for longer in the UK as well.\"",
      "Higher borrowing costs could slow the UK economy and also put pressure on the UK government to cut public spending or raise taxes in order to keep within its chosen borrowing rules.",
      "Correction: This article has been changed \u2013 the worth of power generation machinery to the US in 2023 was \u00a35.2bn.",

    "story": [
      "When Sir Keir Starmer was preparing to run for the Labour leadership in 2020, his campaign director told the future prime minister what mattered to the party.",
      "Morgan McSweeney emphasised that whatever their faction, Labour members shared certain core principles - and top of the list was a commitment to combatting poverty and defending the welfare state.",
      "That is why any Labour politician treads carefully when looking at welfare reform.",
      "This government, though, is not just looking at reforming welfare  - it is preparing to put it at the heart of its economic agenda.",
      "In Rachel Reeves's big speech on growth this week, she vowed that to achieve \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system, the government would look at areas that have been \"ducked for too long, like the rising cost of health and disability benefits\".",
      "What did that mean?",
      "The question is being frantically addressed between the Treasury and the Department of Work of Pensions (DWP) right now.",
      "Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, will present a \"green paper\" - or policy proposals - on welfare reform in just over a month, designed to demonstrate how serious the government is about finding ways to get more people into work - and save money from the welfare budget.",
      "That dual motive explains why this is being treated as such an urgent issue at the top of government.",
      "Ministers are concerned by a situation in which the amount of people who are in receipt of certain benefits has surged. Meanwhile, the Treasury needs to ensure that it is not on course to break its own self-imposed fiscal rules.",
      "\"It's high up the agenda for us because of the cost implications but also the broader economic problem of having so many people economically inactive,\" a Treasury source said.",
      "And in 10 Downing Street, aides say that tackling this issue would be the clearest sign yet that Sir Keir is truly serious about reforming public services.",
      "Last year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around \u00a3100bn before the next general election.",
      "Some of this is the legacy of Covid. But the chancellor has made clear her view that another reason for this surge is the \"perverse incentives\" wired into the system.",
      "Again and again, ministers and officials complain of a system where those on universal credit are required to display evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.",
      "Ministers believe that this encourages some people to \"game the system\". Some Labour advisers fear this issue is being exacerbated, especially among young people, by videos on TikTok and other platforms which explain to claimants the best ways to fill out questionnaires in order to get sickness benefits.",
      "One option officials are examining is whether there should be \u2013 as in the past - a third path whereby some people on sickness benefits are required to seek work - but without the risk that they lose their sickness benefits.",
      "\"Lots of people tell us they're scared to go to work in case it doesn't work out and they then can't go back to the safety net,\" a senior government source said.",

      "DWP must focus on work not welfare, says minister",
      "Some in government say this may need more frequent assessments of claimants' health, but those involved in discussions acknowledge that being required to explain their condition to the DWP can often be \"traumatic\", \"humiliating\" and \"terrifying\" for vulnerable claimants.",
      "Better training and coaching can help, but the amount of money involved may not sit well with a Treasury that's in savings mode.",
      "That's complicated enough - and that's before you even get to the finances and the politics.",
      "On the finances, this round of welfare reform is designed to generate savings that can be \"scored\", in other words accounted for, by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the next Budget in the autumn.",
      "But those involved in past Budgets caution that it is \"basically impossible\" to persuade the OBR that the savings will actually happen.",
      "And then there's the politics.",
      "As McSweeney, now Sir Keir's chief of staff, found - the Labour Party is deeply committed to the welfare state and deeply anxious about anything which looks like the safety net is fraying.",
      "That's not just true of party members but MPs too. Among the vast 2024 intake of Labour MPs, one of their most common reasons for getting involved in the Labour Party was opposition to Conservative austerity and welfare cuts.",
      "That means that even some of those most loyal to Starmer and Reeves are privately expressing significant anxiety about the direction of travel.",
      "Some of these tensions are beginning to spill into public view.",
      "At PMQs this week Debbie Abrahams, the Labour chair of the work and pensions select committee, said that \"speculation\" about billions of pounds of savings to be found from the social security budget had left \"many vulnerable claimants [feeling] worried\".",
      "She warned the prime minister that \"language matters\".",
      "Senior Labour figures involved in the discussions are adamant that it is Reeves and Starmer who are in line with public opinion, not concerned Labour MPs.",
      "One complained: \"If you ask Labour MPs whether they'd rather be on the side of the public or on the side of a lot of the Labour movement and vocal disability campaigners - well, for some of them that's a marginal call.\"",
      "Others caution about public opinion on this issue though: \"The public think they support welfare cuts until they hear a story about someone they feel sympathy for losing money. Then they don't.\"",
      "Some older hands warn of how quickly the government could be left out of step with its base, pointing to the party's decision to abstain on a Conservative welfare bill in July 2015.",
      "Such was the scale of Labour members' fury that Conservative welfare cuts were not being opposed, it is seen by many as the main reason that Jeremy Corbyn's longshot leadership campaign took off.",

      "He said: \"The welfare system as currently designed traps people out of work and actively denies people who want to work real, genuine help.\"",
      "These political considerations are not new territory for Reeves. She was shadow work and pensions secretary for two years before the 2015 general election.",
      "Her vow that Labour would be \"tougher than the Tories on benefits\" made her deeply controversial with the party's grassroots for years afterwards. Speaking to the New Statesman in 2021, Reeves acknowledged she may have made her point \"badly\", but insisted that \"spending more on benefits wasn't always a sign of success. And actually the benefits bill goes up when society fails.\"",
      "These dilemmas may not be new for Reeves, but they have left some of her colleagues feeling uneasy at best.",

    "title": "Five key impacts of Brexit five years on",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:41:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.",
      "Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify the amount of time EU citizens can spend in the UK, visa free.",

      "It has been a wild January for Rachel Reeves and frankly for economics in the UK and the world.",
      "When Labour swept to victory last summer, Reeves pledged she would be an \"iron\" chancellor, reining in public spending and improving the lives of working people through growing the economy. Without solid public finances, she argued, the government couldn't achieve any of its other aims.",
      "This month has tested that plan.",
      "It started off with a global bond market tantrum - UK borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years and the pound fell sharply.",
      "Some argued that Reeves's Budget decisions had made the UK more vulnerable to such shocks. The prime minister was forced to confirm Reeves had his backing after political opponents called for her resignation.",
      "The market turbulence sparked concerns that a verdict of sorts was being made on the chancellor.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament. That meant, the rise in global and UK debt interest costs would require some spending cuts.",
      "The message was sent out that the government, with its massive majority, could do and would do what it takes to keep to the self-imposed rules, which it said were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The markets have now recovered all their negative moves. Short term and long term government borrowing costs are all lower than at the beginning of the year.",
      "While the \"gilt crisis\" hyperbole was overdone, there have been consequences.",
      "From doom to promises of a boom",
      "The chancellor sped up an already planned \"drumbeat\" of pro-growth measures, culminating in this week's speech. Reeves's counsel of doom and warnings about black holes and pain has been replaced by a promise of an investment boom.",
      "She has vowed a new runway at Heathrow, visas for those with AI and life science skills and said she would ease the non-dom ban to allow a more generous phase out of tax benefits.",
      "Alongside this are plans to make it easier to build, delays to new rules on banks and the ousting of the boss of the competition regulator, which shows she's serious on growth. As Meatloaf might have scripted for her: \"I would do anything for growth\".",
      "But Reeves's plans are not yet a fully fledged growth plan. Her announcements signal that she is willing to take a series of political hits to foster long term growth.",
      "The chancellor will deploy the near total executive power from her party's commons majority to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Some outside advisers who support the chancellor say that stability is not enough, and nor is planning, and nor is deregulation.",
      "Reeves has not pledged any allocation of public money to these grand projects.",
      "Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye sounded a little coy after plans for a third runway were confirmed, saying they would not spend more money on it unless they really believed it was going to happen.",
      "\"This will take years, it will take what I call Churchillian resolve and lots of ingenuity but we can trust a government that will be with us for many years to deliver this,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Reeves's UK growth mission",
      "Reeves is focusing on a very specific type of growth - increasing the supply of goods and services. She believes a lack of this supply side growth has held back the UK, and she is on a mission to remove barriers, and open new markets.",
      "For example, Reeves is very concerned about small businesses who have told her they have given up on exporting to the EU, because post Brexit it is now easier to export to the US.",
      "At a meeting last week, one business told the chancellor that exports to Europe meant for Christmas, had only just arrived.",
      "The problem is that while the chancellor awaits a long term growth spurt, she has prioritised stabilising public finances through significant tax rises.",
      "In April, employers will be hit with an increase in national insurance payments and a higher minimum wage. These costs could be passed on in price rises meaning inflation - already higher than target at 2.5%, could remain sticky.",
      "Reeves would have preferred employers to squeeze pay settlements rather than raise prices or cut staff.",
      "Retail and hospitality businesses using low wage labour will be most impacted by the bumper rise in minimum wages. Downing Street insiders acknowledge that many domestic business bosses are \"grumpy\" as they put it.",
      "The concern is whether the impact will show up in higher unemployment. At last October's Budget, the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted extra government spending would help boost the economy and bring unemployment down to 4% this year. Some outside forecasters now think it will top 5%.",
      "It is a critical few months for the animal spirits in the economy to reignite.",
      "How far will she go?",
      "But how far is Rachel Reeves willing to push this pro-growth agenda?",
      "Will she follow the US away from the decarbonisation path to benefit from cheaper hydrocarbon prices promised by President Trump? Will she accede to construction industry requests to import foreign workers to meet the target to build 1.5 million homes?",
      "Will she push the Brexit reset to remove all the barriers to UK-EU trade in food and farm products, and many goods too? Will she offer Britain to the global tech and pharma industries as a deregulatory haven from the EU and US respectively?",
      "Taken at face value, she will do most of this, with big political consequences. Take the Brexit reset. Cabinet ministers at The World Economic Forum were delighted with the tone of the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic in his interview with me, saying he was open to Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "The arrangement allows for tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.",
      "But if the UK demanded effective single market treatment in certain sectors, it would need to follow the EU rule book in those areas. There would be counter asks, such as extending EU fishing arrangements in UK waters, and some sort of youth cultural exchange scheme.",
      "The need for delicate diplomacy",
      "Push is coming to shove on these issues, and the question is whether the chancellor's pro growth agenda is the overwhelming factor in making decisions. I suspect it is.",
      "However, that approach will require delicate diplomacy in the middle of a potential goods tariff war. If Trump follows through on his threat of a universal tariff then the G7 could decide to coordinate retaliatory tariffs. Does the UK join in?",
      "What if the US decides it wants its allies to help contain China's tech ascendancy? What if Trump wants to deter the UK from rebuilding free-flowing trade with the EU?",
      "The sudden emergence of China's AI expertise via DeepSeek underlines how important it is to be nimble. There was only one mention of China in the government's big AI paper earlier this month - in Science Secretary Peter Kyle's foreword.",
      "The pharma industry is lobbying the government to quietly open the door for relocation of key top talent into the UK, concerned about the Trump / Robert F Kennedy Jr approach to medicines regulation. Our leading universities are saying that for the first time since Brexit, it's easier to recruit some of the very best international scientists who are not keen to bring up their families in Trump's America.",
      "Trump's decision to abandon Biden's green subsidies also levels the playing field for net zero investment here.",
      "After a tumultuous start to the year, with the US administration threatening different tariffs almost every day, and tech giant shares falling over concerns they've been overvalued in the light of China's AI app DeepSeek, the UK remains a safe haven for investors.",
      "The self declared iron chancellor remains very attached to stability. But zero growth is a form of stability too. In choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some very tricky navigation - and it will make some big domestic political waves too.",

    "title": "Record January warmth puzzles climate scientists",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 03:10:59 GMT",
    "summary": "January was expected to be cooler than the same month last year, but was 0.1C warmer, which experts are struggling to explain.",
    "story": [
      "Last month was the world's warmest January on record raising further questions about the pace of climate change, scientists say.",
      "January 2025 had been expected to be slightly cooler than January 2024 because of a shift away from a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "But instead, last month broke the January 2024 record by nearly 0.1C, according to the European Copernicus climate service.",
      "The world's warming is due to emissions of planet-heating gases from human activities - mainly the burning of fossil fuels - but scientists say they cannot fully explain why last month was particularly hot.",
      "It continues a series of surprisingly large temperature records since mid-2023, with temperatures around 0.2C above what had been expected.",
      "\"The basic reason we're having records being broken, and we've had this decades-long warming trend, is because we're increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told BBC News.",
      "\"The specifics of exactly why 2023, and 2024, and [the start of] 2025, were so warm, there are other elements involved there. We're trying to pin those down.\"",
      "January 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate.",
      "Early last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.",
      "This year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect.",
      "While La Ni\u00f1a is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures \u2013 it was expected to lead to a cooler January.",
      "\"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said.",
      "\"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\"",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "A number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated.",
      "One idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "While it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Ni\u00f1a phase from 2020-23.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere.",
      "But it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Ni\u00f1o ended.",
      "\"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife.",
      "The fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "\"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\"",
      "Another prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols.",
      "These tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "Aerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe.",
      "But it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases.",
      "And this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988.",
      "Most scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed.",
      "The \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further.",
      "This theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated.",
      "Currently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 \u2013 but the recent warmth means they can't be sure.",
      "What they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet.",
      "\"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said.",
      "\"Unless we turn off that tap to [greenhouse gas] emissions, then global temperatures will continue to rise.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 13:59:32 GMT",
    "summary": "The process of loosening rules on where reactors could be built began under the previous government.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced plans to make it easier to build mini nuclear power stations in England and Wales, as part of its efforts to boost economic growth.",
      "It said it will reform the \"archaic\" planning rules which ministers believe have held Britain back in the global race for clean, secure and affordable energy.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the country had been \"let down and left behind\" because it had not built a nuclear power station in \"decades\" - and the plans will create thousands of highly skilled jobs.",
      "Unions and business groups welcomed the move, but environmentalists criticised the government, saying it had \"swallowed nuclear industry spin whole\".",
      "In the 1990s, nuclear power generated about 25% of the UK's electricity but that figure has fallen to around 15%, with many of the country's ageing reactors are due to be decommissioned over the next decade.",
      "Mini nuclear power stations - or small modular reactors (SMRs) - are smaller and cheaper than traditional nuclear power plants, and produce much less power.",
      "However, while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "The plans announced on Thursday will mark the first time SMRs will be included in planning rules. A list of the only places a nuclear reactor could be built will also be scrapped. The list was made up of just eight sites.",
      "Currently, progress building nuclear power stations in the UK can be slow - to get from planning to \"power on\" can take nearly 20 years.",
      "Sir Keir acknowledged that at the moment it takes too long to build nuclear plants but told the BBC the changes announced by the government would speed up the process.",
      "Asked if people who live near nuclear infrastructure could get money off their electricity bills, the PM said while this was not part of the announcement the government had already backed the idea of benefits for local communities.",
      "Is nuclear power gaining new energy?",
      "How 'green' and safe is nuclear power?",
      "High UK energy bills blamed on decades of mistakes",
      "Sir Keir said Britain's energy security had been \"held hostage\" by Russian President Vladimir Putin for \"too long\", which has resulted in prices \"skyrocketing at his whims\".",
      "\"I'm putting an end to it - changing the rules to back the builders of this nation, and saying no to the blockers who have strangled our chances of cheaper energy, growth and jobs for far too long,\" he said.",
      "The process of choosing to loosen rules on where nuclear reactors could be built began under Rishi Sunak's Conservative government with a consultation in January 2024.",
      "Ministers said Britain is considered one of the world's most expensive countries in which to build nuclear power, and a new Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce will be established to speed up the approval of new reactor designs and stream line how developers engage with regulators.",
      "Conservative shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie said it was \"about time\" Labour followed his party's lead in recognising the benefits \"of stable, reliable, baseload nuclear power\".",
      "But Doug Parr, policy director of Greenpeace UK, claimed the government had not applied \"so much as a pinch of critical scrutiny or asking for a sprinkling of evidence\".",
      "\"The Labour government has swallowed [the] nuclear industry spin whole,\" he said, adding: \"They present as fact things which are merely optimistic conjecture on small nuclear reactor cost, speed of delivery and safety.\"",
      "While the overall cost of nuclear power is comparable with other forms of energy, nuclear plants are extremely expensive to build.",
      "The head of the Nuclear Industry Association, Tom Greatrex, called the reforms the \"strongest signal yet\" towards growth and clean power.",
      "Gary Smith, GMB's general secretary, said the union has repeatedly said \"there can be no net zero without new nuclear\".",
      "Referring to Sizewell C, the site on the Suffolk coast on which then prime minister Boris Johnson pledged a new nuclear reactor on in 2022, he added: \"[It] stands ready and waiting for the green light to power up our country's future.\"",
      "The government has not yet made a final decision on Sizewell C, which is not due to come until the spending review later this year. The final choice on the design of the SMRs will also come at the same time.",
      "Two new nuclear reactors are also being built at Hinkley Point C in Somerset, which are due to open in 2030.",

    "summary": "The document charred by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius is being 'unwrapped' using X-ray scans and AI.",
    "story": [
      "A badly burnt scroll from the Roman town of Herculaneum has been digitally \"unwrapped\", providing the first look inside for 2,000 years.",
      "The document, which looks like a lump of charcoal, was charred by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD and is too fragile to ever be physically opened.",
      "But now scientists have used a combination of X-ray imaging and artificial intelligence to virtually unfurl it, revealing rows and columns of text.",
      "More work is needed to make the scroll fully legible to decipher its contents, but the team behind the project say the results are very promising.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" said Stephen Parsons, project lead for the Vesuvius Challenge, an international competition attempting to unlock the Herculaneum scrolls.",
      "Some letters are already clearly visible in the ancient text and the team believes it's a work of philosophy.",
      "Hundreds of carbonised scrolls were discovered in Herculaneum, which like its neighbour Pompeii was buried beneath metres of volcanic ash.",
      "In the past, some of the documents, which are made from a thick paper-like material called papyrus, were prised open but they crumbled into pieces.",
      "The University of Oxford's Bodleian Library holds several of the scrolls. Thought to be unreadable, they had been left untouched for decades.",
      "\"We've never been convinced before that any of the techniques would be safe enough or effective enough to get any information from the scrolls,\" explained Nicole Gilroy, head of book conservation.",
      "But the promise of a hi-tech solution prompted the team to get one of the precious scrolls out of storage.",
      "It was placed in a specially made case and taken to Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire.",
      "Inside this huge machine, which is called a synchrotron, electrons are accelerated to almost the speed of light to produce a powerful X-ray beam that can probe the scroll without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimetre,\" explained Adrian Mancuso, director of physical sciences at Diamond.",
      "The scan is used to create a 3D reconstruction, then the layers inside the scroll - it contains about 10m of papyrus - have to be identified.",
      "\"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally,\" said Dr Mancuso.",
      "After that artificial intelligence is used to detect the ink. It's easier said than done - both the papyrus and ink are made from carbon and they're almost indistinguishable from each other.",
      "So the AI hunts for the tiniest signals that ink might be there, then this ink is painted on digitally, bringing the letters to light.",
      "\"We can tell the entire scroll is full of text,\" said Stephen Parsons.",
      "\"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",
      "Last year, a Vesuvius Challenge team managed to read about 5% of another Herculaneum scroll.",
      "Its subject was Greek Epicurean philosophy, which teaches that fulfilment can be found through the pleasure of everyday things.",
      "The Bodleian's scroll is likely to be on the same subject - but the Vesuvius team is calling for more human and computing ingenuity to see if this is the case.",
      "For Nicole Gilroy, the work is providing a link to the past.",
      "\"I just love that connection with whoever collected them, whoever wrote them, whoever rolled those scrolls up and put them on the shelves. There's a real human aspect to it that I just think is really precious,\" she said.",

      "However, after conducting an inquiry the committee said it suspected the grey belt concept had been \"eclipsed by more significant changes\" made by the government.",
      "A government spokesperson said its changes to the green belt were \"just one of the ambitious housing reforms we have set out to solve the housing crisis and boost economic growth\".",
      "They added that the measures were \"informed through widespread consultation and will unlock more land for the homes and infrastructure communities desperately need, delivering sustainable, affordable and well-designed developments on low quality grey belt\".",
      "Since coming to power in July, the Labour government has said it wants to build 1.5 million homes over the next five years and has identified \"poor quality\" green belt land as possible areas of construction.",
      "It pointed to a disused garage in Tottenham, north London, as an example of land that could not be developed because it was deemed to be on a green belt site.",
      "Green belts were established more than 70 years ago with five purposes, including restricting the sprawl of urban areas and protecting the countryside.",
      "In a letter to Housing Secretary Angela Rayner, chair of the Built Environment Committee Lord Moylan said the green belt had been treated as \"sacrosanct\"  making it difficult for local authorities to build on the area, despite a high demand for more homes.",
      "He said the idea of a grey belt had initially \"intrigued\" committee members who believed it could \"make a positive contribution\" to meeting housing targets.",
      "Some councils ordered to increase home building by 400%, new BBC tracker shows",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Housing plans not war on rural England, says minister",
      "What is the 'grey belt' and how many homes could Labour build on it?",
      "However, he said that changes announced in the National Planning and Policy Framework (NPPF) would mean that the impact of the grey belt would be \"at best, marginal\".",
      "The changes include a requirement for councils to review green belt boundaries and suggest changes to the boundaries if they cannot meet their housing targets.",
      "Under the new rules, building on green belt land will be be allowed if other options have been exhausted, the government has said.",
      "\"It is difficult to see what the grey belt regime will add in terms of the ability to build on the green belt in light of this requirement,\" Lord Moylan said.",
      "In the course of taking evidence the committee heard dramatically differing estimates of how many dwellings could be built on grey belt land.",
      "Homebuilders Barratt Redrow suggested the number could be as low as 50,000, while LandTech, a software company, put the figure at four million.",
      "Responding to the inquiry's conclusions, Fergus Charlton, a planning partner at firm Michelmores, said: \"Whether or not the grey belt policies will play an effective role in achieving the government's difficult to reach 1.5 million new homes target will become clearer as the policies begin to play a defining role in plan making.",
      "\"In the realm of decision-taking they are already playing a key role in the outcome of appeals where green belt land is considered by inspectors to be grey belt.",
      "\"We have seen more than a handful of successful appeals in the eight weeks since the grey belt concept was confirmed in the NPPF.\""

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 17:02:12 GMT",
    "summary": "The asteroid named YR4 has a 1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032",
    "story": [
      "UN planetary defence organisations are closely monitoring an asteroid that has a tiny risk of hitting the Earth.",
      "The European Space Agency (ESA) has said that it has an almost 99% chance of safely passing Earth on 22 December 2032, but a possible impact \"cannot yet be entirely ruled out\".",
      "The probability that the asteroid, called 2024 YR4, may impact Earth on 22 December 2032 is currently estimated to be 1.3%.",
      "Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society, says that he is \"not panicking or losing sleep over it\".",
      "\"There is no need for alarm,\" he said. \"The thing about this kind of event is that historically they tend to go away when the calculations are refined.\"",
      "We need to be aware alert and we need to give astronomers the resources they need to track these kinds of threats so that we can take action as soon as possible.\"",
      "YR4 was detected on 27 December 2024. Astronomers calculated that it was between 40m and 90m across. This would have the power of a nuclear bomb were it to hit the Earth and cause severe damage if the impact was in a populated area.",
      "But it is much more likely that YR4 would fall into the ocean or a remote part of the planet. It is too far away from Earth and there are too many uncertainties at this stage to determine where a potential impact could occur in the unlikely event of a collision.",
      "Since early January, astronomers have been using telescopes to calculate the asteroid's size and trajectory more precisely. YR4 is now rated at level 3 out of 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale: \"a close encounter that warrants attention from astronomers and the public\". A collision is only certain when it reaches 8, 9 or 10, with the numbers rising in line with the damage likely caused.",
      "When asteroids are initially calculated to have a small probability of hitting the Earth, that impact probability usually drops to zero after additional observations.",
      "This happened in 2004 when an asteroid called Apophis was calculated to have a 2.7% chance of striking Earth in 2029; further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "Any object that may be more than 50m wide and has a greater than 1% chance of hitting the Earth, triggers a set of precautionary measures. These are to ensure that the threat, however tiny, is closely monitored and, if necessary, steps are taken to nullify it.",
      "The first stage is to activate two UN-endorsed asteroid reaction groups: the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), chaired by Nasa, and the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG), chaired by the European Space Agency.",
      "The SMPAG is having a series of meetings this week to determine its next steps.  It has already concluded that it is too early to take immediate action but said that it would \"monitor the evolution of impact threat and possible knowledge about the size closely\".",
      "Another meeting to take decisions on future activities will be held towards the end of April or early May, or earlier, \"if the evolution of the threat merits\".",
      "If the asteroid's impact probability remains above the 1% threshold, SMPAG will provide recommendations to the UN and may begin to evaluate options.",
      "In the unlikely event YR4 were headed our way, one option would be to divert it by hitting it with a robotic spacecraft, as was successfully tested out with Nasa's Dart mission in 2022. That changed the course of an asteroid that was not on a collision course with the Earth.",
      "\"Nasa's Dart mission showed that we have the means to divert an asteroid, but only if we spot it early enough,\" says Dr Massey.",
      "YR4 is currently moving away from Earth in almost a straight line, making it difficult to accurately determine its precise orbit before it returns towards Earth.",
      "Over the next few months, the asteroid will begin to fade from view, after which  it will be monitored by ground and space telescopes.",
      "According to ESA \"It is possible that asteroid 2024 YR4 will fade from view before we are able to entirely rule out any chance of impact in 2032. In this case, the asteroid will likely remain on ESA's risk list until it becomes observable again in 2028.\""

      "Billionaire businessman Jared Isaacman has a big vision for the future of humanity.",
      "He set off on his first mission to space in 2021 \u2013 a private journey he paid an estimated $200m (\u00a3160m) for \u2013 and announced that he wanted space travel to be for the masses, not only for the 600 who have experienced it to date \u2013 most of them professional astronauts employed by Nasa and the wealthy.",
      "\"We want it to be 600,000,\" he told reporters.",
      "Later, he added: \"I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species\u2026 I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft.\"",
      "Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (\u00a31.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space.",
      "Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule and performing the first commercial spacewalk.",
      "During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock.",
      "The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic \u2013 it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology.",
      "And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still \u2013 being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa.",
      "The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do \u2013 especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX owner Elon Musk to a government role to cut $2 trillion (\u00a31.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.",
      "The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now.",
      "Brink of a second space age?",
      "In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs.",
      "Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values.",
      "And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space.",
      "They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.",
      "On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. \"This second space age has only just begun,\" he wrote.",
      "\"There will inevitably be a thriving space economy \u2013 one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space\u2026 At Nasa, we will\u2026 usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.\"",
      "Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, but Trump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan.",
      "But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets.",
      "That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank.",
      "\"You have a government looking to slash,\" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. \"If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget\u2026",
      "\"This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table.\"",
      "Future of Nasa's moon rocket",
      "One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn) for each and every launch.",
      "By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (\u00a380m) per launch \u2013 and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (\u00a38m) as he develops his system.",
      "Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (\u00a354.5m).",
      "Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further.",
      "Starship and New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But \"that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs\", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University.",
      "\"SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,\" he continues. \"They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs.",
      "\"A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way.",
      "\"There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future.\"",
      "Questions around spiralling costs",
      "The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: \"Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs.",
      "\"Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (\u00a320bn) for key activities\".",
      "Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration \u2013 some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (\u00a3800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 \u2013 but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of \"the telescope that ate astronomy\".",
      "(Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.)",
      "It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s.",
      "Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US.",
      "But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. \"Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue.\"",
      "New light on the 'old way of doing things'",
      "The current model is to give so-called \"cost-plus\" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit.",
      "The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns.",
      "Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things.",
      "\"We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things.\"",
      "Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget.",
      "Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo.",
      "The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job.",
      "SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years \u2013 only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station.",
      "The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule.",
      "\"Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,\" says Prof Logsdon. \"So, shaking up the system is very positive.\"",
      "On the brink of a big shakeup?",
      "Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS \"outrageously expensive\" and said that the major aerospace contractors are \"incentivised to be economically inefficient\".",
      "But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (\u00a320bn) annual budget.",
      "\"Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,\" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress.",
      "Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.",
      "The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt.",
      "\"The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,\" argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House.\"",
      "Where that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy \u2013 Musk \u2013 seated nearby.",
      "Others fear cuts in Nasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme.",
      "Where SpaceX fits in",
      "There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (\u00a316bn) in contracts from government since 2008.",
      "But if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players.",
      "And there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March.",
      "But industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"Isaacman is his own man,\" he adds. \"He is not a disciple of Elon Musk.\"",
      "Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution",
      "Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this time",
      "Future of space travel: Could robots really replace human astronauts?",
      "Ultimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue \u2013 Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion.",
      "But the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception.",
      "\"Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,\" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. \"That is frustrating for all of us.\"",
      "Asked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: \"Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service.",
      "\"The truth of Jared agreeing has something to do with him willing to take on these hard things \u2013 and there are so many hard things\".",

      "A Scottish scheme was originally meant to be operational by 2023 but was delayed after objections from businesses to the inclusion of glass.",
      "It then emerged that the UK government was considering blocking Scotland's plans because it wanted a single scheme for all four nations.",
      "UK ministers eventually decided they would grant an exemption - but only if glass was taken out of the Scottish plans to align it with the scheme it was planning to introduce in England.",

    "summary": "Some scientists fear the risk of a collapse to warm Atlantic currents has not been taken seriously.",
    "story": [
      "Of all the possible climate futures, there's a scenario where the United Kingdom and north-west Europe buck the trend of global warming and instead face plunging temperatures and freezing winters.",
      "It's not the most likely outcome, but a number of scientists fear that the chance of it happening is growing, and that the consequences would be so great that it deserves proper consideration.",
      "They are concerned that the ocean currents that bring warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic could weaken - or even collapse - in response to climate change.",
      "Huge uncertainties remain about when - or even whether - a collapse could happen. So, how likely is it, and what would it mean?",
      "The system of Atlantic currents, called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), is a key reason why the UK is warmer than Moscow, despite being a similar distance from the Equator.",
      "Forming a vital part of our climate system, this conveyor belt distributes energy around the planet, bringing warm, salty water from the tropical Atlantic to cooler regions south of Greenland and Iceland, and also the Nordic Seas.",
      "The warmth from the ocean is transferred to the air above it, helping keep temperatures milder than they otherwise would be.",
      "As this salty water cools, it becomes denser, and sinks, before flowing back towards the southern hemisphere as a deep ocean current. This water eventually gets pulled back up to the surface, and the circulation continues.",
      "But Amoc appears to be getting weaker.",
      "We don't know for sure, because direct and continuous measurements of Amoc strength have only been taken since 2004. That's not long enough to be able to identify a definite change.",
      "But indirect evidence suggests it could have already slowed by around 15% over the last couple of centuries, although not all scientists agree.",
      "One indication is the sediments on the ocean floor. Larger grains indicate a stronger current. By measuring the size of the grains and calculating their age, scientists can estimate how much Amoc has slowed over time.",
      "Another piece of evidence is the so-called 'cold blob' or 'warming hole' in the north Atlantic. This describes a region which appears to have cooled in recent decades, unlike the vast majority of the world.",
      "A slowdown in Amoc - meaning less warmer water would be transported to this region - is seen as a possible culprit.",
      "This is \"a very clear signature and footprint of a classic Amoc slowdown\" says Matthew England, professor of oceanography at the University of New South Wales.",
      "The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects Amoc to weaken this century. But the major concern is that Amoc could suddenly \"switch off\", as appears to have happened repeatedly in the Earth's past.",
      "Today, global warming appears to be making the water in the north Atlantic less salty, due to extra freshwater from a melting Greenland ice sheet and more rainfall.",
      "As fresher water doesn't sink as easily, this is expected to slow the circulation and so bring less saltwater northwards from the tropics.",
      "Beyond a \"tipping point\", this loop could lead Amoc to runaway collapse.",
      "\"We really want to avoid a tipping point because then there's nothing we can do about it,\" warns David Thornalley, professor of ocean and climate science at University College London.",
      "Where might the tipping point be?",
      "No one really knows how close it may be.",
      "In 2021, the IPCC said it had \"medium confidence\" that Amoc would not collapse abruptly this century, although it expected it to weaken.",
      "But some more recent studies have pointed to a growing possibility of Amoc passing a tipping point in the coming decades, beyond which full collapse would be inevitable.",
      "Each study comes with various caveats and uncertainties, and different climate models can give different results for a system as complex as Amoc.",
      "\"We don't believe the idea of an Amoc collapse this century has substantially changed because of these new results,\" cautions Dr Laura Jackson, oceanographer at the Met Office.",
      "But many scientists are growing increasingly concerned. Prof Thornalley argues that, whatever the imperfections of individual studies, taken together they \"lead to a conclusion that we maybe need to be worried\".",
      "Following the new evidence, more than 40 leading ocean and climate scientists signed an open letter last October calling for wider recognition of the \"greatly underestimated\" risks.",
      "That is not to say the signatories believe Amoc will pass a tipping point this century. But they warn it is now enough of a possibility to warrant proper consideration.",
      "\"I'd say you're looking at a risk of reaching a tipping point in the coming decades that could be at the 10 or 20% level even if we hold the line at 2C warming [above temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate],\" warns Tim Lenton, professor of Earth system science at the University of Exeter.",
      "Given the magnitude of the consequences from Amoc collapse, these probabilities \"are not trivial,\" he adds.",
      "What would happen if Amoc collapsed?",
      "Even the most likely scenario - where Amoc continues to weaken this century - could have serious effects.",
      "\"If the Amoc gradually weakens over the next century, you're going to get global warming but less warming over Europe,\" says Dr Jackson.",
      "That would still mean the UK getting hotter summers with climate change, but a weaker Amoc could also fuel more winter storms as regional temperature patterns change.",
      "A full-scale collapse, meanwhile, would be \"like a war situation [\u2026] something almost unimaginable,\" says Prof Lenton.",
      "While it could take a century or more for impacts to play out, temperatures in northern Europe could fall by a couple of degrees a decade.",
      "In the UK, it could \"become horribly, horribly cold \u2026 like living in northern Norway,\" Prof Thornalley warns.",
      "\"Our infrastructure is not set up for that.\"",
      "There could be global consequences too, such as shifts to the tropical rain belts.",
      "\"That's a big story,\" warns Prof Lenton.",
      "\"If you lost the monsoon or seriously disrupted it, you'd have humanitarian catastrophes, in simple terms, in west Africa [and] probably in India.\"",
      "How we prepare for this alternative future poses challenges for governments.",
      "Prof Lenton draws parallels with preparations for the Covid-19 pandemic - another major event which scientists had warned about, but had no way of knowing when it might occur.",
      "But a recent report warned the UK has a \"glaring national security blind spot for climate threats\" such as those posed by Amoc collapse. The government admitted last year that it \"has not assessed the effect of any [Amoc] slowing or collapse\" on economic planning.",
      "Scientists are clear that the fundamental way to reduce these risks is to cut the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change.",
      "\"We're playing a bit of a Russian roulette game,\" warns Prof England.",

      "The first study in the world to look at school phone rules alongside measures of pupil health and education feeds into a fierce debate that has played out in homes and schools in recent years.",
      "Dr Victoria Goodyear, the study's lead author, told the BBC the findings were not \"against\" smartphone bans in schools, but \"what we're suggesting is that those bans in isolation are not enough to tackle the negative impacts\".",

      "It is rare that a video game series becomes so popular it inspires copycats - but it is rarer still that it's so unique it kicks off its own genre.",
      "But that's what happened with Dynasty Warriors, a series which pioneered the so-called \"1 vs 1,000\" gameplay, in which the player defeats thousands of enemies in each level.",
      "Throughout years of development - the series has been going since 1997 on the original PlayStation - hardware limitations meant at its best only a few hundred enemies could appear on-screen at any one time.",
      "But all that is now changing, with the power of modern consoles enabling as many as 10,000 opponents on-screen at once.",
      "In other words, the \"1 vs 1,000\" moniker is finally coming true.",
      "And with that new power comes a new game - after seven years in the wilderness, publisher Koei Tecmo is back with Dynasty Warriors: Origins.",
      "Throughout this period the series has faced a problem - despite selling 21 million copies throughout its history - Dynasty Warriors has always sold significantly better in Japan than in the West.",
      "\"It's something that we've been trying to get a lot of people overseas to play,\" the head of developer Omega Force, Tomohiko Sho, told the BBC.",
      "But times may be changing, as the release of Dynasty Warriors: Origins in January 2025 has seen encouraging sales.",
      "In the UK, it broke the top 10 of the retail sales charts, while online it was the top-selling game on PC retailer Steam - with just under 70,000 people playing the game at the same time on launch.",
      "There have been nine numbered entries in the series since it began in 1997, culminating in 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9 on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.",
      "But advances in hardware mean Mr Sho believes now is the time for a sequel.",
      "Though he did not call it a reboot, the team has ditched the numbered titles and simply called the game Dynasty Warriors: Origins - perhaps signalling that the studio believes this is a turning point for the franchise.",
      "It released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2025, becoming the first mainline entry in the series in seven years.",
      "Mr Sho told the BBC the team had been working on a sequel - which would have been called Dynasty Warriors 10 - but he felt it was simply too similar to previous games, which fans were \"starting to get a bit bored of\".",
      "Instead, the long-awaited game was scrapped in order to take advantage of the new hardware.",
      "DW10 cancelled",
      "The reason Dynasty Warriors: Origins seeks to break away from what came before is simple, Mr Sho said - it was a result of fan reaction to the last mainline game released in the series, 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9.",
      "\"Either you really liked it, or you didn't,\" he said.",
      "The unreleased sequel was too similar to what came before, he said, but by the time development was in full swing, a change in the games industry ultimately halted production.",
      "Within two days of each other in November 2020, Sony released the PlayStation 5 and Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X - consoles so powerful Mr Sho ceased development to focus on the new hardware.",
      "\"The current technology allows us to have many troops and army officers on the screen,\" he said.",
      "\"This is something I've been wanting to do since Dynasty Warriors 2 and 3.\"",
      "Those two games, which released on PlayStation 2 back in 2000 and 2001, could at most manage twenty or thirty enemies on-screen at once.",

      "\"We're able to have many troops on-screen - not just thousands, but tens of thousands,\" Mr Sho said.",
      "\"With the current generation of consoles, we're able to do that.\"",
      "But all that power comes with a cost - no multiplayer, which has been a staple of the series since its PlayStation 2 days.",
      "\"I am very aware that it is seen as an iconic part of the series,\" he said.",
      "He felt multiplayer would result in a \"performance loss\", meaning fewer enemies on screen, so he decided against including it.",
      "But he said that may change if the game were given a sequel.",
      "\"If everyone really enjoys the game, then for the next game in the series, we will definitely have multiplayer,\" he said.",
      "Spin-offs and future",
      "In the interim years between the release of Dynasty Warriors 9 and Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the team has focussed on other things - namely spin-offs.",
      "These are versions of the game, within the 1 vs 1,000 genre, outside of the main series that typically feature different characters - much like how the film franchise Puss in Boots was a spin-off of Shrek.",
      "The company has found success in this area with games featuring characters from series such as Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda and Sega's Persona 5.",
      "Mr Sho said Dynasty Warriors: Origins was a shift in direction as it focused on performance - while spin-offs were about being true to the franchises involved.",
      "\"When the teams were approaching development, they weren't thinking about the hardware,\" he said.",
      "\"But more, with Hyrule Warriors and Fire Emblem Warriors being on the Switch, how would we be able to do that best as a Warriors game?\"",

      "\"I also actually like Sonic, just to let you know,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The Microsoft co-founder says he enjoys giving away his fortune and it won't leave his kids poor.",
    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

      "Cooper said AI was \"industrialising the scale\" of sexual abuse against children and said government measures \"may have to go further.\"",
      "Other laws set to be introduced include making it an offence to run websites where paedophiles can share child sexual abuse content or provide advice on how to groom children. That would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "And the Border Force will be given powers to instruct individuals who they suspect of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection when they attempt to enter the UK, as CSAM is often filmed abroad. Depending on the severity of the images, this will be punishable by up to three years in prison.",

      "These videos \"involve adult actors but they look very young and are shown in children's bedrooms, with toys, pigtails, braces and other markers of childhood,\" she said. \"This material can be found with the most obvious search terms and legitimises and normalises child sexual abuse.

    "story": [
      "\"I have so much money now that I could hire someone to kill you, and nobody would know. No-one would miss you. No-one would know anything.\"",
      "Former music executive Daniel Evans says he can still remember the threat from his old boss, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs - then known as Puff Daddy - to a colleague. It was 1997, he says, in the New York office of Combs's Grammy Award-winning music label Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"It was like, this is what money does to you,\" he says.",
      "Combs was often \"prickly\", but Evans says power was transforming him. Just days before, the hip-hop mogul had received his biggest reward to date \u2013 $6m (\u00a34.8m) to mark the label's success, which boasted platinum-selling artists like The Notorious B.I.G.",
      "That year Combs's music career reached its peak, with his empire soon expanding into fashion, alcohol and even his own TV network.",
      "Nearly three decades on, his legacy is in ruins as he sits in jail awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering alongside battling dozens of lawsuits accusing him of drugging and assault at lavish parties, high-end hotels and in his label's recording studio. He denies all the allegations.",
      "Now the BBC has spoken to more than 20 people who worked with Combs at Bad Boy Records - including former executives, assistants and producers - who describe for the first time troubling incidents they say they witnessed during its 1990s rise.",
      "Some executives say they had concerns after seeing Combs having sex with women in the studio, including one incident where the employee says the young woman did not seem to react when he walked in. Another staff member complained Combs asked her to bring him condoms.",
      "The BBC also heard that corporate funds were used to fly in women from across the US for sex at the request of artists and other employees.",
      "\"There was a course of conduct that became more egregious over time and that conduct does go back to the 90s,\" says Tony Buzbee, a US lawyer representing dozens of alleged victims, including one who says Combs threatened to kill her in similar terms to the incident Evans says he witnessed.",
      "His client alleges Combs raped her on a bathroom floor at a promotional party held for The Notorious B.I.G., the label's biggest star, in 1995. She says in her lawsuit that afterwards, Combs told her not to tell anyone or \"you will disappear\".",
      "In a statement, Combs's legal team accused Buzbee of being \"more interested in media attention than the truth\" and said the hip-hop star \"never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone\".",
      "The 55-year-old's lawyers said they had not been provided with sufficient details about the BBC's claims to present the facts that would \"counter these fabricated accusations\".",
      "\"As we've said before, Mr Combs cannot dignify every publicity stunt or facially absurd claim with a response. He has full confidence in the judicial process, where the truth will prevail: these accusations are pure fiction,\" they said.",
      "A brash go-getter, Sean Combs became an overnight millionaire when he launched Bad Boy Records in 1993 with a roster of top artists.",
      "It was Combs's first venture, having already built a name for himself as a talent director at another music label, Uptown Records, aged 19.",
      "\"He said that he wanted to be one of the biggest artists in the world and it didn't matter if I believed him or not,\" remembers Jimmy Maynes, a former Uptown colleague.",
      "Maynes remembers Combs having a short fuse in the office, sometimes banging \"his hands up against the desk\" like a \"bratty kid\" and yelling if he did not get his way.",
      "Combs was eventually fired from Uptown and at the age of 23 started Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"He's the hardest working man that I've ever met and always wanted people to match his energy,\" says Daniel Evans, a senior executive who managed Bad Boy's recording budgets and artists' contracts between 1994 and 1997.",
      "Combs described himself as the \"Great Gatsby\" and swiftly became known for hosting coveted celebrity bashes at New York nightclubs, on the beaches of Cancun, Mexico, and later infamous \"White Parties\" - named after the all-white dress code - in the Hamptons.",
      "Even President Donald Trump attended events in the 90s, says Evans, who once saw him sit on a golden throne at Combs's 30th birthday and exclaim: \"I'm the real King of New York!\"",
      "\"We were all really young. I was 24 years old,\" reflects Evans, who was one of the label's original employees. \"People wanted to party, have fun, hook up and build good memories.\"",
      "But looking back, Evans says he is troubled by some of the things he witnessed about his boss's behaviour and the company culture.",
      "In about 1995, he says he walked in on Combs having sex with a young woman at Daddy's House, Bad Boy's New York recording studio near Times Square.",
      "\"I was getting ready to go home for the night and looking for my jacket. Open the door and he's having sex with this girl,\" says Evans, who thought the studio was empty as it was silent. Combs swore and shouted at him to leave. \"I thought I was getting fired,\" he says.",
      "Evans remembers the young woman had been brought to the studio, presumably for a tour, by a party-promoter who was a friend of Combs. His boss seemed sober, while she was quiet and did not really talk, he says, wondering if she was high on drugs or just shy.",
      "He says it did not seem unusual at the time. But recalling how the woman did not react when he entered the room, he says: \"Knowing what I know now, there's a lot of speculation about what state she was in\u2026 usually both parties are very responsive during the act.\"",
      "Felicia Newsome, the manager of Daddy's House recording studio between 1994 and 2000, says inappropriate conduct in the music industry as a whole was rife at the time.",
      "\"It was abnormal if somebody reported it, but it wasn't abnormal for it to be happening,\" she says.",
      "Newsome says an employee once called her to the studio in the middle of the night because Combs was in his underwear, about to have sex with a model and another woman. He was demanding the staff member fetch him condoms, she recalls.",
      "\"I said to Puffy, don't ever ask anyone here to go and get condoms,\" says Newsome, who arrived while they were getting dressed again. \"He replied: 'I didn't need anything like that, ma,' and never did it again.\"",
      "Newsome, then in her 30s, says she found Combs reasonable and that he changed his behaviour when she challenged him. On one occasion, when the studio first opened in 1995, she says Combs was unhappy about the look of the countertops and called her a \"bitch\" in front of staff.",

      "She says she demanded a public apology and temporarily shut the studio, asking him: \"If I'm bringing women into this space, which is open 24 hours, how do you want to treat people?\"",
      "Combs responded that he wanted it to be an inclusive and safe environment, she says.",
      "But while Newsome ran the studio with an \"iron fist\", she says other staff were less comfortable calling Combs out.",
      "\"Bad Boy Records was a crazy house with a lot of young people who wanted to touch the King's robes,\" she says.",
      "Former staff say the label was run by twenty-something executives and a large number of interns, some of whom were of school age. There were often sexual relationships between employees and the interns, they say.",
      "Evans remembers an uncomfortable moment with a 14-year-old in his own team, who he says propositioned him.",
      "\"She says to me, you work really hard. If you ever want to like, get loose, you and I should kick it\u2026 but not tonight, I have a curfew.\"",
      "Evans says he sent her home and called the next day, telling her not to return to work. He did not report her, but two weeks later she was back working in the mailroom.",
      "Artists and other employees at Combs's record label would sometimes also request for women to be flown in to have sex at the studio, the former executive says.",
      "\"If they had a [sexual] specialty in something, they would be flown in,\" says Evans, who told the BBC he knew because he controlled the budgets. Money for the flights would be set aside and logged under travel, he adds.",
      "\"It was probably like thousands of dollars,\" says Evans. \"I don't think it happened all that often, but it was definitely a recording expense.\"",
      "Evans says Combs's own requests were managed by his personal assistants. One told the BBC that Combs would often ask them to fly in women he was \"messing around with\" and put them up in hotels, though the assistant said they were not sex workers.",
      "In the 2000s, the Daddy's House recording studio further changed, two former staff say, into a culture of \"sex, drugs and rock'n'roll\". Combs would regularly bring \"random women\" there to party, turning up with an entourage of dozens of people in \"three white jeeps, with white rims and white leather seats\", they say. Other artists would demand suitcases of Ciroc vodka and one even brought a monkey to a session, according to a former executive.",
      "The studio is one of the locations where women have since accused Combs of drugging and raping them. Model Crystal McKinney alleges the mogul plied her with alcohol and marijuana before sexually assaulting her there in 2003. That same year, a woman alleges that Combs and two associates gang raped her at the studio when she was 17.",
      "Combs's lawyers say he \"looks forward to proving his innocence\", adding that McKinney's claims are \"without merit\".",
      "Many ex-staff say they still find it hard to reconcile the allegations with the man they knew. \"These accusations are a surprise to me, as I am sure it is to many of our circle,\" says Jeffery Walker, a close friend of Combs who was part of Bad Boy's original production team. \"I've been to White Parties and of course studio sessions, and none of what he is accused of went down in my sight.\"",
      "Evans was also sceptical about some of the claims until he saw the footage of Casandra Ventura, Combs's ex-partner of 10 years and a former Bad Boy artist, being brutally beaten by the rapper in a hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Ventura was the first person to sue Combs back in November 2023, alleging that he had trapped her in a cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking during their relationship. Combs settled the lawsuit the next day for an undisclosed amount.",
      "\"It's not the first time I've seen that temper,\" recalls Evans, thinking back to the death threat he says he witnessed back in 1997. \"It's hard to see. The guy in the video with Cassie is almost identical to the guy who threatened the employee. So, you wonder, has anything changed?\"",
      "Over the years, Sean Combs has repeatedly reinvented himself - from Puff Daddy, to P Diddy and in recent years, \"Love\".",
      "\"If I'm acting crazy, like 'ahhh!' that's Diddy. If I'm dancing real smooth with a girl, that's Puff Daddy. And if I'm looking like I'm nervous or scared or shy, that's Sean,\" he said in an interview in 2015.",
      "With more details likely to emerge when he goes on trial in May, many of those who were close to the rapper are questioning whether they knew the real Sean Combs at all.",
      "\"One could think that he's just a disgusting human being, but that's not my memory of Puff,\" says Jimmy Maynes, who grew up with Combs in Mount Vernon, New York.",
      "But after a pause, he adds: \"Or maybe money just gives people the freedom to be exactly who they really are, and he was that guy all along.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 03:10:59 GMT",
    "summary": "January was expected to be cooler than the same month last year, but was 0.1C warmer, which experts are struggling to explain.",
    "story": [
      "Last month was the world's warmest January on record raising further questions about the pace of climate change, scientists say.",
      "January 2025 had been expected to be slightly cooler than January 2024 because of a shift away from a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "But instead, last month broke the January 2024 record by nearly 0.1C, according to the European Copernicus climate service.",
      "The world's warming is due to emissions of planet-heating gases from human activities - mainly the burning of fossil fuels - but scientists say they cannot fully explain why last month was particularly hot.",
      "It continues a series of surprisingly large temperature records since mid-2023, with temperatures around 0.2C above what had been expected.",
      "\"The basic reason we're having records being broken, and we've had this decades-long warming trend, is because we're increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told BBC News.",
      "\"The specifics of exactly why 2023, and 2024, and [the start of] 2025, were so warm, there are other elements involved there. We're trying to pin those down.\"",
      "January 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate.",
      "Early last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.",
      "This year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect.",
      "While La Ni\u00f1a is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures \u2013 it was expected to lead to a cooler January.",
      "\"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said.",
      "\"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\"",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "A number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated.",
      "One idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "While it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Ni\u00f1a phase from 2020-23.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere.",
      "But it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Ni\u00f1o ended.",
      "\"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife.",
      "The fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "\"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\"",
      "Another prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols.",
      "These tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "Aerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe.",
      "But it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases.",
      "And this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988.",
      "Most scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed.",
      "The \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further.",
      "This theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated.",
      "Currently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 \u2013 but the recent warmth means they can't be sure.",
      "What they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet.",
      "\"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said.",
      "\"Unless we turn off that tap to [greenhouse gas] emissions, then global temperatures will continue to rise.\"",

    "summary": "Washington had suggested Panama had agreed to no longer charge fees for US government vessels using the waterway.",
    "story": [
      "Panama has denied making changes to allow US government vessels to transit the Panama Canal for free, following White House claims it had agreed to such a move.",
      "The State Department said in a statement on X that its government vessels \"can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the US government millions of dollars a year\".",
      "Responding to the comments, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) said it was \"empowered to set tolls and other fees for transiting the canal,\" adding that it had \"not made any adjustments to them\".",
      "US President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced his desire to retake control of the waterway, which is key to global trade.",
      "The 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal cuts across the Central American nation and is the main link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has been on a visit to Latin American countries this week, demanded that Panama make \"immediate changes\" to what he calls the \"influence and control\" of China over the canal.",
      "America's top diplomat said Panama had to act or the US would take necessary measures to protect its rights under a treaty between the two countries.",
      "During a visit to the country, Rubio met Panama's President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, as well as the canal's administrator, Ricaurte V\u00e1squez Morales.",
      "The ACP said after his visit that it had conveyed its intention to work with the US navy to optimise transit priority for its vessels through the canal.",
      "This commitment for dialogue with Washington remained, it said in a separate statement on Wednesday.",
      "Does China 'operate' Panama Canal, as Trump says?",
      "Rubio demands Panama 'reduce China influence' over canal",
      "US vessels make up a significant proportion of traffic in the canal. In 2024, 52% of transits through the waterway had ports of origin or destination in the United States, according to the canal's authorities.",
      "Up to 14,000 ships use the canal each year to avoid a lengthy and costly trip around the tip of South America.",
      "In his inaugural speech, President Trump said he planned to \"take back\" the canal, alleging that China was operating it and Panama had \"broken\" a promise to remain neutral.",
      "The plan was strongly rejected by Mulino, who said the key trade route \"is and will remain\" in the country's hands.",
      "He also rejected Trump's allegations about China's influence, saying there is \"no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration\".",
      "Trump recently reiterated his claim. Despite saying earlier this week he was \"not happy\" with the situation, he acknowledged that Panama had \"agreed to certain things\". Mulino has said his country will not continue its membership in China's infrastructure-building programme, the Belt and Road Initiative.",
      "The US built the canal in the early 20th Century but, after years of protest, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama in 1977 to gradually hand back control of the waterway, which Trump has branded \"a big mistake\"."

    "story": [
      "All South Korean airports will need to install bird detection cameras and thermal imaging radars, after an air crash in December last year killed 179 people.",
      "The rollout is set to happen in 2026.",
      "Investigators said last week that they had found evidence of a bird strike on the Boeing 737-800 plane - with feathers and blood stains found on both the plane's engines.",
      "An investigation into the crash - the deadliest on South Korean soil - is still ongoing but will focus on the role of the bird strike as well as a concrete structure at the end of the runway, which the plane slammed into after making an emergency landing.",
      "\"Bird detection radars will be installed at all airports to enhance early detection of distant birds and improve response capabilities for aircraft,\" said the Ministry of Land in a statement on Thursday.",
      "Bird detection radar detects the size of birds and their movement paths and relays this information to air traffic controllers.",
      "The ministry added that all airports would also need to be equipped with at least one thermal imaging camera.",
      "Currently only four airports in South Korea are equipped with thermal imaging cameras. It is unclear if any of them have bird detection radars in place.",
      "Sites that attract birds, like rubbish dumps, must also be moved away from airports.",
      "Earlier last month, South Korea announced that seven airports would have their runway safety areas adapted following a review of all the country's airports that was carried out after the crash.",
      "The cause of the crash is still unknown but air safety experts had earlier said the number of casualties could have been much lower if not for the structure that the plane crashed into after making an emergency landing.",
      "On 29 December, the plane, from budget airline Jeju Air, had taken off from Bangkok and was flying to Muan International Airport in the country's south-west.",
      "At about 08:57 local time, three minutes after pilots made contact with the airport, the control tower advised the crew to be cautious of \"bird activity\".",
      "At 08:59, the pilot reported that the plane had struck a bird and declared a mayday signal.",
      "The pilot then requested permission to land from the opposite direction, during which it belly-landed without its landing gear deployed. It overran the runway and exploded after slamming into the concrete structure, a preliminary investigation report concluded.",
      "Flight data and cockpit voice recorders stopped recording four minutes before the disaster, an investigation into the black boxes later found.",
      "The 179 passengers onboard the Boeing B737-800 plane were aged between three and 78 years old, although most were in their 40s, 50s and 60s. Two cabin crew members were the only survivors.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 23:49:37 GMT",
    "summary": "The tariffs and US President Donald Trump's '51st State' comments have made way for a surge of patriotism in Canada.",
    "story": [
      "After US President Donald Trump threatened Canada with steep tariffs, Monika Morelli from Montreal cancelled her subscriptions to Netflix and Amazon, two giant American companies.",
      "She also called off a trip that she had planned for later in the year to New Orleans.",
      "\"There is something that has been irrevocably broken now, after centuries of the US and Canada being allies,\" Ms Morelli, 39, told the BBC.",
      "The threaten of import taxes, she said, plus Trump's remarks that Canada could become the 51st US state, \"have made something snap in us all\".",
      "Trump had vowed to slap a 25% tariff on both Canada and Mexico this week, citing issues with border security.",
      "He then struck a surprise deal with Mexico on Monday that resulted in the duties being delayed for 30 days in exchange for more Mexican troops at the border. A similar deal was agreed with Canada later in the day.",
      "For Canadians, who had been deeply anxious about the economic consequences of the tariffs, the delay elicited a sigh of relief. But some feel the threat has caused a rift in the US-Canada relationship.",
      "Data released on Wednesday by national pollster Angus Reid found that 91% of Canadians want their country to rely less on the US in the future, preferring that option over repairing the US-Canada relationship, though more than half still wanted to try.",
      "The opinion survey also noted a big jump in national pride, and found that 90% of Canadians were following this issue closely, mimicking engagement levels not seen since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Shachi Kurl, president of Angus Reid, told the BBC the numbers capture \"a moment of unity\" in the country. They also showed that Canadians have responded to the US tariffs with a shared sense of anger, she said.",
      "With the US being the largest customer for Canadian goods, the tariffs threaten to push the Canadian economy into a recession and put thousands of jobs at risk.",
      "In addition to the tariffs, Trump has stated repeatedly (possibly as a joke) that Canada should instead become a US state to avoid paying the levy - a remark that has been met with fury from Canadians, and has been seen by some as a threat to their sovereignty.",
      "The issue has made way for a surge of patriotism in Canada - notably uniting people from all political stripes at a time when the country had been deeply divided over the leadership of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his policies.",
      "A \"Buy Canadian\" sentiment has been pushed by politicians and the general public, with shoppers wanting to support local businesses and avoid purchasing US-made products in protest over the potential tariffs.",
      "Carole Chandler, a 67-year-old retired public school teacher from Halifax, said that she, like Ms Morelli, had cancelled an upcoming holiday to Florida.",
      "\"I love America and Americans,\" she tells the BBC. \"But I don't want to be one.\"",
      "Even with the temporary pause on tariffs, some Canadian provinces are still pushing ahead with \"Buy Local\" campaigns to encourage people to spend their dollars closer to home.",
      "On Wednesday, Manitoba's premier Wab Kinew said his province will be spending C$140,000 ($97,800; \u00a378,200) on advertising - including on billboards and radio - to push Manitobans to contribute to their local economy.",
      "Provinces are also removing barriers to trade internally within Canada, and many are calling for the country to diversify its trade relationship and build ties elsewhere.",
      "Kinew described the back and forth on the potential tariff war between the US and Canada as akin to \"whiplash\".",
      "\"But through it all, to see people come together and to rally around the flag, to put the Manitoba pride first and foremost, has been very encouraging,\" Kinew said.",
      "Ms Kurl noted that the Canada-US relationship has endured for centuries, and the two countries have long been close allies and partners on the world stage.",
      "\"It's quite an enmeshed relationship,\" she said.",
      "Canadians share not only deep economic ties with the US, but also familial bonds and the world's longest land border. The US has also long been the top travel destination for Canadians.",
      "She said it would not be easy to untangle those ties, and it remains to be seen whether the recent sentiments over Trump's tariffs signal a fundamental shift between the two countries.",
      "A lot of it, she added, could depend on how the relationship with the current US president progresses, and whether the tariff threat materialises.",
      "As Canadians wait and see what happens, they said they were looking to support their own however they can.",
      "\"We don't put on big displays like Americans do,\" said Ms Chandler from Halifax.",

      "The Argentine government led by Javier Milei has announced that it plans to pull out of the World Health Organisation (WHO).",
      "A spokesman for President Milei said the decision to exit the WHO was triggered by \"deep differences regarding health management especially during the [Covid-19] pandemic\".",

      "Some Palestinians would likely choose to leave Gaza and rebuild their lives elsewhere. Since October 2023, as many as 150,000 already have.",
      "But others cannot or will not, either because they lack the financial means to do so or because their attachment to Gaza \u2013 part of the land they call Palestine \u2013 is simply too strong.",
      "Many Gazans are descendants of people who fled or were driven from their homes in 1948 during the creation of the state of Israel - a period Palestinians call the Nakba, the Arabic word for catastrophe.",
      "The thought of another will be too painful for many and they will cling to their reduced lives in what remains of Gaza with a fierce determination.",
      "For Palestinians who dream of a state of their own, alongside Israel, the loss of part of it will feel like an amputation.",
      "Gaza has been physically separated from the West Bank since 1948. Previous rounds of negotiations, as well as Trump's 2020 \"Vision for Peace\", included plans for tunnels or railways that might link the two.",
      "Now Trump is basically telling the Palestinians to give up on Gaza once and for all.",
      "While he does not appear to be advocating the forced deportation of civilians - which is against international law - Trump is clearly encouraging Palestinians to leave.",
      "Palestinian officials have already accused Israel of blocking the supply of tens of thousands of caravans which could help Gazans to stay put in less damaged parts of the territory while reconstruction takes place elsewhere.",

      "These could be the first, tentative signs of an expanded international - and possibly US-led - presence in Gaza.",

      "If Hamas feels the end product of this whole process is a depopulated Gaza - devoid not just of Hamas, but of all Palestinians - it may conclude there is nothing to talk about and hold on to the remaining hostages it took on 7 October 2023.",
      "Netanyahu's critics have accused him of looking for excuses to blow up the negotiations and resume the war. They are bound to conclude that, with these comments, Trump is a willing accomplice.",
      "On the other hand, the Israeli prime minister's right-wing backers have expressed satisfaction with the US takeover plan, potentially reducing the risk of cabinet resignations and making Netanyahu's immediate political future appear more assured.",

      "What did Donald Trump say about the West Bank?",
      "Asked whether he agreed the US should recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, Trump said he had yet to take a position but that he would have an announcement to make in four weeks' time.",
      "That remark has caused alarm among Palestinians, for whom such an announcement would inevitably be seen as another nail in the coffin for a two-state solution.",
      "Recognising the legitimacy of Israel's settlements in the West Bank would be a hugely consequential move. Most of the rest of the world regards them as illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.",
      "During previous rounds of peace talks, negotiators recognised that Israel would get to hold onto large settlement blocs as part of a final agreement, probably in exchange for small chunks of Israeli territory.",
      "In 2020, Trump brokered the Abraham Accords, which secured the historic normalisation of relations between Israel and two Arab nations, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain.",

      "\"USAID's slogan is that this is assistance from the American people. But it turns out that this aid could be stopped by the decision of one person,\" he says.",
      "USAID was established in 1961 by President John F Kennedy. It has around 10,000 employees and a budget of nearly $40bn (\u00a332.25bn), out of a total of $68bn in US government foreign aid spending.",
      "It has bases in more than 60 countries, and works in dozens of others. However, most of the work on the ground is carried out by other organisations that it contracts and funds.",

      "But in countries such as Afghanistan, the end of USAID could cause huge problems. The agency is one of the biggest donors to the country's health sector, funding projects that provide life-saving services to mothers and children.",
      "A doctor responsible for USAID-funded projects there says more than 60 of his team, including midwives, nurses and doctors, were told to stay at home after funding was paused.",

      "\"If an opposition figure, a university student, or a women's rights activist is arrested in Iran, it is NGOs like the one I work for that immediately act so the person's email and social media accounts are locked and removed,\" says the activist, who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisals.",
      "This has meant that if Iranian intelligence agents force detainees to reveal their passwords, they cannot access that person's communications, the activist says.",

    "summary": "The world's richest man has emerged as a dominant force in Trump's second term, gutting an agency and issuing ultimatums to staff.",
    "story": [
      "After days of speculation over the precise role the world's richest man would play in Donald Trump's White House - how much power he would hold, whether he is a government employee at all - he took to the social media platform he owns to clarify.",
      "\"My preferred title is just 'Tech Support,'\" Elon Musk wrote on X on Tuesday. It was a knowing understatement.",
      "As the head of the nascent Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), Musk has emerged as a dominant force in the dizzying start to Trump's second administration.",
      "In just two weeks he has led efforts to seize access to the federal payment system, dismantled an entire agency and offered millions of civil servants an ultimatum - quit or face being fired.",
      "But Musk's increasingly bold attempt to remake the federal government with the same blunt force he used to take control of companies like Twitter have put him on a collision course with the Washington establishment.",
      "And while he has secured a place in Trump's inner circle, observers wonder if a showdown between these two powerful personalities could be looming.",
      "Musk's journey from billionaire entrepreneur to White House power player was not straightforward. By his own accounting, Musk had - for decades - been a reliable vote for the Democrats.",
      "But unhappy with Biden's position on issues from labour laws to transgender rights, Musk began to look to the other side of the aisle in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election.",
      "Initially, Musk called for Trump to \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset\" and had backed his rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, for the Republican nomination. But he soon became the president's biggest booster, contributing $288m to Trump and other Republican candidates and becoming a key adviser on the campaign.",
      "By the time of Trump's inauguration, Musk was his right-hand man, seated just behind the president's left shoulder on the dais - an unmistakable symbol of his influence.",
      "\"You know I always say we have to be protective of our geniuses because we don't have too many. But that one is a good one,\" Trump said of Musk, after welcoming him on stage at a rally the day before.",
      "Musk has been a near constant presence in the nation's capital ever since.",
      "Almost immediately after his election Trump tapped Musk to run Doge, and this new role has seemingly empowered him in a far-reaching mission to slash and transform the federal government, pushing for massive reforms with stunning speed.",
      "Although Trump had said Musk would not be given an office in the West Wing, the tech leader and his team have moved beds into the federal personnel office next door to the White House, according to the New York Times.",
      "He has top secret security clearance, a Trump administration official confirmed, potentially giving him access to a broad swathe of highly classified information.",
      "His tactics - relentless, sometimes ruthless - are reminiscent of how he ran his previous companies, former employees say.",
      "A former programme manager at Tesla, who spoke to the BBC on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said Musk \"did not care\" about the human cost of his decisions.",
      "\"He's only concerned with the objective at hand. I think he views interpersonal issues and conflicts as ancillary things that are not worth his time,\" he said.",
      "Occasionally, Musk tended toward the impulsive. The manager recalled seeing Musk fire a fellow Tesla employee on the spot over an overflowing rubbish can.",
      "\"He interpreted that as a sign that this person didn't take as much pride in his work as he should,\" he said. \"That was the nuance to it\u2026 but at the end of the day someone got fired because they admitted that their trash can was overflowing.\"",
      "The approach yielded a committed workforce, the employee said. If you were on board with Musk's mission, that single-minded focus was motivating, he said, and helped fuel regular 13 plus-hour days on the job.",
      "\"He can get more out of people than anyone else I have ever seen,\" he recalled, although he added that the intensity at Tesla was par for the course in Silicon Valley.",
      "But for those in the federal government, the employee added, \"it's gotta be a culture shock.\"",
      "Nowhere has Musk's purported work on behalf of Trump been felt as intensely as USAID.",
      "The government agency responsible for international development went from dispensing billions in aid to programmes around the world to an effective dead stop in just over two weeks.",
      "Trump already curtailed USAID's work significantly when he ordered a 90-day pause in US foreign spending, while the administration reviewed the funds in order to make sure they were in line with the president's policy goals.",
      "But in recent days, employees have watched with increasing alarm as Musk set his sights directly on USAID, labelling their agency a \"criminal organisation\" on X.",
      "Musk's increasingly harsh rhetoric has coincided with equally drastic changes at USAID.",
      "On 1 February, the USAID website stopped working; its X account appeared to vanish not long after. That same weekend,  two top security officials were placed on administrative leave after a confrontation with Doge representatives over access to a secure facility used for reviewing classified information, the Washington Post and other US outlets reported.",
      "On Monday, USAID employees were told to stay at home while hundreds of employees were locked out of their email. CBS, the BBC's US news partner, reports USAID employees are being pulled out of their respective countries worldwide by Friday.",
      "\"It's beyond repair,\" Musk said of the agency during his 50-minute conversation on X Spaces early Monday morning.",
      "\"I went over it with him in detail, and he agreed that we should shut it down,\" Musk said of his conversation with Trump. \"And I actually checked with him a few times [and] said 'are you sure?'\"",
      "\"The comments from Elon Musk have been particularly cutting, calling us a 'criminal organisation' that needs to 'die,''\" said a USAID staffer, who asked not to be named because they feared retaliation from Musk and the administration.",
      "\"Coming from the wealthiest man on the planet, that feels pretty grotesque,\" said the staffer, who has since been put on administrative leave along with many other colleagues.",
      "\"I see foreign service officers that have spent their entire lives serving - a large part of it overseas - and the sacrifices they made,\" they said. \"To be dragged through the mud like this is disrespectful.\"",
      "The upheaval at USAID has raised concerns from Democrats and experts about whether Trump and Musk's actions are legal.",
      "On its face, efforts by Trump and Musk to shut down USAID are \"not legal because it runs afoul of what Congress has explicitly done previously,\" said Jon Rogowski, a political science professor at the University of Chicago who studies the separation of powers in the US government.",
      "Congress has established USAID as an independent agency, and the legislative branch appropriates funding.",
      "As head of the federal agencies, however, Trump does have broad authority to bring certain USAID functions under the state department's control, according to George Ingram, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former USAID deputy assistant administrator.",
      "One such move included appointing Secretary of State Marco Rubio as the acting head of USAID, when in the past the agency had functioned independently of the state department, while following its guidance on foreign policy.",
      "And influential Republicans in Congress appear ready to work with the administration to allow some degree of change.",
      "\"I'm supportive of the Trump administration's efforts to reform and restructure the agency in a way that better serves US national security interests,\" said Senator James Risch, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
      "Though Musk does not have the authority to shut down or restructure USAID, the agency likely could not have been dismantled as swiftly and thoroughly without his influence.",
      "\"I cannot think of any precedent where a presidential administration has essentially handed over the reins to a private citizen, to remake and take control of the executive branch as they see fit,\" Mr Rogowski said.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Musk \"is selflessly serving President Trump's Administration as a special government employee, and he has abided by all applicable federal laws\".",
      "Prior to Trump's inauguration, some of Musk's peers expressed optimism at the prospect of an injection of start-up culture in Washington.",
      "\"I think we've just had a very exciting moment,\" Marc Benioff, the billionaire founder and CEO of Salesforce who has been vocal in his support of Trump, told the BBC in December. \"It's a new chapter for America.\"",
      "\"There's a lot of incredible people like Elon Musk in the tech industry and in the business community. And if you can tap the power of expertise to make the best of America, that's a great vision,\" he said at the time.",
      "But two weeks into the Trump administration, some observers say not everyone in Silicon Valley is enthusiastic.",
      "Niki Christoff, a former Salesforce executive who now runs a communication firm in DC, told the BBC that many \"people in the [tech] industry seem dumbstruck by the events of the past two weeks\".",
      "\"Most CEOs of publicly traded multinational tech companies want predictability. They want stability. They want a strong dollar,\" she added. \"They want predictable supply chains, and a lot of the policies and the headlines coming out of Washington are creating anxiety and uncertainty.\"",
      "Dr Philip Low, a neuroscientist and CEO of neurotechnology company Neurovigil, said Musk's playbook could wreak havoc on governmental institutions. The two were close for nearly 15 years before their relationship soured, he said.",
      "\"His pattern is to take companies, invest in them, destabilise them, and then take them over,\" said Dr Low, citing Twitter as an example.",
      "\"In that context, the White House is his biggest investment to date. And he is destabilising the American government now.\"",

      "Turmoil as Trump and Musk take aim at top US aid agency",

      "According to Dr Low, Musk will not be satisfied being a trusted deputy, which may set him on a collision course with the president, his boss.",
      "\"Knowing Elon as I do, he doesn't want to be number two or number three. He will want to take over,\" he said.",
      "\"Whatever he decides, goes,\" the former Tesla employee said, echoing Dr Low. \"He never takes no for an answer.\"",
      "After the shake-up at USAID, Trump made it clear that final authority would always rest with him.",
      "When asked if he was happy with Musk after the upending of the agency, he said yes - \"for the most part\".",
      "\"Sometimes we won't agree with it, and we'll not go where he wants to go. But I think he's doing a great job,\" he said on Monday.",
      "\"Elon can't do and won't do anything without our approval, and we'll give him the approval where appropriate. Where it's not appropriate we won't,\" the president said.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 05:41:10 GMT",
    "summary": "The document charred by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius is being 'unwrapped' using X-ray scans and AI.",
    "story": [
      "A badly burnt scroll from the Roman town of Herculaneum has been digitally \"unwrapped\", providing the first look inside for 2,000 years.",
      "The document, which looks like a lump of charcoal, was charred by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD and is too fragile to ever be physically opened.",
      "But now scientists have used a combination of X-ray imaging and artificial intelligence to virtually unfurl it, revealing rows and columns of text.",
      "More work is needed to make the scroll fully legible to decipher its contents, but the team behind the project say the results are very promising.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" said Stephen Parsons, project lead for the Vesuvius Challenge, an international competition attempting to unlock the Herculaneum scrolls.",
      "Some letters are already clearly visible in the ancient text and the team believes it's a work of philosophy.",
      "Hundreds of carbonised scrolls were discovered in Herculaneum, which like its neighbour Pompeii was buried beneath metres of volcanic ash.",
      "In the past, some of the documents, which are made from a thick paper-like material called papyrus, were prised open but they crumbled into pieces.",
      "The University of Oxford's Bodleian Library holds several of the scrolls. Thought to be unreadable, they had been left untouched for decades.",
      "\"We've never been convinced before that any of the techniques would be safe enough or effective enough to get any information from the scrolls,\" explained Nicole Gilroy, head of book conservation.",
      "But the promise of a hi-tech solution prompted the team to get one of the precious scrolls out of storage.",
      "It was placed in a specially made case and taken to Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire.",
      "Inside this huge machine, which is called a synchrotron, electrons are accelerated to almost the speed of light to produce a powerful X-ray beam that can probe the scroll without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimetre,\" explained Adrian Mancuso, director of physical sciences at Diamond.",
      "The scan is used to create a 3D reconstruction, then the layers inside the scroll - it contains about 10m of papyrus - have to be identified.",
      "\"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally,\" said Dr Mancuso.",
      "After that artificial intelligence is used to detect the ink. It's easier said than done - both the papyrus and ink are made from carbon and they're almost indistinguishable from each other.",
      "So the AI hunts for the tiniest signals that ink might be there, then this ink is painted on digitally, bringing the letters to light.",
      "\"We can tell the entire scroll is full of text,\" said Stephen Parsons.",
      "\"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",
      "Last year, a Vesuvius Challenge team managed to read about 5% of another Herculaneum scroll.",
      "Its subject was Greek Epicurean philosophy, which teaches that fulfilment can be found through the pleasure of everyday things.",
      "The Bodleian's scroll is likely to be on the same subject - but the Vesuvius team is calling for more human and computing ingenuity to see if this is the case.",
      "For Nicole Gilroy, the work is providing a link to the past.",
      "\"I just love that connection with whoever collected them, whoever wrote them, whoever rolled those scrolls up and put them on the shelves. There's a real human aspect to it that I just think is really precious,\" she said.",

      "Local artisans, residents and representatives of all of Mosul's religious communities were also there.",
      "In 2014, IS occupied Mosul, which for centuries was seen as a symbol of tolerance and co-existence between different religious and ethnic communities in Iraq.",
      "The group imposed its extreme ideology on the city, targeting minorities and killing opponents.",
      "Three years later, a US-backed coalition in alliance with the Iraqi army and state-linked militias mounted an intense ground and air offensive to wrest the city back from IS control. The bloodiest battles focused on the Old City, where the group's fighters made a last stand.",

      "\"It was not the city that we knew - it was like a metamorphosis - that we never imagined not even in our worst nightmares. I fell silent after that for a couple of days. I lost my voice. I lost my mind.\"",
      "Eighty per cent of the Old City of Mosul, on the west bank of the Tigris, was destroyed during IS's three-year occupation.",
      "It was not just the churches, mosques and old houses that needed to be repaired, but also the community spirit of those who had lived there for so long in relative harmony between religions and ethnicities.",
      "The huge task of rebuilding began under the auspices of Unesco with a budget of $115m (\u00a393m) that the agency had managed to drum up, much of it from the United Arab Emirates and the European Union.",
      "Father Olivier Poquillon - a Dominican priest - returned to Mosul to help oversee the restoration of one of the key buildings, the convent of Notre-Dame de l'Heure, known locally as al-Saa'a, which was founded nearly 200 years ago.",
      "\"We started by trying first to gather the team - a team composed of people from Old Mosul from different denominations - Christians, Muslims working all together,\" he says.",
      "Father Poquillon says that bringing the communities together was the biggest challenge and the biggest achievement.",
      "\"If you want to rebuild the buildings you've got first to rebuild trust - if you don't rebuild trust, it's useless to reconstruct the walls of those buildings because they will become a target for other communities.\"",
      "In charge of the entire project - which included the restoration of 124 old houses and two especially fine mansions - has been the chief architect Maria Rita Acetoso, who came to Mosul straight from restoration work for Unesco in Afghanistan.",
      "\"This project demonstrates that culture too can create jobs, can encourage skills development and in addition can make those involved feel part of something meaningful,\" she says.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 00:00:20 GMT",
    "summary": "The African nation exports its cashews in raw form, but processing them would be more lucrative.",
    "story": [
      "The Accra street vendor looks at me, bemused.",
      "I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p).",
      "That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up.",
      "The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer.",
      "\"It's incredible,\" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning.",
      "The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy.",
      "Cashing in on Ghana's cashews",
      "Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second.",
      "To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews.",
      "Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them.",
      "He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult.",
      "\"We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,\" he says. \"I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry.\"",
      "He tells me that he currently gets around $50 for a large 100kg sack of unshelled cashews.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. \"Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne.\"",
      "As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews.",
      "Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year.",
      "Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana.",
      "\"If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,\" she complains. \"As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies.\"",
      "She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs.",
      "It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself.",
      "Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders.",
      "Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer.",
      "More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms.",
      "But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies.",
      "\"In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,\" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. \"You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class\".",
      "Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses.",
      "Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews.",
      "\"These firms are dealing with workforces that aren't properly skilled, they have infrastructures that aren't working, they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials, or rule changes, and also it's very difficult to reach foreign markets, he says. \"They need the foreign market because the domestic market is small, and their own government has very little capacity [to boost it].\"",
      "He also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation.",
      "But Mr Simons reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves, to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews. As it is, he says, many of the country's most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive.",
      "\"There's a massive brain drain,\" he says. \"My theory of why Africa's economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side, but the real beauty is in demand, creating a consuming class of cashew-eating enthusiasts, and you don't have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation.\"",
      "He says the same argument applies to Ghana's other bigger exports, like gold and chocolate, neither of which gets much value-addition within Ghana before getting exported to the West.",
      "Mildred Akotia hopes she might be one of those entrepreneurs to buck the trend. She now wants to build her own logistics arm, to be able to process the cashews direct from the farm gate.",
      "\"I have a lot of calls from the UAE, from Canada and America. Currently we can't meet demand. We can't get enough kernels to roast.",
      "\"There's a ready market both locally and internationally. My branding is good, my marketing is good. My dream is to give a facelift to Ghanaian processed foods.\"",

      "As he prepares to set off on another rescue mission on Ukraine's eastern front, 35-year-old Anton Yaremchuk is grateful for the fog. It will shield him and his colleague Pylyp from Russian drones hunting from the skies. His armoured van will provide more protection \u2013 but only up to a point. Every journey could be the last.",
      "In December shrapnel from a drone attack ripped through a clearly marked armoured vehicle used by his team, causing injuries but no deaths.",
      "\"We were extremely lucky,\" he says.",

      "Russian forces are closing in \u2013 they are now less than 2km (1.2 miles) away.",
      "\"The last few days we were coming in, there was hell,\" Anton tells us. \"There are around 7,000 people still there. We'll try to get some people out of that nightmare.\"",
      "He's been doing just that since Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "With his country under attack, the Ukrainian cinematographer left his life and career in Berlin, came home and co-founded a small aid organisation, Base UA. Since then, he and his team have managed to get about 3,000 civilians out of harm's way, taking them away from front lines to safer areas.",
      "Pokrovsk used to be one of those places.",
      "\"It's crazy,\" he says as we head for the city, \"because this used to be the haven, the safest city in the region and the biggest hospital. The evacuation train was departing from Pokrovsk.\"",
      "If and when Russian forces take the city, it will deprive the Ukrainian military of a key supply and transport hub.",
      "Ukraine has already lost the output from a crucial coal mine in the area \u2013 the only one producing coking coal for its steel industry. Operations were suspended last month because of the Russian advance.",
      "We join Anton for the journey to Pokrovsk. He has a tourniquet, and a separate medical kit attached to the front of his body armour. His white high-visibility jacket bears the slogan \"leave no-one behind\".",
      "Before we set off, there's a warning. \"When we park, get out of the vehicles and don't stand nearby,\" Anton tells us, \"in case they are targeted.\"",
      "The closer we get the more explosions we hear. War has left its mark, draining the city of life. Streets are deserted, and houses boarded up. Some buildings have been flattened. There's no smoke from the chimneys on snow-capped rooves. We pass a parked car with a white flag.",
      "But we find Olga, already waiting by the roadside, wrapped up in a lilac winter coat and furry hood. She's one of six people on Anton's list for evacuation this time.",
      "She goes to lock up her home - moving quickly despite her 71 years. And then she gets into the van and does not look back.",
      "\"I have been in this house for 65 years,\" Olga says.",
      "\"It's hard to leave everything behind. But it's not life any more, it's like hell. In the beginning we thought maybe we will sit it out, but now the ground is shaking.\"",
      "Her children and grandchildren have already fled the bombing. I ask if she thinks she will be able to come back one day. \"Who knows,\" she replies, \"but we hope.\"",
      "Along the way, whenever Anton spots people out on the street \u2013 and there aren't many - he urges them to go. He stops the car to hand out leaflets explaining that evacuation is free, and help, including a place to stay and ongoing payments, is available in the city of Pavlohrad to the west. But some are hard to persuade.",
      "\"I have to stay,\" one elderly woman says. \"My son has died, and I need to be near his grave.\"",
      "\"I don't think he would want this,\" Anton says.",
      "We drive on and pass a group of three who have been out collecting water. Anton shouts another warning. \"There will be street battles,\" he says, \"unfortunately, I promise you this. I am doing this from the very first day. It's the same everywhere. This is the final stage.\"",
      "One of the women comes forward to take a leaflet. \"God keep you safe,\" she tells him before going on her way.",
      "Anton moves fast from address to address. When there's no answer at one house, he climbs over a high metal gate to investigate. He knocks. He shouts. He speaks to a neighbour. With no sign of the woman he hoped to evacuate, we drive on.",
      "I ask what he's expecting for 2025, now President Trump is back in the White House and pushing for peace talks.",
      "\"I stopped looking too much ahead,\" he says. \"I think nobody really knows what's going to happen. I personally don't think that even if some kind of negotiations will start, they will bring a ceasefire anytime soon.\"",
      "More than this he expects fighting will worsen if talks do start, as both sides will try to gain leverage.",
      "The last pick up of the day is 75-year-old Lyuba \u2013 her white hair peeping out from under a scarf. Her long life is now compressed into a few plastic bags. She looks bereft and flinches at every explosion we hear.",
      "\"It has been bad,\" she tells me. \"Bad. We were left alone. There are no authorities. People are just getting killed under the sky,\" she says, gesturing upwards. \"There's no gas, no water, no electricity.\"",
      "Lyuba is helped into the van, which is now full, with five elderly evacuees \u2013 their memories and their fears - and one black cat peering out from a pet carrier. No-one speaks.",
      "For Anton this is a familiar picture, but still a painful one.",
      "We first travelled with him in the heat of summer in 2022. He was then evacuating civilians from another front-line city \u2013 Lysychansk - as Russian shells rained down.",
      "Now in Ukraine's third winter of war he \u2013 and other volunteers \u2013 are still trying to outrun moving front lines and save whoever they can.",
      "\"To be honest every time I see this I break down,\" he says, \"because it's just these innocent people leaving everything behind. These are human tragedies, and you can never really get used to it. But I am glad that we manage to get people out to safety.\"",
      "That comes at a cost, and it is increasing.",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "She was the archetypal Sixties rock chick; a pop star at 17; Mick Jagger's muse at 19; and by 24, a junkie on the streets. But Marianne Faithfull (Dec. 29, 1946-Jan. 30, 2025), who burst out of the '60s British Invasion with the hit \"As Tears Go By,\" launched a second act in the late 1970s. Her lithe voice, later weathered from surviving sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, was brought forth in such albums as \"Broken English,\" \"Dangerous Acquaintances,\" and \"Easy Come, Easy Go.\"",
      "The daughter of an eccentric British professor and an Austrian baroness, Faithfull was just out of convent school, and was performing as a folk singer, when she was discovered at a party by the manager of the Rolling Stones. Jagger and Keith Richards wrote her breakthrough hit, \"As Tears Go By.\"",
      "Just as her career exploded, at 18, she married a London art dealer and had a baby. \"I was very overenthusiastically eager for life,\" she told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2009. \"I wanted to just bite into it and swallow it whole.\"",
      "She then left her marriage for Jagger. They became one of Swinging London's most photographed couples. Then, in February 1967, British police barged into a Rolling Stones party at Richards' home. The police found drugs, and Marianne naked in a fur rug. Though charges were later dropped, Faithfull's image was disgraced. She felt she'd let her parents down: \"I think that's the worst feeling in the world,\" she told Anthony Mason.",
      "She played up the \"bad girl\" image by acting in the film \"Girl on a Motorcycle.\" But she miscarried Jagger's child after eight months, and while on a trip to Australia with Jagger, she swallowed 150 sleeping pills. She spent six days in a coma. Faithfull recovered, but her relationship with Jagger did not.",
      "She fell into heroin addiction. She said, \"It's certainly not what I was dreaming of when I was eight or ten \u2013 I'm going to grow up and become a junkie and live on the street!\" she said. She would lose custody of her son, Nicholas, and the damage began to show in her singing voice. But in 1979, she pulled herself together to release a raw and daring comeback album, \"Broken English.\" \"I became myself,\" she said, \"and it was not a person people thought I was. It was more intelligent, stronger, ravaged in its own way, but very quite interesting.\"",
      "It would be several more years before she freed herself of addiction, and in 2008 recorded \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" with Sean Lennon, Rufus Wainwright, Nick Cave, Cat Power, and Keith Richards. She also returned to acting, in \"Paris, Je T'aime,\" \"Marie Antoinette,\" and \"Faces in the Crowd.\"",
      "Faithfull said she appreciated the long, hard road she'd traveled: \"I think I've been very unconscious for a long time, and only now have I begun to get it. As long as I got it before I croaked, I think that's the main thing.\""

    "summary": "The actor-writer-director's latest film, a poignant comic-drama costarring Kieran Culkin, earned him an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. But Jesse Eisenberg finds it difficult to not feel miserable.",
    "story": [
      "We'll tell you up front: Actor-director Jesse Eisenberg, who says he can appreciate a good Jewish deli, is a different kind of movie star. We joined him last week at the legendary Canter's Deli in Los Angeles, and shared some chocolate babka, with a dill pickle chaser. \"This is the real test,\" Eisenberg said.",
      "It was a little unusual, but for Eisenberg, it'd already been a pretty unusual day. Just a few hours earlier, he received his second Oscar nomination, this time for best original screenplay.",
      "And he was mortified.",
      "I asked, \"Are you able to enjoy moments like this?\"",
      "\"No, I'm not really wired to enjoy praise,\" he replied. \"I don't know why. I think it just, like, I don't know, triggers some guilt response in my brain and I try to find something to be miserable about. But I'll tell you what I do love: I love actually doing my job. Like, I feel so lucky that I found something I like to do.\"",
      "At the moment, his job is to promote the film he wrote, directed and starred in, \"A Real Pain,\" co-starring Kieran Culkin. The film is about two cousins who travel to Poland to see their ancestral home, and visit the actual home of their late grandmother, who barely survived the Holocaust.",
      "The film started out as a buddy movie about a trip to Mongolia. As he was writing the script, Eisenberg got stuck, until inspiration literally popped up on his computer. \"I was, like, 30 pages into the script and something was missing,\" he said. \"I knew the script was not going well. And so, I'm, like, kind of, like, banging my head against the keyboard. And an ad pops up online for 'Auschwitz tours.' And then in parentheses, 'with lunch.' And I was like, 'Auschwitz tours (with lunch)?' That's, like, the strangest pairing of four words I've ever seen. And once I saw that, and once I read that brochure, I was like, 'Oh, that's the movie. That is so interesting,' because I was trying to deal with these two characters who are both kind of, like, in pain in their own ways.\"",
      "\"Dude, we are Jews on a train in Poland, ******* think about it. \u2026 Does no one else see the irony here? Like, eating fancy food and sitting up here, when 80 years ago we would've been herded into the backs of these ******* things like cattle?\"",
      "Watch a scene with Jesse Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin in \"A Real Pain\" [Warning: Graphic language]",
      "Eisenberg has had those same thoughts. He is himself of Polish lineage, and he has relatives who were victims of the Holocaust. \"I come from a family who survived the war; a lot of, you know, cousins, aunts, and uncles who didn't,\" he said. \"And yet, I walk around New York City, like, kind of miserable. Like, I'm not, like, a happy person. I'm not asking for pity or anything; I'm just recognizing objectively, like, I'm not a happy person. And yet, I come from people who survived through miracles. Intellectually, I think I should be waking up every morning kissing the dirt that I'm here by virtue of a thousand miracles. And instead, I walk around, I'm like, Oh my God. What am I gonna do today? Oh my God. I shouldn't drink a coffee 'cause then I'll peak at noon.",
      "\"And so, I'm constantly trying to reconcile my fortunate life with how I feel about things, and my forebears' very unfortunate lives and how they appreciated things. And that's what this movie is kind of focusing on.\"",
      "It seems he's been feeling that same kind of anxiety all of his life. Raised in New Jersey, Jesse Eisenberg was, by his own admission, a \"sad kid\" who was uncomfortable at school, and took refuge in acting. By 2010 he'd made a name for himself in Hollywood, with roles like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in \"The Social Network.\" The part earned him an Oscar nod, and the juice to branch out into writing and directing.",
      "But when COVID shut down the film industry in 2020, Eisenberg and his wife, Anna Strout, moved back to her native Indiana, and spent their days volunteering at her mom's domestic violence shelter in Bloomington. \"I was just volunteering every day at the shelter,\" he said. \"It sounds weird to say this, and I don't mean this for any kind of \u2013 it was, like, the happiest time of my life. I was painting walls and fixing garbage disposals. And I just loved it so much. I loved being able to, like, accomplish something where there was no, like, critique of it, you know what I mean?\"",
      "\"It makes total sense,\" I said. \"You fix the garbage disposal, the garbage disposal's fixed. End of it.\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "But of all the roles he's played, on-screen and off-, he says the confident illusionist in the \"Now You See Me\" franchise is the most challenging, because it's absolutely nothing like him. \"We just did the third 'Now You See Me,' and it's such a blast,\" he said. \"And it's such a challenge, because I'm doing something that's, like, the exact opposite of my psychology. It's the only time I ever walk away thinking, 'I did a good job today.' But that's because my character thinks that they're doing well. And yes, they're Hollywood movies, and they're really fun. But, like, for me, it's been a kind of like a therapy.\"",
      "\"Does that confidence linger at all past the shoots?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, normally it will linger through dinner,\" he replied. \"Once I get on set and I'm in those clothes, and I'm speaking in the way they've written for me \u2026 I stand up straighter. I'm, like, an inch taller. It's amazing. I can make eye contact with my father!\"",
      "You'd think the success of \"A Real Pain\" would give Eisenberg some swagger. His movie also snagged Culkin an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. But like the babka and pickles at Canter's, Eisenberg can't seem to enjoy the sweet without just a little bit of sour.",
      "I asked, \"Is there a part of you that finds this whole experience, with the way that 'A Real Pain' has been received, kind of unreal? That at some moment you're gonna wake up?\"",
      "\"Oh, yeah, I assume a piano is gonna fall on my head every day,\" Eisenberg said. \"Because I feel like, I am so lucky. And, like, the way my mind does equations is that this lucky thing must mean this horrible upcoming thing. And so, yes, I'm not walking under any air conditioners in New York City. I don't know how to think about it any other way. And that's really unfortunate, but true!\"",

    "summary": "A giant in the music and entertainment industry, the trailblazing record executive helped Motown find such talent as The Jackson 5, The Commodores, and Rick James. And at 78, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee is still listening for new stories to tell.",
    "story": [
      "Like many homes, Suzanne de Passe's is filled with stuff. Her version of stuff? Gold and platinum albums. Snapshots with Stevie Wonder and a young Michael Jackson. The Oscar-nominated screenplay she co-wrote for \"Lady Sings the Blues.\" Her 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Award.",
      "De Passe is a giant in the music and entertainment industry \u2026 a trailblazing executive who moved Motown from Hitsville to Hollywood. She did it with raw talent and relentless determination.",
      "\"I had so many wonderful things to do,\" she said, \"and they were all hard, and they were all new \u2013 learning; making mistakes; getting my butt kicked; crying (tears of frustration, not sadness) \u2013 and little by little, I got my legs up under me.\"",
      "Born in Harlem and nurtured in the historic Black community of Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, de Passe says a supportive family gave her the tools to succeed.",
      "I asked, \"What were the lessons you learned from them?\"",
      "\"I think more than lessons, it was values,\" she replied.",
      "By 19, she left college to book performers at the Cheetah Club in Manhattan. Her friend, Cindy Birdsong, had just joined The Supremes, and introduced de Passe to her boss, Motown founder Berry Gordy, who hired de Passe as his creative assistant.",
      "\"When he decided that I should come to the company, I asked for a contract,\" she recalled. \"He said, 'I don't do contracts.' And I was there for 21 years without one, on a handshake.\"",
      "Part of her job was to find new talent, and that's what she did, when de Passe first heard about a group of brothers from Gary, Indiana. They called themselves The Jackson 5.",
      "\"The hair on the back of my neck stood up. They were great,\" she said.",
      "\"The hair literally stood up?\"",
      "\"Yeah, the hair. This is my big barometer, back there, absolutely. When you feel something, it's not intellectual, at all. I said, 'Oh, my gosh, Mr. Gordy, I saw this great act.' He said, 'Great.' I said, 'Wait till you see these kids.' He said, 'Kids? I don't want any kid acts. Are you crazy?'\"",
      "She wasn't. And Motown introduced The Jackson 5 to the world.",
      "de Passe took them to the dentist, worked on their early dance moves, and even picked out their wardrobe. She found Michael Jackson's hat on 8th Street in Greenwich Village. \"It was iconic, but nobody knew it at the time,\" she said.",
      "In the 1970s, she was discovering and developing artists for Motown in L.A., signing The Commodores, De Barge, and Rick James. \"I feel like I'm lucky to be alive,\" she laughed. Why? \"Because Rick was bigger than life. He was a great consumer of drugs, and just a brilliant, brilliant artist.\"",
      "It is a notorious business, and difficult to navigate, especially back then, especially for her.",
      "I asked, \"You weren't just a woman, you were a Black woman. Are you saying you faced, like, things coming at you, sexism, racism?\"",
      "\"I have had every 'ism' to deal with,\" said de Passe. \"Sexism, racism, pessimism, optimism, you know? And what I've found is that the moment you let yourself be defined by your 'isms' is when you've lost.\"",
      "de Passe always persevered. She was also a good persuader, convincing Diana Ross that the song \"I'm Coming Out\" would be a smash hit. Ross' first reaction, said de Passe, was, \"in very blatant terms, 'I hate these songs.' But I felt it would be [a hit]. Nobody knows. That's the thing about it. Nobody knows.\"",
      "\"But clearly you have really good sixth sense?\" I asked.",
      "\"I believe in what I believe in,\" de Passe replied. \"And some of it works and some of it doesn't. But I'm happy to say I have a good percentage.\"",
      "In 1982, de Passe was made president of Motown Productions. One of her first big projects was the TV special \"Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever.\" Nearly 50 million people watched Michael Jackson do the moonwalk. \"Oh, my God. and it was only six seconds,\" said de Passe. \"But the whole 'Billy Jean' of it all was just magic, I think, because nobody had ever seen anything like that before.\"",
      "de Passe also produced the landmark miniseries \"Lonesome Dove.\"",
      "I said, \"A lot of people would ask, 'What does Motown know about westerns?'\"",
      "\"Probably nothing; but I did,\" de Passe replied. \"I think the death of art is that you have to be gay to play gay. I think the death of art is that you have to be Black to direct or write a Black movie. The death of art is to not have the best person do what it is they are well-suited and passionate to do, regardless of all that other exterior stuff. And I am sick of it.\"",
      "At 78, she is still listening to her ear (and gut), finding new opportunities and stories to tell. And, with her induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Suzanne de Passe is recognized as a true pioneer.",
      "\"I am so grateful to have had that moment to really feel that energy coming back to me,\" she said. \"I will also say, I have worked really, really hard.\"",
      "\"For someone who worked behind the scenes and in the shadows, you felt seen?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh, definitely. I felt very seen, and very blessed.\"",

    "title": "Making time for Christian Marclay's \"The Clock\"",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 09:25:23 -0500",
    "summary": "The multimedia artist talks about his cinematic timepiece, a 24-hour film comprised of scenes from movies and TV that track the viewer's own experience of time, minute by minute, currently screening at New York's Museum of Modern Art.",
    "story": [
      "From time to time, you might notice a shot of a clock in a movie. In a film like \"Back to the Future,\" they're key to the plot; lightning strikes the clock tower at exactly 10:04 p.m. But often, clocks are just ticking away in the background, or not ticking at all, like the watch from \"Pulp Fiction,\" stopped at 11:46.",
      "Compile enough of these seemingly minute details, and minutes can turn into hours, spanning decades of moving-image history. That is the case with artist Christian Marclay's \"The Clock,\" a 24-hour film comprised entirely of clips from movies and television.",
      "\"It's not to create a trick or to make you forget about time,\" Marclay said. \"I want you to be totally conscious about it throughout.\"",
      "Currently on view at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, \"The Clock\" runs on a continuous loop, synced to the precise time of day. When the kids in \"The Breakfast Club\" are whistling at 11:31 a.m., it's 11:31 in real life. An hour later, \"Rain Man\" announces \"Oh, it's 12:31.\" Minute by minute, the footage functions as an actual clock.",
      "Stuart Comer, the chief curator of media and performance at MoMA, calls watching Maclay's mash-up an uncanny experience. \"[You're] watching some of your favorite movies and realizing that it's telling the time that you're living in right now,\" Comer said. \"It's eliminating that barrier between you and the world on-screen.",
      "\"The effort that it took with Christian and the team of researchers locating 'The Clock' footage and all of these different clips is somewhat superhuman,\" he said.",
      "When Marclay won best artist for \"The Clock\" at the 2011 Venice Biennale, it turned him into a contemporary art superstar. But the 70-year-old first made a name for himself decades earlier as part of New York's underground DJ scene. \"In those days, you would find records \u2026 people would put them in their trash,\" he said.",
      "Born to an American mother and Swiss father, Marclay was raised in Switzerland and moved to the U.S. to attend art school in the late 1970s. \"I kept putting aside my work as a visual artist, 'cause I lived in a tiny East Village apartment, and I didn't have a studio,\" he said. \"So, music at that time was convenient.\"",
      "It was, he admitted, easier to store records than canvases. \"But you need tolerant neighbors!\" he laughed.",
      "Marclay's music was experimental. He was an early pioneer of \"turntablism,\" invited to spin on the short-lived show \"Night Music.\" \"I would destroy the records in performance, but then I had all these incredible covers, such an interesting history of graphic design. And I started collaging with them.\"",
      "One of Marclay's early successes in the visual art world arrived via his Body Mix series, in which he physically stitched together album covers to create new forms.",
      "He's unspooled cassette tapes to make prints and pillows. He's cut up everything from Japanese manga to movie subtitles, stacking cinematic fragments nearly 20 feet tall. He said he felt more comfortable as a collagist: \"I'm more interested in working with what exists rather than [to], you know, invent or draw something,\" he said.",
      "In 1995, Marclay created \"Telephones,\" a masterful mashup of film phone conversations.",
      "It's been more than a decade since \"The Clock\" was last in New York. Marclay is extremely precise about where and how it can be screened, insisting that any museum showing the work stay open at least once for 24 hours so audiences can see the nighttime section.",
      "Are there \"Clock\" completists? \"Oh, there are definitely 'Clock' squatters, I would say \u2013     people who really commit to watching it!\" Comer laughed.",
      "But Marclay insists the point isn't to see all of it; it's more to make you hyper-aware of the time you're spending literally watching a clock. \"Here, you're reminded that you have an appointment at a certain time, that you can't spend your whole day watching this thing,\" Marclay said. \"You're more than a viewer. You're a participant in a way, because your life infringes on this clock.\"",

    "summary": "Americans are among those exposed to the virus in Uganda.",
    "story": [
      "Some health officials in the U.S. fear the shutdown of U.S. Agency for International Development missions may have disastrous results, as the stalling of foreign aid has forced delays in what they said was the \"chaotic\" early U.S. response to Uganda's swelling\u00a0Ebola outbreak.",
      "The outbreak marks Uganda's eighth from an Ebola virus. The first confirmed case in the outbreak was a nurse at a hospital in the nation's capital, Kampala, who contracted Ebola on Jan. 20 or Jan. 21 and died on Jan. 29.",
      "There are now six confirmed and six suspect cases. In two of the suspect cases, according to an internal slide shared with CBS News, health authorities have identified no epidemiological link to the other cases.",
      "More than a dozen Americans in Uganda are also among those so far known to have been exposed to Sudan virus, the type of Ebola that had infected the initial case. Those people so far have not shown symptoms, two people familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "There is no vaccine or treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration for Sudan virus. This Ebola strain has been fatal in at least 41% of reported cases during past outbreaks, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "The new outbreak coincides with the Trump administration's pause in foreign aid \u2014 including its response to international outbreaks that could spread. This has spawned uncertainty among health nonprofits, which now face unpaid debts and a sweeping freeze on much of their U.S. funding.",
      "\"What we're talking about are disaster relief workers, we're talking about health workers and people who are doing good and protecting America around the world,\" Dr. Atul Gawande, a former USAID global health director, told CBS News on Monday.",
      "The pause has resulted in understaffed contact tracing and screening of departing international travelers in Uganda, one U.S. official said, since many experts funded by the U.S. around the region have been laid off or ordered to stop work.",
      "USAID is set to put virtually all its staff on leave this Friday and is shutting down overseas missions.",
      "\"It puts the world at risk,\" said one USAID official in a message. \"I'm not an alarmist, but this is very bad,\" the official added.",
      "In 2022, an outbreak of Sudan virus in Uganda prompted a large American response. The U.S.\u00a0ramped up\u00a0screening and preparedness for the virus here and sent\u00a0staff and resources\u00a0to aid Uganda's efforts to contain its spread.",
      "Uganda's healthcare system had already been stretched thin in recent months, battling a separate outbreak of a different disease \u2013 mpox \u2013 that has resulted in at least 2,031 cases, according to the WHO.",
      "Spokespeople for the State Department and USAID did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "President Trump has also ordered the U.S. withdrawal from the WHO, which was paired with a demand for all U.S. government staff to immediately sever collaboration with the U.N. agency that is helping to coordinate the response within the country.",
      "A U.S. health official said that CDC usually works closely with the WHO and a country's health authorities, often meeting daily to coordinate the response to outbreaks like this.",
      "Despite the president's order regarding WHO, \"CDC has been cleared to speak one-on-one with WHO counterparts related to response activities in Uganda,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement. The CDC said such conversations are also allowed regarding responses to other outbreaks of concern in Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "Attempts by U.S. agencies to deploy staff to aid the outbreak response have also been delayed, one official said, amid government-wide pauses to travel and spending.",
      "More than 100 staff are currently working in the CDC's office in Uganda, a U.S. official said. Agency staff are also currently embedded within Uganda's response team. An additional team of CDC experts is expected to deploy to the country this weekend, another health official said.",
      "While officials secured a waiver on Saturday from the State Department to free up some funds for the Ebola response, many recipients of U.S. funds have been reluctant to accept the money because of the turmoil in Washington, two people familiar with the situation said.",
      "Nonprofits have also been grappling with a growing number of demands imposed by the Trump administration as a condition for receiving funds, like a sweeping order to purge all mentions of gender and diversity \"at every level and activity, regardless of your location or the citizenship of employees or contractors\" supported by U.S. dollars.",
      "In Uganda, groups are still waiting for clarification from their in-country contacts at USAID about how the waiver would apply to their work, the people said, wary of incurring more expenses that might never be repaid.",
      "Following Mr. Trump's executive orders, the country's health ministry urged all staff backed by CDC and USAID to \"continue working in the spirit of patriotism as volunteers,\" in a letter obtained by CBS News, as Ugandan officials sought \"to restore normalcy.\"",
      "\"Radio silence\" from the CDC",
      "The growing outbreak in Uganda has also left some state and local health authorities befuddled with the \"radio silence\" from the CDC, officials told CBS News.",
      "In past outbreaks, CDC officials were quick to start ramping up preparedness for the possibility of cases spreading to the U.S.",
      "External meetings and information sharing that health authorities usually rely on to communicate with CDC officials were canceled amid the communications \"pause\" across the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS.",
      "An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The communications pause was initially expected to end this past weekend, but many federal health officials say they're still facing delays or denials in getting approval to publish information or participate in external meetings.",
      "\"HHS continues to increase staff levels as we look forward to the new Secretary leading the agency. HHS has approved numerous communications related to critical health and safety needs and will continue to do so,\" Andrew Nixon, the department's communications director, told CBS News in an earlier statement.",
      "As a stopgap, some states have been working on informal partnerships to ramp up their own preparedness for the arrival of potential cases, officials said.",
      "The CDC was able to publish a travel alert on Wednesday about travel to Uganda, but it left out links and information from the WHO's updates about the outbreak.",
      "Other donors stepping in",
      "Not all health experts are alarmed about the current situation.",
      "Two U.S. infectious disease physicians who have worked with outbreaks in the country expressed confidence that other groups and countries would be able to fill the void left by American support, but acknowledged they're concerned about the possibility of undetected spread and delays in the response.",
      "In past outbreaks of Ebola, the U.S. has often funded many of the key steps to contain the outbreak in its earliest days, including rushing to set up isolation facilities and support the outbreak response from an array of non-governmental organizations with workers in the country.",
      "U.S.-funded laboratories have usually been on the front lines of past responses to outbreaks, through institutions like the Uganda Virus Research Institute.",
      "Some groups, like M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and the WHO, have tried to cover the shortfall. The WHO recently touted its launch \u2014 with the help of Canada and Europe \u2014 of a vaccination trial in response to the outbreak.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 20:38:02 -0500",
    "summary": "The strain, called D1.1, was behind a human death from bird flu last year.",
    "story": [
      "At least four cattle herds in Nevada have tested positive for a strain of H5N1 bird flu never before seen in cows, state agriculture officials confirmed Wednesday, and respiratory symptoms like coughing and sneezing have been reported.",
      "That bird flu strain, called D1.1 by scientists, was also linked to a fatal human case in Louisiana last year after exposure to sick birds. The D1.1 strain has emerged in recent months to dominate infections in wild birds and poultry flocks across North America.",
      "Symptoms seen in humans infected by D1.1 have been more severe than the previous bird flu strain that has been spreading in cows. That strain, called B3.13, has led to only mild symptoms, like pink eye and fever, in humans infected after contact with sick cows.",
      "Research suggests that B3.13 is less likely to result in severe disease for humans, unlike other bird flu strains overseas. The risk is different for other animals, like pet cats, which have frequently died after exposure to food and milk contaminated with B3.13.",
      "The discovery of the D1.1 bird flu strain's spread in cows also upends previous theories floated by U.S. health and agriculture officials that the spillover of the virus into cows from wild birds was a rare, one-off event.",
      "All cases of bird flu in cows since a spillover in Texas in late 2023 had previously been linked only to B3.13, which officials have cited as evidence that new variants of the virus were not repeatedly spreading into cows from birds.",
      "\"The detection does not change USDA's HPAI eradication strategy,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said Wednesday, citing the federal government's plan to try to stop the unprecedented surge of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, in recent years.",
      "In addition to the human health threat posed by the virus, an unprecedented toll claimed by spillovers of the D1.1 from wild birds into chickens has driven up egg prices across the country.",
      "Nearly a thousand cow herds have been confirmed infected by bird flu to date, the USDA says, with detections across 16 states. Most recent cases have been in California.",
      "The four new cattle herds infected by D1.1 were reported in Nevada's Churchill County, a spokesperson for the state's Agriculture Department said.",
      "Bird flu was also reported in December from a herd in the state's Nye County, though those cows ended up testing positive for the B3.13 strain of the virus.",
      "The Nevada spokesperson said two additional herds in Churchill County have also now been placed under quarantine, pending laboratory results from the USDA.",
      "\"Symptoms of H5N1 D1.1 have been similar to the detections of B3.13. These include fever, reduced feed consumption, reduced milk production and mild respiratory signs (coughing, sneezing, runny nose),\" Ciara Ressel, Nevada Agriculture Department spokesperson, said of the cows' symptoms.",
      "Those herds were confirmed to have been infected as the result of a state investigation, the USDA said, after a silo that had received milk from the cows tested positive for the virus.",
      "\"USDA APHIS continues to work with the Nevada Department of Agriculture by conducting additional on-farm investigation, testing, and gathering additional epidemiological information to better understand this detection and limit further disease spread,\" the USDA said.",
      "It is unclear how many workers in the state may have been exposed to the D1.1 strain after working with those sick cows.",
      "A spokesperson for Nevada's health department referred a request to the Central Nevada Health District, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that 40 out of the 67 confirmed human bird flu cases since 2024 have been linked to exposure to dairy cows sick with the virus. Most of the others have been the result of exposure to infected poultry.",
      "In a news release last month, Nevada's Agriculture Department said the CDC \"maintains that the risk to humans remains low,\" and that it was \"working with state and county health officials to protect human health and safety.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment when asked if D1.1's spillover changes that risk assessment.",
      "\"It is critical that animal health biosecurity practices are enhanced to help prevent the spread of disease and protect animal and worker safety,\" state veterinarian Peter Rolfe said.",

      "The actual count of people who get sick from eating food is unknown and likely far higher than official tallies, as only a small percentage of illnesses related to contaminated food is diagnosed and reported to public health officials. For every case of salmonella detected through a lab test, for example, 29 illnesses are caused by the bacteria, the CDC estimates.",
      "Last year, separate salmonella outbreaks linked to cucumbers and eggs sickened more than 200 people in dozens of states, while listeria outbreaks linked to ready-to-eat meat and poultry products sickened 19, hospitalized 17 and killed two. An outbreak of E. coli in the fall of 2024 linked to organic carrots sickened 48 people in 19 states, killing one. Another linked to onions served in McDonald's burgers sickened more than 100 people in 14 states, resulting in one death.",

      "Testing New York's shield laws",
      "The indictment could be the first direct test of New York's shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\"Earlier today, a New York doctor was indicted in Louisiana for using telemedicine to prescribe abortion medication to a patient. That's right: a doctor is being prosecuted for providing basic health care to her patient. We always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn't the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That's why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients. It's more critical than ever for states to step up and protect reproductive freedom \u2014 and I'll never back down from this fight,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Hochul signed the bill protecting doctors from out-of-state lawsuits\u00a0in 2023.",
      "\"I will never under any circumstances turn this doctor over to the state of Louisiana under any extradition request,\" Hochul said in a video posted to social media. \"I will do everything I can to protect this doctor and allow her to continue the work that she's doing that is so essential.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, said in a statement:",
      "\"Abortion care is health care. The criminalization of abortion care is a direct and brazen attack on Americans' bodily autonomy and their right to reproductive freedom. This cowardly attempt out of Louisiana to weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American. We will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers' ability to deliver critical care. Medication abortion is safe, effective, and necessary, and New York will ensure that it remains available to all Americans who need it.\"",
      "Legal experts say Carpenter may still face some hurdles.",
      "\"What happens when she tries to renew her medical license and she has a pending felony indictment in Louisiana? What happens to the doctor when she tries to fly somewhere and TSA says, hey, you have an active warrant?\" attorney Franz Borghardt said.",
      "Louisiana classifies abortion pills as \"controlled dangerous substances\"",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They're also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \"controlled dangerous substances.\" The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\"Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we've witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women's rights,\" the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \"It's no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\"",
      "Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency medicine physician in New York, said abortion bans are making it more dangerous for young girls and women.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",
      "Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 10:09:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Unions are suing to halt the Trump administration's \"deferred resignation\" offer, claiming it is against the law and jeopardizes workers.",
    "story": [
      "More than 2 million federal employees face a looming deadline: By midnight Eastern time on Thursday, they must decide whether to accept a \"deferred resignation\" offer from the Trump administration. If workers accept, according to a White House plan, they would continue getting paid through September but would be excused from reporting for duty. But if they opt to keep their jobs, they could get fired.",
      "That decision, one affecting the careers and livelihoods of Americans around the U.S., is fraught, employment attorneys and government watchdogs said. The offer, from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), includes a number of provisions that are unclear and not guaranteed, posing financial and professional risks while leaving workers in danger of not getting what they signed up for, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Trump administration also may lack authority to extend such a deal, and as such the deferred resignation allegedly breaks numerous laws, a Feb. 4 lawsuit filed by several federal employee unions alleges. The plaintiffs in that suit are asking a court to block the government's offer, which they describe as \"arbitrary, capricious\" and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, a 1946 law governing how federal agencies implement regulations.",
      "The deferred resignation offer is the brainchild of the second Trump administration, which has ordered federal workers to return to the office five days a week\u00a0while directing government agencies to end remote work arrangements. The White House expects to persuade up to roughly 10% of the federal civilian workforce to resign, saving $100 billion a year in costs.",
      "So far, about 40,000 federal workers have accepted the deal, or some 2% of the federal workforce, according to a CBS News source familiar with the matter, although that number could rise as the deadline nears.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt on Jan. 28 described the offer as aimed at \"making our government efficient and productive again.\"",
      "\"If [federal workers] don't want to work in the office and contribute to making America great again, then they are free to choose a different line of work, and the Trump Administration will provide a very generous payout of eight months,\" she said.",
      "The offer isn't available to members of the armed forces, U.S. Postal Service workers, and those who work in jobs related to immigration enforcement and national security, according to the OPM.",
      "Risks to workers",
      "OPM's offer includes many gray areas that could present pitfalls to employees who accept it, experts said.",
      "\"There is a risk for employees to take this without knowing what would happen down the line,\" said Ryan Nerney, managing partner at law firm Tully Rinckey and an expert on federal employment law. \"If you decide to take this, and let's say there's a reduction in force and your job is eliminated, there is no guidance on what would happen in a circumstance like that. Would you still get paid through Sept. 30?\"",
      "The agency's email lacks specifics and guarantees about the offer, adding to government workers' confusion, Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very confusing \u2014 it says you won't have to do your position duties anymore, but there is a caveat that says if they need you, you have to keep doing that,\" Greenwald said, referring to the resignation letter that says employees aren't expected to work except in \"rare circumstances.\"",
      "A dozen state attorneys general have also cautioned federal workers about accepting the offer, describing it as \"misleading\" and urging employees to closely scrutinize the terms.",
      "Elon Musk's \"Fork in the Road\"",
      "Federal workers received the Trump administration's offer in an email last month entitled \"A Fork in the Road,\" mirroring the subject line of a 2022 message\u00a0sent by billionaire Elon Musk to employees at Twitter, the social media platform he bought in October 2022 and later renamed X.",
      "Like Twitter's earlier deal, OPM's offer includes a demand that federal workers make a decision by a specific date. In his 2022 email, Musk told Twitter employees they had one day to decide to either agree to work in a \"hardcore\" style or quit and get three months of severance.",
      "Musk is spearheading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task force tasked by President Trump with slashing federal costs. The Tesla CEO has touted the government's deferred resignation offer on X, claiming that employees who accept it can do \"whatever you like, including obtaining a new job\" while receiving government pay and benefits through September.",
      "Although that could strike some workers like a good deal, the unions' lawsuit claims OPM may not have the financial authority to make that offer. For instance, the agency's email states it will pay workers who agree to resign by Feb. 6 through Sept. 30, but funding for most federal agencies expires on March 14.",
      "That indicates the Trump administration is planning to spend money \"before an appropriation is authorized,\" the suit claims. If so, that could violate The Antideficiency Act, a law that prohibits federal agencies from spending above their appropriated levels, the complaint alleges.",
      "The deferred resignation offer allegedly also violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the lawsuit claims. That law says courts can find government agency actions to be unlawful if they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"",
      "It's also not clear what could happen to federal workers who accept the offer if it is then found to be illegal by the courts, said Robert Weissman, co-president of government watchdog group Public Citizen. \"I could imagine going back to work and being told you did not work, and we're not going to pay you for an illegal program,\" he said.",
      "Government employees should \"be skeptical about what is actually going to be delivered through this offer,\" Weissman added.",
      "Impact on federal services?",
      "The offer also fails to consider the impact of widespread resignations on the government's ability to provide services to Americans, the union suit alleges. Twitter (now X) suffered from a number of issues after Musk cut the majority of its workforce, including a decline in advertisers and sharp drop in its valuation, the complaint states.",
      "A sweeping job-cutting measure could cause chaos if government agencies lacked enough staff to handle some services such as tax refund processing, Social Security verification, or providing health care through Medicaid and Medicare, experts say.",
      "\"There is no 10% across-the-board slush fund of employees that [the public] would not feel any harm by this,\" Greenwald said. \"The federal government is not Twitter \u2014 it is funded by Congress and budgeted by that process, and it is set to uphold the laws that Congress has passed.\"",
      "Federal employee unions are also chafing at the OPM's nine-day window for workers to make a decision, with the lawsuit calling it \"an arbitrary date ... selected to put maximum pressure on the federal workforce so that they would accept the offer, in many cases contrary to federal agency and federal employee interests.\"",
      "Giving federal employees just over a week to make a weighty career decision is a departure from previous voluntary resignation offers, with buyouts in the Clinton administration providing one year for workers to accept a deal, the lawsuit points out.",
      "Still, despite the unknowns in OPM's offer, it might make sense for some government workers, such as people who were already planning to retire soon, Nerney said.",

      "DOGE, which isn't a federal department, has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and sparked several lawsuits since Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, with some claiming Musk's DOGE is violating various laws. For instance, two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy group for older people and retirees, sued on Feb. 3 over DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment systems \u2014 which handle everything from tax refunds to Social Security payments \u2014 alleging that the move breaches privacy regulations.",

      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, Leavitt said, \"Elon Musk is a special government employee and has abided by all applicable federal laws.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the \"special government employee\" designation.",
      "What is a special government employee?",
      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone who\"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\" according to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role was created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, according to the publication Government Executive. A special government employee can be paid or unpaid, the Justice Department notes.",
      "Which rules must SGEs adhere to?",
      "SGEs \"are subject to most rules, although sometimes in a less restrictive way,\" including ethics and conflict of interest rules, the Justice Department states.",
      "But SGEs also are prohibited from working on issues that impact their financial interests, as well as their spouses, children or organizations in which they work or serve as a director or trustee. Some of Musk's businesses rely on the federal government's contracts, including SpaceX, which was awarded 100 contracts in 2023 worth $3 billion, according to the New York Times.",
      "Musk's potential conflict of interests were highlighted by Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, in a Jan. 31 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the Tesla CEO's access to the department's payment system.",
      "\"I am concerned Musk's enormous business operations in China \u2014 a country whose intelligence agencies have stolen vast amounts of sensitive data about Americans, including U.S. government employee data by hacking U.S. government systems \u2014 endangers U.S. cybersecurity and creates conflicts of interest that make his access to these systems a national security risk,\" Wyden wrote.",
      "However, an SGE can get a waiver \"if your interest is not large,\" the Justice Department notes. \"If you do not qualify for a waiver, you will have to disqualify yourself from participating in any matter that affects your financial interests.\"",
      "Musk's $418 billion fortune is largely tied up in his stakes in SpaceX, worth $136 billion, and Tesla, valued at $158 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Does Musk need to make disclosures as an SGE?",
      "Special government employees are only required to make a public financial disclosure report if they earn above the GS-15 government pay rate, or about $123,000. If they make below that, they can file on a confidential basis.",
      "It's not clear whether Musk is being paid for his work or if he's participating on a volunteer basis, although DOGE has recruited full-time salaried employees.",

    "story": [
      "Ultra-cheap clothing from China could get more expensive under President Trump's new tariffs, and help Amazon edge out competition from overseas.",
      "An additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods went into effect on Tuesday, the same day President Donald Trump agreed to pause\u00a0 tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days.",
      "In addition to imposing a 10% levy on Chinese imports, Mr. Trump's executive order also suspended a little-known customs exemption that allowed goods of de minimis value \u2014 items worth less than $800 \u2014 to come into the U.S. duty-free. The order throws a wrench in the business models of China-based retailers like Shein and Temu, which were previously exempt from any tariffs and customs inspections thanks to the de minimis loophole.",
      "The rule change is also likely to result in delivery delays since the packages now have to go through customs, Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, told the Associated Press.",
      "Neither Shein nor Temu responded to requests for comment on how the new rules would affect their businesses.",
      "The de minimis exemption helped the Chinese e-commerce giants keep their costs low, and appeal to predominately young American consumers with contemporary styles at incredibly low prices. The companies ship directly to consumers, allowing them to compete with domestic players including Amazon, which launched its own answer to Temu and Shein last year, called Amazon Haul. Available strictly on the Amazon app, Amazon Haul features goods shipped from China that cost less than $10 and sells items that resemble those sold by Shein and Temu.",
      "How much could prices rise?",
      "Now that Shein and Temu are on the hook for existing duties they once bypassed, plus the new 10% tariff imposed by Mr. Trump, and potentially taxes collected by customs authorities, those added costs could be passed along to consumers.",
      "While the price increases could be negligible, some shoppers may be turned off by shipping delays brought by forced customers inspections of the packages.",
      "\"If the tariffs stick, we could see higher prices on electronics, clothing and other things,\" Ryan Young, senior economist for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group that argues for less regulation, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There will be frustrating delays, and this will put a damper on Temu, Shein and other low-cost vendors' business models.\"",

      "Foodborne illness kills hundreds of Americans a year, sickens tens of millions annually, and costs billions in medical care, lost productivity and premature deaths, federal researchers said in a report.",
      "Roughly 10 million cases of foodborne illness each year in the U.S. are caused by six pathogens \u2014 salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens, shiga toxin-producing E. coli and norovirus, according to a coming study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The illnesses result in about 53,300 hospitalizations and more than 900 deaths annually, according to CDC estimates cited this week by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO).",
      "The economic impact of these diseases is severe, costing an estimated $75 billion (in 2023 dollars) annually, including costs associated with secondary chronic illnesses and conditions that develop after the initial illness, according to the findings published Monday by the GAO, which also cited research by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.",
      "The actual count of people who get sick from eating food is unknown and likely far higher than official tallies, as only a small percentage of illnesses related to contaminated food is diagnosed and reported to public health officials. For every case of salmonella detected through a lab test, for example, 29 illnesses are caused by the bacteria, the CDC estimates.",
      "Last year, separate salmonella outbreaks linked to cucumbers and eggs sickened more than 200 people in dozens of states, while listeria outbreaks linked to ready-to-eat meat and poultry products sickened 19, hospitalized 17 and killed two. An outbreak of E. coli in the fall of 2024 linked to organic carrots sickened 48 people in 19 states, killing one. Another linked to onions served in McDonald's burgers sickened more than 100 people in 14 states, resulting in one death.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 16:03:14 -0500",
    "summary": "Even next-door neighbors face starkly contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery, as nation's home insurance crisis grows.",
    "story": [
      "Before a wildfire ravaged their street in northwest Altadena, Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson lived next door to each other in nearly identical houses.",
      "\"I chose an old home in an old neighborhood because it has soul,\" said Hamlin, a 51-year-old single mom with a teenage boy, who bought her 1,500-square-foot home 10 years ago.",
      "Today, gone are their charming English-style cottages built in 1925 with the welcoming porches and Palladian windows. Amid the rubble and ash, little is left of their historic neighborhood.",
      "In the weeks since the Eaton wildfire took their homes, Hamlin and Wilson have been stumbling through the layers of business, bureaucracy and emotional trauma of surviving a natural disaster, with their sights firmly set on rebuilding.",
      "How they'll navigate rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery that reveals the nation's growing home insurance crisis. Her insurance has already paid out nearly a million dollars and she is searching for contractors. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "\"It changes the whole trajectory to your life,\" said Wilson, 44, who bought his house five years ago with his wife, who is six months pregnant with their first child.",
      "Hamlin's home was privately covered by Mercury Insurance, but Wilson was forced onto the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state's bare-bones insurance program \u2014 when SafeCo declined to renew his policy last May. The FAIR Plan insures people who can't get private coverage but need insurance as a condition of their mortgage.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters become more frequent due to climate change, many property owners find themselves struggling to find or afford private insurance. The issue is particularly acute in California, where some major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies altogether or are refusing to renew existing ones.",
      "State officials recently started rolling out new regulations to entice insurers to stay in California, with the hope of getting as many homeowners as possible off the FAIR Plan.",
      "FAIR, with its high premiums and basic coverage, was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders find a more permanent option. Yet the number of FAIR Plan residential policies more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies last year.",
      "For Wilson and Hamlin, their parallel rebuilding journeys serve as a cautionary tale. Wilson paid nearly 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, for less than half the coverage.",
      "\"That's why a lot of people call it 'The Unfair Plan.'\" said Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders.",
      "SafeCo's parent company Liberty Mutual said in a statement that it couldn't comment on any individual policies but acknowledged \"difficult but purposeful business decisions\" in California.",
      "Mercury didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurance companies, said California is fortunate to have the FAIR Plan, which is required to accept everyone. Ruiz said outcomes would be even worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said California is working to make sure all claims are paid. He said in a statement that his office is working to get homeowners off the FAIR Plan and back to traditional more comprehensive insurance coverage.",
      "A FAIR Plan spokesperson declined to comment on Wilson's case, and noted that it's difficult to compare policies and coverage.",
      "Thousands of people lost their homes in the Eaton and nearby Palisades fires, which were among the most destructive in California history.",
      "The FAIR Plan said it expanded staffing to meet the surging demand and has a funding mechanism in place to pay all covered claims. State data shows more than 31,000 wildfire-related claims had been filed as of last week, including roughly 4,400 claims under the FAIR Plan.",
      "Hamlin had standard comprehensive home insurance, with an annual policy premium of $1,264 at the time of the fire. She can receive up to $1.5 million to replace her home, other structures and personal property, including up to $303,000 for living expenses while displaced. Her policy further entitles her to coverage that could add more than $200,000 to help her rebuild.",
      "Wilson, meanwhile, pays a $2,000 premium for the FAIR Plan that sets his maximum payout at $686,000, including $100,000 for living expenses while displaced.",
      "Wilson also had to buy \"wrap-around insurance\" for $1,500 a year for issues the FAIR Plan doesn't cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects. That supplemental plan doesn't cover fire damage.",
      "Hamlin said Mercury's support has been exceptional, immediately sending her money and helping with next steps such as finding housing and getting contractor quotes. Within days, the company wired her tens of thousands of dollars to get started while the process fell into place.",
      "\"Being able to rest at night and wake up and deal with everything else is really important,\" Hamlin said.",
      "Meanwhile, Wilson has struggled to even talk to a FAIR Plan representative. There was zero communication in the first two weeks, contact information was listed incorrectly, phone numbers had no voicemail and emails bounced back.",
      "\"Half the time, I feel like I'm doing something wrong,\" Wilson said.",
      "After The Associated Press reached out for comment, Insurance Department spokesperson Michael Soller said a representative would contact Wilson directly.",
      "Wilson said he feels haunted by his choices. He thought he had bought property in a low-risk area, and had avoided looking for homes in another neighborhood further north after hearing that people there had been dropped by their insurers.",
      "Hamlin, too, was aware of the fire risks when she moved in. She previously lived in Pasadena and was surprised that State Farm, her then-insurance company, would not offer her coverage in Altadena. She chose Mercury because it was the cheapest option, and was considering pursuing even more robust coverage.",
      "\"I could have been dropped when Chris was dropped. Any of us could be at any time. It's just luck, really. It's nothing I did or didn't do,\" Hamlin said, stunned by the comparison. \"I had the same risk factors as everyone else.\"",
      "Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley, said the seemingly random nature of who gets dropped and when has much to do with insurance companies' complicated risk models.",
      "\"They're all trying to manage their exposure,\" Collier said. \"If you think about wildfires, you don't want concentrated exposure.\"",
      "Wilson said SafeCo requested an inspection of his property before deciding not to renew his policy. Panicked, he tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with them, offering to clear brushes, trim trees near the roof, and other wildfire mitigation efforts.",
      "Wilson shopped around aggressively with his insurance agent but to no avail, and resigned himself to the FAIR Plan, assuming he would eventually find private insurance again.",
      "There was another catch: Wilson said he couldn't get comprehensive replacement cost coverage on the FAIR Plan because his roof was too old. Instead, he ended up with what is known as \"actual cash value\" coverage, which greatly limits the payout based on the physical depreciation of what was lost.",
      "\"We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars and that's very, very painful,\" said Bach of United Policyholders.",
      "Citing rising fire risks and other problems, seven of the top 12 insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in California in 2023. State regulations give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing policies in high-risk areas, including consideration of climate change in premiums and passing the costs of reinsurance to consumers.",
      "But those are only short-term solutions, said Dave Jones, California's insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2018. He pointed to Florida, where officials have \"done everything the insurers asked California to do\" but yielded little success.",
      "\"We're marching steadily towards an uninsurable future in the United States because we're not doing enough fast enough to address the underlying cause, which is climate change,\" Jones said.",
      "Unless governments take on the financial burden of serious mitigation efforts, the price of California's fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, Collier of UC Berkeley said. That could be the underinsured \u2014 like Wilson \u2014 swallowing their personal losses, or all California homeowners collectively saddled with increased premiums, or both. State Farm, California's largest insurance company, this week urged the state to approve an emergency rate hike of 22% for homeowner policies starting in May after processing nearly 8,700 claims and paying out more than $1 billion to policyholders for the LA fires.",
      "\"There's a huge amount of risk in the system and there's a big question of who is going to pay for this,\" Collier said.",
      "Wilson expects he'll have to take out loans to rebuild. He's considering joining a lawsuit against Southern California Edison that alleges the utility's equipment sparked the blaze, in hopes of receiving settlement money.",
      "But with a baby on the way, Wilson said he can't fathom living in limbo on the FAIR Plan forever, and he's thinking about leaving California if private insurance remains out of reach.",
      "\"I don't want to have to be prepared to maybe lose everything again,\" Wilson said. \"Stuck paying for an insurance that doesn't cover anything. You don't want to live in a risky area. You don't have the safety net.\"",

      "Mattel Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro said in an earnings call with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday that roughly 40% of the company's toys are made in China, while noting that is less than the industry average of 80%. Overall, the fresh U.S. levies on Chinese good affect about 20% of Mattel's global production.",

      "\"We do work closely with our retail partners to achieve the right balance and always keep consumers in mind when we consider pricing actions,\" DiSilvestro added.",
      "Mr. Trump has also imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico, where Mattel sources almost 10% of its products, and on Canada. On Monday, the president paused those tariffs for at least 30 days after Mexico and Canada agreed to heighten security at their respective borders with the U.S.",

      "\"We're going to suffer as a small business, but so is everyone in this country,\" Dan Marshall, co-owner of family-run Mischief Toy Store in St. Paul, Minnesota, told CBS News Minnesota this week.

It's also causing concerns about DOGE's access to the personal and financial information of most taxpayers.",
      "\"There's no community of Americans that this system does not touch, and so I think the concern is that access to this system including personally identifiable information has been ceded to the president's billionaire friend for reasons that are passing understanding,\" Donald K. Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There are \"quite real risks\" that DOGE \"could potentially undermine that system and threaten millions of Americans from getting payments that they are due,\" he added.",

      "The letter stated that Tom Krause, a member of Musk's DOGE team who has been brought in as a Treasury Department employee, will \"have read-only access to the coded data of the Fiscal Service's payment systems\" as part of an \"operational efficiency assessment.\"",
      "\"This is similar to the kind of access that Treasury provides to individuals reviewing Treasury systems, such as auditors, and that follows practices associated with protecting the integrity of the systems and business processes,\" the letter read, describing Krause as a \"longtime technology executive.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "What is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service?",
      "The Treasury has long been the federal government's checkbook, tasked with handling payments for individual agencies based on funds appropriated by Congress. Its systems control the flow of over $6 trillion in payments to American families, businesses and other recipients each year.",
      "The Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service handles most of those payments. About 90 cents of every $1 in federal payments are sent through the little-known division.",
      "In fiscal 2023, the unit disbursed nearly 1.3 billion payments totaling $5.4 trillion, according\u00a0to\u00a0the agency. Almost 97% of the payments were made electronically and all were made on time, it noted.",
      "How did DOGE get control of the payment system?",
      "The executive\u00a0order\u00a0signed by President Trump that created DOGE directed all agencies to make sure it was given \"full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems and IT systems.\" DOGE itself is not a federal department.",
      "Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, gained control of the system after Treasury's acting Deputy Secretary, David Lebryk, resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk stepped down after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data, the Washington Post had reported.",
      "On Sunday, Musk\u00a0stated\u00a0that DOGE had stopped payments from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services to Lutheran Family Services, a faith-based charity that had been offering social services to refugees.",
      "Could this impact Social Security?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are raising concerns about the potential impact on government programs including Social Security, although neither Musk nor Mr. Trump have flagged Social Security as a target for cuts.",
      "Indeed, Mr. Trump has said he will preserve Social Security, and while on the campaign trail he vowed to eliminate taxes on Social Security Income. But because the Bureau of the Fiscal Services sends monthly checks to more than 70 million Social Security beneficiaries, some advocates say they're worried.",
      "Musk and DOGE \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, in an email. \"Seniors, their families, and people with disabilities most certainly cannot trust Trump and Musk with their crucial federal benefits \u2014 or their personal data.\"",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a Jan. 31 letter to Bessent that he's concerned that Social Security checks could be impacted, \"whether intentional or unintentional.\"",
      "\"It appears that Musk's behavior is forcing out highly qualified and experienced career public servants in order to get his way and fulfill Trump's goal of eviscerating the federal budget, including potentially by cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits for millions of Americans who are already struggling to pay their bills or buy groceries,\" he wrote.",
      "In a response to Wyden's letter, however, Jonathan Blum, a legislative affairs official at Treasury, told Wyden that DOGE personnel are only only able to read \"coded data\" in the federal payment system and cannot change scheduled systems. DOGE \"has not caused payments for obligations such as Social Security and Medicare to be delayed or re-routed,\" Blum wrote.",
      "Bloomberg was the first to report on the letter.",
      "Warren said Blum's letter raised more questions than answers. \"It asserts that a set of Treasury staff members have 'read-only' access but fails to answer questions about non-Treasury employees, like those working for Elon Musk and DOGE,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Does Musk have access to taxpayers' personal data?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are also raising concerns about DOGE's access to personal data for millions of American taxpayers. Because the Bureau of the Fiscal Service distributes tax refunds and Social Security payments, it has access to the Social Security numbers and bank accounts of recipients.",
      "Kate Miller, who serves on an advisory board for DOGE, didn't respond to requests for comment but did\u00a0repost an Associated Press article on X\u00a0with the comment, \"No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Access to that personal information could pose risks to taxpayers, according to data safety experts.",
      "\"Traditionally, access to this information has been highly restricted and among the most secure information the U.S. government holds,\" said James E. Lee, the president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 14:17:18 -0500",
    "summary": "The world's two biggest economies are on the brink of an economically destructive trade war. Here's what experts think could happen next.",
    "story": [
      "The quick-fire volley of tariffs between the U.S. and China in recent days has heightened global fears of a new trade war between the world's two largest economies. Yet while experts think the battle is likely to escalate, they also say the early skirmishes offer hope for an agreement on trade and other key issues that could head off a larger conflict.",
      "After the Trump administration's additional 10% levy on Chinese imports took effect Tuesday, China announced a 15% tariff\u00a0on U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some cars, that is set to kick in Feb. 10. China also put limits on exports of vital minerals used in high-tech products; opened an antitrust probe into Google; and placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list \u2014 PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China.",
      "Notably, however, the U.S. opted to hit China with a relatively modest tariff, rather than levies of up to 60%, as President Trump had previously threatened. For its part, Beijing also pulled its punches by targeting less vital U.S. sectors, leaving the door open for the sides to reach a deal.",
      "\"I think [Mr. Trump] backed off bigger Chinese tariffs because it became clear to him that it would eliminate any possibility of negotiation,\" trade policy expert William Reinsch, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce for export administration and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It would be trade prohibitive, and they would regard it basically as an act of economic warfare. So I think he went with a number that would not prevent future negotiations and would still send a signal, so he ended up with 10%.\"",
      "For now, Wall Street investors are also taking the countries' fresh trade sanctions in stride, betting that neither Mr. Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping are eager to start a mutually destructive economic war.",
      "\"It is all rhetoric for now. This is the negotiation stage,\" said Bill Dendy, a financial strategist at investment bank Raymond James. \"It is like two brothers starting to talk smack, and they'll start to throw punches, but they don't want to hurt each other. It's not good for anybody if it gets out of hand.\"",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, told investors in a report that China's retaliatory measures have \"clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the U.S. (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage.\"",
      "Even such efforts to avert a full-blown trade war could falter, spurring Mr. Trump to pursue a harder line against China, which he has long claimed uses a range of unfair practices that disadvantage U.S. businesses and workers.",
      "\"Edge of a cliff\"",
      "Reinsch said he expects Mr. Trump and Xi to hold discussions toward a deal that could lead to tariffs being repealed, or at least put on hold. \"These are all leverage moves,\" Reinsch said. \"The purpose is to force a negotiation on whatever it is [Mr. Trump] wants to negotiate, and he is good at brinkmanship. He goes right up to the edge of the cliff like he did with Canada and Mexico, and then he backed off in a way that allowed him to declare victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Feb. 1 announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. But the U.S. quickly\u00a0paused those duties for one month\u00a0after leaders of both countries said they would increase their efforts to curb the flow of illicit drugs and migrants into the U.S.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \"agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would invest $1.3 billion in better protecting its southern border.",
      "\"Trudeau and Sheinbaum figured out that that's the way to play it. If Trump is given an off-ramp where he can say, 'Ok, I won,' he'll take it, and that's what happened,\" Reinsch said.",
      "Whether such dynamics will ultimately work with China, and whether Xi is willing to indulge them, remains uncertain. After all, during Mr. Trump's first term he repeatedly imposed tariffs on China, leading Beijing to retaliate each time. Some experts think Trump officials will have to push much harder to obtain the kind of changes likely to satisfy Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This marks the fifth time in a row that Beijing has retaliated to tariffs, rather than make needed reforms. The first four times happened during Trump's first term and also got zero results. At some point, President Trump needs to figure out that tariffs will not get him what he wants from China,\" Ryan Young, senior economist for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group that favors deregulation, said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Risks for consumers",
      "The risks of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China are considerable, including rising inflation.",
      "\"If we continue to go down this road, that can be very detrimental to the U.S. consumer because it is the consumer that pays for these tariffs, as costs not easily absorbed by industries that have tight margins already,\" Dendy said.",
      "Unless the countries find a breakthrough, \"Americans can expect to pay a lot more for their technology goods, as well as their clothing and other things,\" he added.",
      "By contrast, U.S. prices are unlikely to soar in the short-term even if the conflict continues, economists note. For one, rising tariffs would likely slow economic growth, dampening inflation as consumers and businesses pare spending. Reinsch also notes that many American companies that import goods from China have prepared for the prospect of higher costs by preemptively building their inventories.",
      "One area where U.S. consumers could feel an immediate impact \u2014 their purchases of cheap clothing from Chinese fast-fashion retailers Shein and Temu. The new U.S. tariffs on China eliminate an exemption for packages worth less than $800, meaning that low-value goods are now subject to the levies.",
      "The U.S. receives roughly 1 billion such shipments annually.",
      "\"If you are Temu and Shein, you will probably to a hit on two grounds. They will have to start paying tariffs on dresses and T-shirts, so they will take a hit,\" Reinsch said. Those costs would be passed on the shoppers. Additionally, Mr. Trump has asked U.S. Customs and Border Protection to inspect low-value packages to screen them for fentanyl, which could create shipping delays.\"",
      "Implementing the 10% tariff on China, along with the 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico that are now on hold, would cost the typical U.S. household more than $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",

    "summary": "Court rules Metropolitan AME Church owns Proud Boys' trademark after the group fails to pay $2.8 million judgment.",
    "story": [
      "The ownership of the Proud Boys' trademark is now in the hands of a Black church that the group vandalized in 2020.",
      "The Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., was granted ownership of the group's trademark in a Feb. 3 ruling from Judge Tanya M. Jones Bosier of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The decision also gives the Metropolitan AME Church a lien on the trademark and the power to block the Proud Boys from using the trademark or selling licensed goods, like T-shirts or hats, without the church's approval.",
      "Reached for comment, former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio pointed to a statement he\u00a0posted on X. In it, he said the judge should be impeached and the church's nonprofit status revoked. The court's decision had been\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by the New York Times.",
      "Tarrio, who had been serving a 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy tied to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol building, was pardoned by President Trump after his Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "The ruling on the Proud Boys' copyright stems from an incident on Dec. 12, 2020, when members of the all-male right-wing group attended a \"stop the steal\" event in Washington, D.C., and also attacked the Metropolitan AME Church by climbing over a fence to get onto church property, where they destroyed a \"Black Lives Matters\" sign, according to court documents. A court ordered the Proud Boys to pay the church $2.8 million, money that the group has failed to pay, the documents note.",
      "As a result, the court gave the Metropolitan AME Church ownership of the trademark, providing them with the right to deny use of the group's name and yellow-and-black laurel wreath symbol.",
      "\"This is our time to stand up, to be very clear to the Proud Boys and their ilk that we came here fighting, that we have never ever capitulated to the violent whims of white supremacist groups,\" Rev. William H. Lamar IV, pastor of the Metropolitan AME Church, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If they thought we would be afraid, they were wrong. There are many people with us and who stand with us.\"",
      "The Metropolitan AME Church, which was founded in 1838 and has hosted speakers including Frederick Douglass and Eleanor Roosevelt, can now collect funds from sales of Proud Boys merchandise as well as its membership dues, people familiar with the case said. The church can also block the Proud Boys from using the trademark, they said.",
      "The notoriety of the Proud Boys' name likely helped the group in recruitment, which means blocking use of its trademark could both hurt the group's ability to sell merchandise and recruit new members, they added.",
      "\"From our point of view, it's fitting that the money the Proud Boys raised in sales and dues will go to fund the good work of the Metropolitan AME,\" Kaitlin Banner, who represented the church in the case and serves as deputy legal director at the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, told CBS.",
      "In his statement posted on X, Tarrio indicated he didn't intend to honor the court's ruling. \"I hold in contempt any motions, judgments and orders issued against me,\" he wrote.",

      "China said Tuesday it would counter President Trump's tariffs on Chinese products with tariffs of its own on multiple U.S. imports. It also announced an antitrust investigation into Google and other trade measures aimed at the U.S., ratcheting up trade tensions between the two economic heavyweights.",
      "U.S. tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico were also set to go into effect Tuesday but Mr. Trump paused his plans to\u00a0implement them\u00a0for at least a month after talks with the leaders of both countries, who vowed to step up efforts to combat the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S. He planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days.",
      "China said Tuesday it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S. The tariffs would take effect next Monday.",
      "\"The U.S.'s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,\" the statement from a Ministry of Finance office said. \"It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing said it would file a complaint with the WTO over the \"malicious\" levies, Agence France-Presse reports.",
      "China is the world's largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with its top suppliers being Australia, Qatar and Malaysia. The U.S., which is the biggest exporter of LNG globally, does not significantly export LNG to China.",
      "In addition, China's State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it is investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws. The announcement didn't mention the tariffs but came just minutes after Mr. Trump's 10% tariffs on China were to take effect.",
      "It's unclear how the probe will affect Google's operations. Google has a limited presence in China, and its search engine is blocked in the country like most other Western platforms. Google exited the Chinese market in 2010 after refusing to comply with censorship requests from the Chinese government and following a series of cyberattacks on the company.",
      "Google didn't immediately comment.",

      "In addition to the tariffs and Google probe, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they're essential to U.S. economic or national security and have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on key elements such as gallium, which is used in manufacturing.",
      "The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list: PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing bars them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country.",
      "Beijing began investigating PVH Group in September last year over \"improper Xinjiang-related behavior\" after the company allegedly boycotted the use of Xinjiang cotton.",
      "Possible ramifications",
      "Analysts said China's retaliatory measures would not only cause adverse effects on the U.S. economy but would impact the rest of the world.",
      "This isn't the first round of tit-for-tat actions between the two countries. China and the U.S. had engaged in a trade war in 2018 when Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded in kind.",
      "This time, analysts said, China is much better prepared to counter.",
      "\"They have a much more developed export control regime. We depend on them for a lot of critical minerals: gallium, germanium, graphite, a host of others. So ... they could put some significant harm on our economy,\" said Philip Luck, a former State Department official and director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Monday at a forum.",
      "The response from China appears calculated and measured, said Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of the Franklin Templeton Institute.",
      "\"I don't think they want the trade war escalating,\" he said. \"And they see (the) example from Canada and Mexico and probably they are hoping for the same thing.\"",
      "But, he adds, \"A risk is that this is the beginning of a tit-for-tat trade war, which could result in lower GDP growth everywhere, higher U.S. inflation, a stronger dollar and upside pressure on U.S. interest rates,\" Dover said.",

      "Wright, 60, has been chair\u00a0and CEO of Liberty Energy since 2011 and has no prior experience in government. He grew up in Colorado, earned an undergraduate degree at MIT and did graduate work in electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley and MIT. In 1992, he founded Pinnacle Technologies, which helped launch commercial shale gas production through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.",

The panel will include all executive branch agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, with a focus on \"cutting red tape\" and boosting domestic energy production, Mr. Trump said.

Canada responded hours later with retaliatory tariffs of its own, while Mexico said it was also planning to issue tariffs on the U.S. as well.",
      "China's commerce secretary said that China would challenge the tariffs through the World Trade Organization, according to Reuters, claiming that the move \"seriously violates\" WTO rules.",
      "However, Mr. Trump on Monday announced he would\u00a0pause the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days after both countries agreed to direct additional resources to their borders.",
      "The salvo, which Mr. Trump had threatened even before returning to power earlier this month, underlines his willingness to use trade policy even against some of the U.S.' largest economic allies. It also signals the president's first major turn away from his promise on the campaign trail to rapidly reduce everyday costs for Americans once in office.",
      "In a Truth Social post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump acknowledged \"some pain\" could come with the new wave of tariffs but insisted his vision for the country \"will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "\"THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA! WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),\" he wrote. \"BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID. WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE \u2014 AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!\"",
      "The tariffs\u00a0were slated to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. While the order imposes 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, \"energy resources\" such as oil and gas would only be hit with a 10% tariff.",
      "The order notes that should any of the three nations \"retaliate against the United States\" with \"import duties\" or \"similar measures,\" the president \"may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.\"",
      "According to the White House, the salvo is aimed at curbing the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.; spurring a resurgence in domestic manufacturing; and raising federal revenue.",
      "In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted to social media after the announcement, Mr. Trump said the order was issued through the\u00a0International Emergency Economic Powers Act\u00a0\"because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.\"",
      "Trudeau announced in a news conference Saturday night that Canada would retaliate by placing 25% tariffs \"against $155 billion worth of American goods,\" with the first set of tariffs taking effect Tuesday.",
      "\"This will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion worth of American products in 21 days' time to allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives,\" Trudeau said.",
      "And in a statement posted to social media, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she instructed her economic secretary to put together a response that included both retaliatory tariffs and other measures \"in defense of Mexico's interests.\"",
      "\"We categorically reject the defamatory claims made by the White House accusing the Government of Mexico of having alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any attempts to interfere in our territory,\" Sheinbaum wrote.",
      "John Murphy, senior vice president for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which bills itself as the world's largest business organization, slammed Mr. Trump's decision, writing in a statement that \"the imposition of tariffs under IEEPA is unprecedented, won't solve these problems, and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chains.\"",
      "Murphy added that the Chamber \"will consult with our members, including main street businesses across the country impacted by this move, to determine next steps to prevent economic harm to Americans.\"",
      "Three trade associations for the distilled spirits industry \u2014 Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S., the Chamber of the Tequila Industry, and Spirits Canada \u2014 said in a joint statement that they were \"deeply concerned that U.S. tariffs on imported spirits from Canada and Mexico will significantly harm all three countries and lead to a cycle of retaliatory tariffs that negatively impacts our shared industry.\"",
      "Bob Hemesath, an Iowa farmer and board chairman of Farmers for Free Trade, an agriculture group that advocates for more open trade, said in a statement that Canada, Mexico and China are \"indispensable markets for the livelihood of the American ag economy,\" and \"placing tariffs on the three largest export markets for American farmers and ranchers, particularly for an extended period of time, would have severe consequences.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the order, writing on social media that Mr. Trump is \"holding Mexico, Canada, and China accountable for their role in the flow of illegal aliens and illicit drugs across our borders. These countries are now on notice to work quickly to stop the madness. This is long overdue.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move in a series of social media posts, one of which read: \"You're worried about grocery prices. Don's raising prices with his tariffs.\"",
      "Experts warn that the impact of the tariffs could affect the economies of Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 the nation's three biggest trading partners \u2014 as well as the U.S. itself. Canada's economy could shrink by 3.6%, while Mexico could take a 2% hit, according to Cornell University economics professor Wendong Zhang.",
      "At the same time, inflation in the U.S. could rise by as much as 1 percentage point, pushing it as high as 4% on an annual basis, or double the Federal Reserve's goal for a 2% annual rate, Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 research note.",
      "\"We have stressed that steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock \u2014 a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse \u2014 while also triggering financial market volatility,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in a Jan. 31 report.",
      "Daco added, \"These tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China would mark the first major wave of trade levies in Trump's new term, with effects rippling far beyond those economies, as other nations brace for potential targeting and U.S. businesses navigate supply chain disruptions and retaliation risks.\"",
      "American consumers have been bracing for the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, telling pollsters that they expected to see higher prices if the president followed through on his plans to enact them. Those expectations may have prompted some consumers to purchase goods before Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists say.",
      "\"The mere prospect of tariffs appears to be influencing the behavior of consumers and businesses,\" analysts with Oxford Economics in a research note. \"Imports surged in December, likely an attempt to front-run any tariffs, while consumers may be bringing forward spending in anticipation of tariff-related price hikes.\"",
      "U.S. consumers could see higher prices\u00a0for produce and agricultural products imported from Canada and Mexico, including beef from the former and avocados and strawberries from the latter. Automobiles could see an average price increase of $3,000 each due to the tariffs, given the huge volume of cars now being built in Canada and Mexico, according to TD Economics.",

      "Republican officials have been quietly pointing out that the Trump administration's so-called buyout program is illegal, but they doubt that congressional Republicans\u00a0will push back, sources told CBS News.",
      "Many federal workers saw an email first thing Monday morning when they arrived at their desks that offered more details of the deferred resignations program.",
      "Some lawmakers have noted the offer of pay through Sept. 30 violates the Anti-Deficiency Act, a law that prevents the government from promising or spending money in excess of what Congress has made available. Congress has funded the government only through mid-March, not through the end of the fiscal year at the end of September.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump administration's Office of Personnel Management stressed that no federal employees' pay will be guaranteed with the deadline looming.",

      "Q: The current funding bill for the federal government expires on March 14. Will I still receive full pay and benefits if the money runs out?",
      "A: Any government shutdown could potentially affect an employee's pay regardless of whether he or she has accepted the deferred resignation offer. Moreover, if you accept the deferred resignation offer, you would still be entitled to backpay under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act.",
      "One Republican said in a text message, \"Anybody else would be walked out of an agency for going $1 beyond appropriated dollars. Back of the napkin math of offering to pay all federal employees for 6.5 months beyond current appropriations is about $50 billion \u2014 not everyone will take the offer, but it was offered to all of them, thus it incurs an obligation.\"",
      "Two lawmakers said the Trump administration's offer to pay any federal employees who accept the resignation proposal is not within OPM's power.

      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014 Almost 96% of new cars registered in Norway in January were electric, an unparalleled proportion in the world and close to the country's goal of selling only zero-emission vehicles as of this year. A total of 9,343 new cars were sold in January, of which 8,954 were all-electric, the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) said.",
      "Of the 50 most-sold models, only two were non-electric, the first of which came in 33rd place, the OFV said.",
      "By comparison, the share of electric cars sold in Europe was just 13.6% in the full-year 2024 \u2014 a decline for the first time since 2020, according to the car manufacturers' lobby ACEA. Even that far out-paces EV sales in the U.S., where, according to MotorTrend data from last year, only about 6% of new vehicles sold were electric.",
      "With President Trump now in office after vows to reduce incentives on EV sales brought in under his predecessor, a continued downward trend in U.S. uptake is entirely possible.",
      "\"We've never seen this before... If the rest of the year continues like this, we will very soon be close to the 2025 goal,\" OFV director Oyvind Solberg Thorsen said in a statement. \"But if we want to cross the finish line with 100 percent electric cars, it will be necessary to maintain the incentives that make it profitable to choose an electric car over other models.\"",
      "Despite being a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\" starting in 2025, which is 10 years ahead of the goal set by the European Union, of which Norway is not a member.",
      "In contrast to Brussels' plans, Oslo has not banned the sale of cars with internal combustion engines, having instead opted for a system of generous tax breaks that have made them competitive against heavily taxed internal combustion cars.",

      "How Norway has driven the EV transition",
      "While some tax breaks and incentives have been rolled back over the years, electric cars have become commonplace on Norwegian roads.",

      "\"Another reason was of course the benefits that come with them,\" he said, describing himself as a \"climate enthusiast.\"",
      "In his upscale neighborhood of Baerum in suburban Oslo, the streets are full of Teslas, Audis and Volkswagens. Competitively priced Chinese brands are increasingly appearing too.",
      "Many homes have a garage with an EV charger, in addition to Norway's vast national network of superfast charging stations that keep the nation rolling.",
      "That was a precondition for Hvattum, who, like many Norwegians, travels frequently by car to his chalet in the mountains several hours from Oslo.",
      "\"It's less complicated now that the network is so well-developed. You don't have to plan your trip as much as before,\" he said, adding that he uses the 15-20 minute charging breaks needed to make it up to the mountains to shop for food.",
      "Even if EV sales fail to meet the 100% mark this year, experts say that Norway can be seen as having met its goal.",
      "\"We should finish the year at between 95 and 100%, and probably even in the high end of this range,\" Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association, told AFP.",

      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the leader of Europe's biggest economy, Germany, said the EU was strong enough to take the blow and respond to any U.S. tariffs, but added that \"the goal should be that things result in cooperation\" within Europe.",
      "For a quick fact check on Mr. Trump's criticism: He's not wrong about the lop-sided trade relationship between the U.S. and its close allies across the Atlantic. Through November 2024, the EU ran a trade deficit of $78 billion with the U.S., according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and reports indicate that's on track to be a new record.",
      "The question many economic analysts and politicians across the world will keep asking, however, is whether huge tariffs taxing that trade are likely to help balance the books.",
      "The United Kingdom:",
      "Speaking to reporters early on Monday, Mr. Trump said \"the U.K. is out of line but\u2026 I think that one can be worked out,\" suggesting his administration was at least willing to negotiate with London over a new bilateral trade deal.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and stressed that he wants \"a strong trading relationship\" with the U.S., but the U.K. leader, five years after the \"Brexit\" withdrawal from the European Union, may now find himself caught between the formidable trade forces of the EU on his doorstep and Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs on the EU and his looming, if tempered threat to hit Britain with the same will complicate Starmer's nascent efforts to \"reset\" U.K. trade ties with the EU. He's at the helm of the U.K.'s first Labour Party government in a decade and a half, and it was the former Conservative leadership that ushered in Brexit and soured the long-standing close ties with Europe.",
      "Starmer has moved cautiously as he sets out to mend fences with the EU, wary of riling up conservative voters who supported Brexit and who, to some degree, now support populist politicians such as the Trump-aligned, anti-immigration leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister has ruled out rejoining the EU customs union or its single currency market, and he's so far resisted pressure from the continent to ease post-Brexit restrictions on U.K. and EU citizens living and working on either side of the border, at least for young people.",
      "But he still needs to get U.K.-EU trade moving again, and the extent to which he chooses to keep the bloc next door at arm's length, or to try to reinstate the close trade ties of before Brexit, could directly impact his chances of nailing down a favorable new trade agreement with Washington.",
      "Speaking Monday, a spokesperson for Starmer's government called the U.K.'s trade relationship with the U.S. \"fair and balanced,\" calling Washington \"an indispensable ally and one of our closest trading partners.\"",

      "Panama City\u00a0\u2014 Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Thursday denied the U.S. State Department's claim that his country had reached a deal to allow U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free.",
      "Mulino said he had told U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Wednesday that he could neither set the fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them and that he was surprised by the U.S. State Department's statement suggesting otherwise late Wednesday.",
      "\"I completely reject that statement yesterday,\" Mulino said during his weekly press conference, adding that he had asked Panama's ambassador in Washington to dispute the State Department's statement.",
      "On Wednesday evening, the U.S. State Department said in a social media post: \"U.S. government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the U.S. government millions of dollars a year.\" The department had no immediate comment Thursday on Mulino's remarks.",
      "The Panama Canal Authority put out its own terse statement later Wednesday night saying it had \"not made any adjustments\" to the fees, adding that it was \"willing to establish a dialogue with the pertinent officials from the United States in regards to the transit of U.S. Navy ships.\"",
      "Mulino said the U.S. statement \"really surprises me because they're making an important, institutional statement from the entity that governs United States foreign policy under the president of the United States based on a falsity. And that's intolerable.\"",
      "The differing versions came just days after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino and canal administrators and visited the critical trade route. He had carried a message from President Trump that China's influence at the canal was unacceptable, as the Trump administration makes a push for U.S. control of the canal, which it says it needs for America's economic security.",
      "The Panama Canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. And although the U.S. led the construction of the major waterway that around 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic now moves through, its control was given to Panama in 1999.",

If workers accept, according to a White House plan, they would continue getting paid through September but would be excused from reporting for duty. But if they opt to keep their jobs, they could get fired.",
      "That decision, one affecting the careers and livelihoods of Americans around the U.S., is fraught, employment attorneys and government watchdogs said. The offer, from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), includes a number of provisions that are unclear and not guaranteed, posing financial and professional risks while leaving workers in danger of not getting what they signed up for, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Trump administration also may lack authority to extend such a deal, and as such the deferred resignation allegedly breaks numerous laws, a Feb. 4 lawsuit filed by several federal employee unions alleges. The plaintiffs in that suit are asking a court to block the government's offer, which they describe as \"arbitrary, capricious\" and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, a 1946 law governing how federal agencies implement regulations.",
      "The deferred resignation offer is the brainchild of the second Trump administration, which has ordered federal workers to return to the office five days a week\u00a0while directing government agencies to end remote work arrangements. The White House expects to persuade up to roughly 10% of the federal civilian workforce to resign, saving $100 billion a year in costs.",
      "So far, about 40,000 federal workers have accepted the deal, or some 2% of the federal workforce, according to a CBS News source familiar with the matter, although that number could rise as the deadline nears.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt on Jan. 28 described the offer as aimed at \"making our government efficient and productive again.\"",
      "\"If [federal workers] don't want to work in the office and contribute to making America great again, then they are free to choose a different line of work, and the Trump Administration will provide a very generous payout of eight months,\" she said.",

Would you still get paid through Sept. 30?\"",
      "The agency's email lacks specifics and guarantees about the offer, adding to government workers' confusion, Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very confusing \u2014 it says you won't have to do your position duties anymore, but there is a caveat that says if they need you, you have to keep doing that,\" Greenwald said, referring to the resignation letter that says employees aren't expected to work except in \"rare circumstances.\"",
      "A dozen state attorneys general have also cautioned federal workers about accepting the offer, describing it as \"misleading\" and urging employees to closely scrutinize the terms.",
      "Elon Musk's \"Fork in the Road\"",
      "Federal workers received the Trump administration's offer in an email last month entitled \"A Fork in the Road,\" mirroring the subject line of a 2022 message\u00a0sent by billionaire Elon Musk to employees at Twitter, the social media platform he bought in October 2022 and later renamed X.",
      "Like Twitter's earlier deal, OPM's offer includes a demand that federal workers make a decision by a specific date. In his 2022 email, Musk told Twitter employees they had one day to decide to either agree to work in a \"hardcore\" style or quit and get three months of severance.",
      "Musk is spearheading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task force tasked by President Trump with slashing federal costs. The Tesla CEO has touted the government's deferred resignation offer on X, claiming that employees who accept it can do \"whatever you like, including obtaining a new job\" while receiving government pay and benefits through September.",
      "Although that could strike some workers like a good deal, the unions' lawsuit claims OPM may not have the financial authority to make that offer. For instance, the agency's email states it will pay workers who agree to resign by Feb. 6 through Sept. 30, but funding for most federal agencies expires on March 14.",
      "That indicates the Trump administration is planning to spend money \"before an appropriation is authorized,\" the suit claims. If so, that could violate The Antideficiency Act, a law that prohibits federal agencies from spending above their appropriated levels, the complaint alleges.",
      "The deferred resignation offer allegedly also violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the lawsuit claims. That law says courts can find government agency actions to be unlawful if they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"",
      "It's also not clear what could happen to federal workers who accept the offer if it is then found to be illegal by the courts, said Robert Weissman, co-president of government watchdog group Public Citizen. \"I could imagine going back to work and being told you did not work, and we're not going to pay you for an illegal program,\" he said.",
      "Government employees should \"be skeptical about what is actually going to be delivered through this offer,\" Weissman added.",
      "Impact on federal services?",
      "The offer also fails to consider the impact of widespread resignations on the government's ability to provide services to Americans, the union suit alleges. Twitter (now X) suffered from a number of issues after Musk cut the majority of its workforce, including a decline in advertisers and sharp drop in its valuation, the complaint states.",
      "A sweeping job-cutting measure could cause chaos if government agencies lacked enough staff to handle some services such as tax refund processing, Social Security verification, or providing health care through Medicaid and Medicare, experts say.",
      "\"There is no 10% across-the-board slush fund of employees that [the public] would not feel any harm by this,\" Greenwald said. \"The federal government is not Twitter \u2014 it is funded by Congress and budgeted by that process, and it is set to uphold the laws that Congress has passed.\"",
      "Federal employee unions are also chafing at the OPM's nine-day window for workers to make a decision, with the lawsuit calling it \"an arbitrary date ... selected to put maximum pressure on the federal workforce so that they would accept the offer, in many cases contrary to federal agency and federal employee interests.\"",
      "Giving federal employees just over a week to make a weighty career decision is a departure from previous voluntary resignation offers, with buyouts in the Clinton administration providing one year for workers to accept a deal, the lawsuit points out.",
      "Still, despite the unknowns in OPM's offer, it might make sense for some government workers, such as people who were already planning to retire soon, Nerney said.",

      "Thune reiterated his support for Israel earlier in the week, saying at the Senate GOP weekly news conference that \"Israel is our closest ally in the Middle East,\" while criticizing Democrats for boycotting Netanyahu's remarks at the Capitol in the past \u2014 and blocking a measure to sanction the International Criminal Court over the decision to seek the arrests of top Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, over alleged war crimes.",

    "story": [
      "The United States does not plan to stop distributing foreign aid around the world but needs to do a better job explaining and defending programs receiving assistance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told U.S. diplomats behind closed doors Wednesday.",
      "\"The United States is not walking away from foreign aid. It's not. We're going to continue to provide foreign aid and to be involved in programs, but it has to be programs that we can defend. It has to be programs that we can explain. It has to be programs that we can justify. Otherwise, we do endanger foreign aid,\" Rubio told about 200 staffers at the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City, according to a partial transcript of his remarks obtained Wednesday by CBS News.",
      "\"This is not about politics, but foreign aid is the least popular thing government spends money on,\" Rubio added. \"And I spent a lot of time in my career defending it and explaining it, but it's harder and harder to do across the board \u2013 it really is. But for those of us in charge of doing the work of foreign policy, we understand it is essential.\"",
      "The State Department and embassy did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Over 14 years in the U.S. Senate, Rubio served at different times as top Republican on the Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees and became a lead GOP voice on foreign policy matters.",
      "This week he is on his first overseas mission, a five-day tour of Central America and the Caribbean that is designed to reinforce his belief that the U.S. needs to more directly engage its closest neighbors as it seeks to curb illegal immigration and the trade of illicit drugs.",
      "The trip has coincided with a dramatic overhaul of the U.S. Agency for International Development that came to a head last weekend as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency confronted top agency officials, seeking to learn more about the scope of foreign aid. President Trump signed an executive order Monday essentially folding the agency's functions into the State Department and named Rubio its acting administrator.",
      "As part of the overhaul, USAID staff were told Tuesday that most staff would be placed on leave Friday night, with exceptions for \"mission-critical functions, core leadership and specially designated programs.\"",
      "Wednesday morning, when Rubio met with embassy personnel in Guatemala, he was asked by the head of USAID in Guatemala about the future of the agency.",
      "\"That's a question that deserves a straight and honest answer, and I'll give it to you,\" Rubio said, according to the transcript.",
      "He said he is hoping to choose all \"specially designated programs\" by Friday amid a broader review of all foreign aid.",
      "The secretary said he is now seeking input directly from ambassadors around the globe after receiving a list of USAID programs in Guatemala from U.S. Ambassador Tobin Bradley early Wednesday. But he also faulted agency officials in Washington for failing to cooperate with Musk's team.",
      "\"We hope to achieve \u2014 over the next 36 to 48 hours \u2014 what I'd hope to do in a more orderly way, from the top down\u2026 Now we're going to have to achieve it from the bottom up, defining what those special missions are,\" he said.",
      "Rubio cited USAID funding to combat Ebola and some projects run by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS, or PEPFAR, as early examples of exceptions that will continue.",
      "\"It has to be done in a way that's transparent, and we weren't getting those answers. We just weren't, at least not from the top down,\" Rubio said. \"So now, we're going to have to pursue it from the bottom up. That's always been our goal with our intention here, and that's going to continue to be our goal and our intention.\"",
      "On Saturday, two top security officials at USAID headquarters in Washington were placed on administrative leave, two sources confirmed to CBS News. Multiple sources said they were fired for attempting to block a DOGE team from accessing classified material in restricted areas.",
      "Even though Rubio is seeking to continue some funding as a broader review of foreign aid continues, it is unclear how the programs can continue if USAID staffers are locked out of their computers and office space and don't have access to funds.",
      "The email sent Tuesday to USAID staffers said the agency plans to consider \"case-by-case\" exceptions of staffers who need to stay on the job, and return travel extensions are possible based on \"personal or family hardship, mobility, or safety concerns.\"",
      "Rubio told diplomats Wednesday those exceptions \"came from input from the ground, not from anybody else.\" He cited examples of USAID employees who are married and have children with State Department staffers assigned to the same embassy.",
      "\"So now you're basically leaving them with the option of saying, 'So I have to leave behind my spouse and my children, potentially, and uproot myself and go.' That's not our intention. We don't want to achieve that,\" he said.",
      "He also noted, \"There are members of [USAID] that are in the third trimester of a pregnancy.\" Others, he said, might require special medical attention.",
      "\"We have a case, I know in particular, of someone who has to go to dialysis three times a week,\" he said. \"And so to be ordered to leave is disruptive in terms of, like, continuing with the course of care. And there are people that are deployed in places, frankly, where we don't want them stranded with them, because, it's not, you can't just catch a commercial flight and come home.\"",
      "He concluded his lengthy answer by asking the diplomats for grace.",
      "\"I know it's hard to ask for patience. I know it's hard to ask for trust, because you've never met me before. I've never been in charge of the State Department. I've never been acting USAID administrator before. I don't get paid double for doing that, by the way.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Maryland on Wednesday temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship\u00a0from taking effect nationwide, becoming the second to rule against the president amid a rush of legal challenges\u00a0to his directive.",
      "U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman, appointed by former President Joe Biden, agreed to grant a preliminary injunction sought by immigrants-rights groups after conducting a hearing on the request. The organizations, led by Maryland-based CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, filed a lawsuit arguing Mr. Trump's executive order targeting birthright citizenship violates the Constitution and federal law.",
      "In a 32-page opinion, Boardman wrote that Mr. Trump's order interprets the Constitution's Citizenship Clause \"in a manner that the Supreme Court has resoundingly rejected and no court in the country has ever endorsed.\"",
      "\"The president's novel interpretation of the Citizenship Clause contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment and conflicts with 125-year-old binding Supreme Court precedent,\" she wrote.",
      "The judge said that when children who would be covered by Mr. Trump's order are born, they will be U.S. citizens under the 14th Amendment and Supreme Court precedent. If the president's order remains in place, she wrote, children born in the U.S. subject to it will be denied the benefits and rights of U.S. citizenship.",
      "\"The president does not have the authority to strip them of their constitutional right to citizenship by birth,\" she wrote.",
      "The groups challenging Mr. Trump's order on birthright citizenship cheered the judge's decision.",
      "\"This is a victory for our families, for our country, and for the Constitution of the United States. This is the level of fight that will be required for the next four years of the Trump administration,\" George Escobar, chief of Programs and Services of CASA, one of the groups that challenged the order, said. \"The pregnant women who took this case up against President Trump \u2014 and so many immigrants across the country \u2014 can breathe easier knowing that their precious children are citizens and afforded the full rights that come with that.\"",
      "The suit brought in Maryland is one of at least eight that were filed in courts from coast to coast soon after Mr. Trump signed the order on his first day in office. Entitled \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\" the directive denies U.S. citizenship to children born to mothers who are in the country unlawfully or temporarily on visas, and whose fathers are neither citizens nor lawful residents.",
      "The immigrants-rights' groups are suing alongside five women who are pregnant and live in the U.S. They now fear their children will be denied U.S. citizenship because of their immigration status and that of their fathers, according to the filing.",
      "\"Every day, babies are being born in the United States whose constitutionally guaranteed citizenship will be called into doubt under the Executive Order,\" they wrote in their suit.",
      "Swapna Reddy, co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, said the court's decision was the right one and warned that Mr. Trump's executive order \"has created chaos for so many families, including ASAP members, who are scared their children will not be able to live a life free of fear in the only country they will have ever known.\"",
      "The groups are being represented by the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at the Georgetown University Law Center.",
      "Boardman is not the first judge to block Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship order. Last month, U.S. District Judge John Coughenour halted its enforcement in a case brought by four Democrat-led states, Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon.",
      "Coughenour issued a 14-day temporary restraining order to remain in place while he considered a request for a preliminary injunction and called Mr. Trump's directive on birthright citizenship \"blatantly unconstitutional.\" Coughenour, who sits on the federal court in Seattle, is set to hold a hearing Thursday to consider whether to issue a preliminary injunction.",

    "summary": "CIA employees have received letters offering them buyouts if they volunteer to resign.",
    "story": [
      "The CIA confirmed Wednesday that it offered buyouts to employees who volunteer to resign, the latest group of federal workers to receive such a proposal as President Trump pushes to transform the federal government.",
      "A CIA spokesperson declined to say how many people received the offers or whether they face any deadline to decide.",
      "However, the buyout offered to CIA employees differs from the \"fork in the road\" offer extended to other federal employees and includes Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, known as VERA, and resignation options. And it will not be available to all CIA staff, CBS News has learned.",
      "VERA enables agencies that are being substantially restructured or reorganized to \"temporarily lower the age and service requirements in order to increase the number of employees who are eligible for retirement,\" according to OPM. It's intended to encourage more people to voluntarily separate from their positions earlier and allow employees \"to receive an immediate annuity years before they would otherwise be eligible.\"",
      "There are multiple national security exceptions for the CIA buyouts \u2014 though it's not immediately clear exactly who might be included in these. While the CIA received an agency-wide message similar to the email sent to Office of Personnel Management personnel, eligibility for CIA personnel is limited and based on the mission requirements of certain employees, CBS News has learned. Those who work on high-priority issues may not be approved for the buyout.",
      "For example, some personnel with specialized skill sets designed for intelligence collection, including fluency in some foreign languages, will not be eligible to receive the buyout.",
      "In a statement a CIA spokesperson said of the buyouts that CIA Director John Ratcliffe \"is moving swiftly to ensure the CIA workforce is responsive to the Administration's national security priorities,\" adding that \"these moves are part of a holistic strategy to infuse the Agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position the CIA to deliver on its mission.\" The Wall Street Journal first reported the CIA resignation offers.",
      "The Office of Personnel Management has already offered millions of\u00a0federal workers about eight months of salary if they agree by Thursday to leave their jobs. The CIA and other national security agencies were initially exempted, but the CIA offers suggest few corners of the government will escape Mr. Trump's overhaul.",
      "Mr. Trump has long criticized America's intelligence agencies, and his new CIA director, John Ratcliffe, has promised big changes, claiming the CIA has strayed from its original focus on human-collected intelligence.",
      "Since he took office last month, Mr. Trump has launched an attempt to gut and reshape several federal agencies, most notably the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has been largely dismantled by Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, the leader of Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "National security experts have warned that deep cuts to the CIA and other agencies could put lives at risk by hampering their mission or reducing the flow of intelligence between the U.S. and its allies. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, urged CIA employees to carefully weigh the offer.",
      "\"There are few government agencies more essential to our national security than the CIA,\" Warner said in a statement. \"A lot of federal employees, including at the CIA, are my constituents, and I've been warning them that these 'buyouts' are empty promises, since Congress hasn't approved any money to do it. I'd hate to see people resign and then get stiffed like the contractors on President Trump's construction projects.\"",
      "Though the precise number is classified, the CIA employs thousands of people engaged in the collection and analysis of foreign intelligence, both at its headquarters in Virginia, as well as overseas postings.",
      "Ratcliffe told the Senate Intelligence Committee in January that the CIA must do a better job of harnessing technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing while also expanding the agency's use of human intelligence collection.",

      "Employees of the EPA's DEI office were placed on administrative leave on Jan. 22, once the executive order went into effect. Staffers with the Office of Environmental Justice were informed their department is expecting a similar written notice as early as Thursday, but it was unclear if all employees will also go on administrative leave or be immediately terminated.",

      "A current EPA staff member in the environmental justice office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said senior leadership held a two-and-a-half hour call on Wednesday to discuss the logistics of the order, but said managers would not have many details to share until the official notice is issued.",
      "Many on the call were confused and concerned. EPA staffers already received the Office of Personnel Management's \"Fork in the Road\" email, which offered deferred resignations to anyone who agreed to leave their position by Feb. 6. But this individual received an email warning that they could be immediately terminated because of their probationary status as an employee with less than a year in their current role \u2014 which was created under an Inflation Reduction Act temporary program with a two-year probationary period.

      "Democrats on Capitol Hill, and sources familiar with the situation, said the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has been inside the offices of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "The White House DOGE team is a cost-cutting initiative created by President Trump to find ways to trim federal spending. Billionaire Elon Musk is in charge of it, categorized as a \"special government employee.\"",
      "Former NOAA officials told CBS News that current employees have been told to expect a 50% reduction in staff and budget cuts of 30%.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who represents the state where NOAA is headquartered, said his office is investigating DOGE's work on NOAA, which includes such agencies as the National Weather Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service.",
      "\"Hearing reports that Musk's cronies are targeting NOAA \u2014 infiltrating key systems & locking out career employees,\" Van Hollen posted on X Tuesday. \"NOAA is vital for weather forecasting, scientific\u202fresearch & more. Their critical work saves lives. My team and I are looking into this & we will not stand for it.\"",
      "Congressional aides told CBS News that lawmakers have received multiple complaints about DOGE staff coming into NOAA offices.",
      "Former NOAA officials, who spoke directly with current staffers, confirmed to CBS News they saw DOGE visit NOAA headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, and the Hoover Building, in Washington, D.C., where NOAA's parent agency, the U.S. Commerce Department is located.",
      "\"They walked through security like it didn't apply to them,\" Andrew Rosenberg, a former deputy director for NOAA, said of DOGE staff. \"They were there and they were going through IT systems\u2026 They're not asking substantial questions about what NOAA does and the importance of its role.

      "Some health officials in the U.S. fear the shutdown of U.S. Agency for International Development missions may have disastrous results, as the stalling of foreign aid has forced delays in what they said was the \"chaotic\" early U.S. response to Uganda's swelling\u00a0Ebola outbreak.",
      "The outbreak marks Uganda's eighth from an Ebola virus. The first confirmed case in the outbreak was a nurse at a hospital in the nation's capital, Kampala, who contracted Ebola on Jan. 20 or Jan. 21 and died on Jan. 29.",
      "There are now six confirmed and six suspect cases. In two of the suspect cases, according to an internal slide shared with CBS News, health authorities have identified no epidemiological link to the other cases.",
      "More than a dozen Americans in Uganda are also among those so far known to have been exposed to Sudan virus, the type of Ebola that had infected the initial case. Those people so far have not shown symptoms, two people familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "There is no vaccine or treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration for Sudan virus. This Ebola strain has been fatal in at least 41% of reported cases during past outbreaks, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "The new outbreak coincides with the Trump administration's pause in foreign aid \u2014 including its response to international outbreaks that could spread. This has spawned uncertainty among health nonprofits, which now face unpaid debts and a sweeping freeze on much of their U.S. funding.",
      "\"What we're talking about are disaster relief workers, we're talking about health workers and people who are doing good and protecting America around the world,\" Dr. Atul Gawande, a former USAID global health director, told CBS News on Monday.",
      "The pause has resulted in understaffed contact tracing and screening of departing international travelers in Uganda, one U.S. official said, since many experts funded by the U.S. around the region have been laid off or ordered to stop work.",
      "USAID is set to put virtually all its staff on leave this Friday and is shutting down overseas missions.",
      "\"It puts the world at risk,\" said one USAID official in a message. \"I'm not an alarmist, but this is very bad,\" the official added.",
      "In 2022, an outbreak of Sudan virus in Uganda prompted a large American response. The U.S.\u00a0ramped up\u00a0screening and preparedness for the virus here and sent\u00a0staff and resources\u00a0to aid Uganda's efforts to contain its spread.",
      "Uganda's healthcare system had already been stretched thin in recent months, battling a separate outbreak of a different disease \u2013 mpox \u2013 that has resulted in at least 2,031 cases, according to the WHO.",
      "Spokespeople for the State Department and USAID did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "President Trump has also ordered the U.S. withdrawal from the WHO, which was paired with a demand for all U.S. government staff to immediately sever collaboration with the U.N. agency that is helping to coordinate the response within the country.",
      "A U.S. health official said that CDC usually works closely with the WHO and a country's health authorities, often meeting daily to coordinate the response to outbreaks like this.",
      "Despite the president's order regarding WHO, \"CDC has been cleared to speak one-on-one with WHO counterparts related to response activities in Uganda,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement. The CDC said such conversations are also allowed regarding responses to other outbreaks of concern in Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "Attempts by U.S. agencies to deploy staff to aid the outbreak response have also been delayed, one official said, amid government-wide pauses to travel and spending.",
      "More than 100 staff are currently working in the CDC's office in Uganda, a U.S. official said. Agency staff are also currently embedded within Uganda's response team. An additional team of CDC experts is expected to deploy to the country this weekend, another health official said.",
      "While officials secured a waiver on Saturday from the State Department to free up some funds for the Ebola response, many recipients of U.S. funds have been reluctant to accept the money because of the turmoil in Washington, two people familiar with the situation said.",
      "Nonprofits have also been grappling with a growing number of demands imposed by the Trump administration as a condition for receiving funds, like a sweeping order to purge all mentions of gender and diversity \"at every level and activity, regardless of your location or the citizenship of employees or contractors\" supported by U.S. dollars.",
      "In Uganda, groups are still waiting for clarification from their in-country contacts at USAID about how the waiver would apply to their work, the people said, wary of incurring more expenses that might never be repaid.",
      "Following Mr. Trump's executive orders, the country's health ministry urged all staff backed by CDC and USAID to \"continue working in the spirit of patriotism as volunteers,\" in a letter obtained by CBS News, as Ugandan officials sought \"to restore normalcy.\"",
      "\"Radio silence\" from the CDC",
      "The growing outbreak in Uganda has also left some state and local health authorities befuddled with the \"radio silence\" from the CDC, officials told CBS News.",
      "In past outbreaks, CDC officials were quick to start ramping up preparedness for the possibility of cases spreading to the U.S.",
      "External meetings and information sharing that health authorities usually rely on to communicate with CDC officials were canceled amid the communications \"pause\" across the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS.",
      "An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The communications pause was initially expected to end this past weekend, but many federal health officials say they're still facing delays or denials in getting approval to publish information or participate in external meetings.",
      "\"HHS continues to increase staff levels as we look forward to the new Secretary leading the agency. HHS has approved numerous communications related to critical health and safety needs and will continue to do so,\" Andrew Nixon, the department's communications director, told CBS News in an earlier statement.",
      "As a stopgap, some states have been working on informal partnerships to ramp up their own preparedness for the arrival of potential cases, officials said.",
      "The CDC was able to publish a travel alert on Wednesday about travel to Uganda, but it left out links and information from the WHO's updates about the outbreak.",
      "Other donors stepping in",
      "Not all health experts are alarmed about the current situation.",
      "Two U.S. infectious disease physicians who have worked with outbreaks in the country expressed confidence that other groups and countries would be able to fill the void left by American support, but acknowledged they're concerned about the possibility of undetected spread and delays in the response.",
      "In past outbreaks of Ebola, the U.S. has often funded many of the key steps to contain the outbreak in its earliest days, including rushing to set up isolation facilities and support the outbreak response from an array of non-governmental organizations with workers in the country.",

Thank you President Trump for coming to our communities to see this first hand, and meeting with me today to continue our joint efforts to support people impacted.\"",
      "Following two different meetings on Capitol Hill, Newsom joined Trump at the White House in a closed door meeting, which he called \"very productive\" as he discussed the need for \"unconditional disaster aid\" for wildfire survivors, according to a statement released by his office.",

    "summary": "On her first day as attorney general, Bondi issued orders to review Trump prosecutions and create a \"weaponization\" of government working group.",
    "story": [
      "In her first hours as attorney general, Pam Bondi issued a broad slate of directives that included a Justice Department review of the prosecutions of President Trump, a reorientation of department work to focus on harsher punishments, actions punishing so-called \"sanctuary\" cities and an end to diversity initiatives at the department.",
      "Bondi was confirmed by the Senate late Tuesday and was sworn in in front of President Trump by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The attorney general established a \"weaponization working group\" to review Biden administration law enforcement policies. The initial focus of the working group will be the Trump cases in New York \u2014 the indictment pursued by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and civil enforcement action brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James \u2014 neither of which involved federal prosecutors. The group will also review the two federal cases against Mr. Trump pursued by former special counsel Jack Smith and will examine the prosecutions of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "As the Justice Department has begun collecting information about the FBI agents who worked on Jan. 6 investigations and fired career prosecutors who worked on the cases, Bondi said in her directive that the working group would investigate \"improper investigative tactics and unethical prosecutions\" versus \"good faith actions by federal employees simply following orders.\"",
      "Bondi is also accusing the Biden administration of targeting Catholic Americans and parents at school board meetings, and abusing the FACE Act \u2014\u00a0passed in 1994 \u2014 which makes it illegal to harm, threaten or interfere with an individual \"obtaining or providing reproductive health services\" or damage a facility \"because such facility provides reproductive health.\" These efforts will also be reviewed by the working group.",

She added that her department would provide quarterly reports to the White House on the group's findings.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity, marking his latest move\u00a0targeting transgender rights.",
      "\"The war on women's sports is over,\" Mr. Trump declared at a White House event celebrating the mandate.",
      "The order, titled \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,\" mandates that Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, be interpreted as prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. Those not in compliance jeopardize any federal funding they receive, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"We're putting every school receiving taxpayer dollars on notice,\" he said.",
      "A White House official who briefed reporters on the order before Mr. Trump signed it said transgender female athletes can compete on co-ed or male teams. Republicans have argued that transgender girls and women athletes have biological advantages that are unfair and unsafe for other girls and women.",
      "\"This is about preserving women's sports for women, and that if you are not a woman, you should absolutely have opportunities in sports, but the burden should not always be on women to accommodate that,\" the official said.",

      "The bill has yet to see any movement in the Senate, where Republicans hold the majority and senators have been consumed with confirming Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees. It's also unclear whether the measure can amass seven Democratic votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster.",
      "The president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, Charlie Baker, called for clarity on the issue as he testified to Congress in December. But Baker said he was aware of \"less than 10\" transgender athletes among the more than half a million student athletes governed by the NCAA.",
      "\"We believe that's consistent with federal policy,\" Baker said in a contentious exchange with Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri about why transgender athletes were permitted to participate in women's sports. \"The clarity on this issue at the federal level would be very helpful.\"",
      "The NCAA said in a statement Wednesday that Mr. Trump's executive order \"provides a clear, national standard\" and its board of governors is reviewing the mandate and \"will take necessary steps to align NCAA policy in the coming days.\"",
      "\"The Association will continue to help foster welcoming environments on campuses for all student-athletes. We stand ready to assist schools as they look for ways to support any student-athletes affected by changes in the policy,\" the NCAA said.",

      "FBI supervisors have also received questionnaires for certain agents in their field offices that contain questions about their possible work on the Jan. 6 cases, such as whether they participated in a search, if they made any arrests or testified in court.",
      "Bondi has previously suggested that the Justice Department prosecutors who were involved in the cases against Mr. Trump would face their own investigation and has repeated the president's claim that there is a so-called deep state of career government employees working to undermine him.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 16:03:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Senate Republicans say they'll move forward with their own plan to approve key parts of the Trump agenda beginning next week, amid House delays.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans said Wednesday that they intend to move forward with their own plan to approve key components of President Trump's agenda beginning next week, as the House efforts to start the budget reconciliation process have stalled.",
      "\"It's time for the Senate to move,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters Wednesday, after briefing Senate Republicans on the plan during their lunch meeting.",
      "Congressional leaders have been pursuing a massive legislative package through the budget reconciliation process to enact Mr. Trump's agenda, including resources to bolster border security, extend 2017 tax cuts, incentivize domestic manufacturing and invest in American energy, while working to pare government programs and address the debt limit. But top Republican leaders have appeared disjointed in how to proceed, prompting weeks of back and forth over whether to pursue a one- or two-bill approach.",
      "Until now, Senate Republicans had deferred to the House to kick off the process, though they generally advocated the two-bill approach that would include an initial effort to quickly secure a border win, while stressing that the tax legislation would take time to write and should be addressed in a separate measure.",
      "The budget reconciliation process allows Congress to fast-track certain types of legislation and avoid the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But it's a complicated maneuver that comes with its own limitations on what can be included. In order to approve legislation using budget reconciliation, lawmakers must first approve a budget resolution, but the House has faced a backlash from conservatives in recent days over the legislation.",
      "Graham, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said that while he appreciates \"what the House is trying to do,\" he thinks it's important to get the money to implement Mr. Trump's border security policy. He argued that \"one big beautiful bill,\" which Trump and House Republicans have said they prefer, is \"too complicated.\"",
      "\"It's important we put points on the board,\" Graham said, saying the president's plan on border security is \"running into a wall of funding.\" He said Senate Republicans are discussing a bill with $150 billion for border security that he said would be paid for.",
      "House Republican leaders outlined a timeline for the single-bill approach, which starts with the markup of a budget resolution that they aimed to hold this week \u2014 and a pledge to have the package on Trump's desk before May. The timing would fall within the first 100 days of Trump's second term, and allow for three vacancies in the House Republican ranks to be filled, improving their chances at winning approval for the bill.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters on Tuesday, as Senate Republicans began airing frustrations with the pace in the House, that \"we are well within the margins of time that we have to work on and I'm very optimistic about it,\" adding that \"we've made a lot of progress.\"",
      "\"The Senate will not take the lead,\" Johnson said. \"We're going to take the lead, and we're right on schedule.\"",
      "Johnson told reporters after Graham's comments Wednesday that he would talk to him, calling the South Carolina Republican a \"good friend,\" while underscoring that \"the House needs to lead this if we're going to have success.\"",

      "Later that day, the National Weather Service in Alabama tweeted, \"Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian.\"",
      "Three days later, on Sept. 4, Mr. Trump insisted that the storm had previously been on a course for the state. He displayed a week-old map of the storm path, altered with a black marker to portray the hurricane as potentially heading for Alabama.",
      "\"That was the original chart,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It was going to hit not only Georgia but Florida. It was going toward the Gulf.\"",
      "The hurricane ultimately didn't make landfall in the United States, or come close to Alabama.",
      "Soon after, the NOAA's leadership released a statement that backed Mr. Trump and criticized the work of its weather forecasters.",
      "The inspector general's report said the statement \"unnecessarily rebuked NWS forecasters\u2026for doing their jobs.\"",
      "According to a report by a panel of the National Academy of Public Administration for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the inspector general report, the investigations concluded that the statement backing Mr. Trump was \"driven by external political pressure,\" through a \"request from the White House then-Acting Chief of Staff,\" and that Jacobs, the head of NOAA who has been nominated again, \"violated the Code of Ethics for Science Supervision and Management set forth in Section 7.01 of NOAA's Scientific Integrity Policy when they failed to engage the Birmingham WFO in the development of the September 6 Statement.\"",

      "According to the inspector general report, Jacobs felt pressured.",
      "\"In Dr. Jacobs's view, he could make the statement more accurate, but the Department would issue, or would cause NOAA to issue, a statement one way or another,\" the report said. \"If he resigned or were fired, he reasoned, the final statement likely would have been worse and more inflammatory.\"",
      "Despite the incident, some weather professionals at the American Meteorological Society meeting in New Orleans last month supported Jacobs, telling The Associated Press that they hoped Trump would pick Jacobs to again lead NOAA.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 14:17:18 -0500",
    "summary": "The world's two biggest economies are on the brink of an economically destructive trade war. Here's what experts think could happen next.",
    "story": [
      "The quick-fire volley of tariffs between the U.S. and China in recent days has heightened global fears of a new trade war between the world's two largest economies. Yet while experts think the battle is likely to escalate, they also say the early skirmishes offer hope for an agreement on trade and other key issues that could head off a larger conflict.",
      "After the Trump administration's additional 10% levy on Chinese imports took effect Tuesday, China announced a 15% tariff\u00a0on U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some cars, that is set to kick in Feb. 10. China also put limits on exports of vital minerals used in high-tech products; opened an antitrust probe into Google; and placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list \u2014 PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China.",
      "Notably, however, the U.S. opted to hit China with a relatively modest tariff, rather than levies of up to 60%, as President Trump had previously threatened. For its part, Beijing also pulled its punches by targeting less vital U.S. sectors, leaving the door open for the sides to reach a deal.",
      "\"I think [Mr. Trump] backed off bigger Chinese tariffs because it became clear to him that it would eliminate any possibility of negotiation,\" trade policy expert William Reinsch, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce for export administration and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It would be trade prohibitive, and they would regard it basically as an act of economic warfare. So I think he went with a number that would not prevent future negotiations and would still send a signal, so he ended up with 10%.\"",
      "For now, Wall Street investors are also taking the countries' fresh trade sanctions in stride, betting that neither Mr. Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping are eager to start a mutually destructive economic war.",
      "\"It is all rhetoric for now. This is the negotiation stage,\" said Bill Dendy, a financial strategist at investment bank Raymond James. \"It is like two brothers starting to talk smack, and they'll start to throw punches, but they don't want to hurt each other. It's not good for anybody if it gets out of hand.\"",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, told investors in a report that China's retaliatory measures have \"clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the U.S. (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage.\"",
      "Even such efforts to avert a full-blown trade war could falter, spurring Mr. Trump to pursue a harder line against China, which he has long claimed uses a range of unfair practices that disadvantage U.S. businesses and workers.",
      "\"Edge of a cliff\"",
      "Reinsch said he expects Mr. Trump and Xi to hold discussions toward a deal that could lead to tariffs being repealed, or at least put on hold. \"These are all leverage moves,\" Reinsch said. \"The purpose is to force a negotiation on whatever it is [Mr. Trump] wants to negotiate, and he is good at brinkmanship. He goes right up to the edge of the cliff like he did with Canada and Mexico, and then he backed off in a way that allowed him to declare victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Feb. 1 announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. But the U.S. quickly\u00a0paused those duties for one month\u00a0after leaders of both countries said they would increase their efforts to curb the flow of illicit drugs and migrants into the U.S.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \"agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would invest $1.3 billion in better protecting its southern border.",
      "\"Trudeau and Sheinbaum figured out that that's the way to play it. If Trump is given an off-ramp where he can say, 'Ok, I won,' he'll take it, and that's what happened,\" Reinsch said.",
      "Whether such dynamics will ultimately work with China, and whether Xi is willing to indulge them, remains uncertain. After all, during Mr. Trump's first term he repeatedly imposed tariffs on China, leading Beijing to retaliate each time. Some experts think Trump officials will have to push much harder to obtain the kind of changes likely to satisfy Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This marks the fifth time in a row that Beijing has retaliated to tariffs, rather than make needed reforms. The first four times happened during Trump's first term and also got zero results. At some point, President Trump needs to figure out that tariffs will not get him what he wants from China,\" Ryan Young, senior economist for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group that favors deregulation, said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Risks for consumers",
      "The risks of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China are considerable, including rising inflation.",
      "\"If we continue to go down this road, that can be very detrimental to the U.S. consumer because it is the consumer that pays for these tariffs, as costs not easily absorbed by industries that have tight margins already,\" Dendy said.",
      "Unless the countries find a breakthrough, \"Americans can expect to pay a lot more for their technology goods, as well as their clothing and other things,\" he added.",
      "By contrast, U.S. prices are unlikely to soar in the short-term even if the conflict continues, economists note. For one, rising tariffs would likely slow economic growth, dampening inflation as consumers and businesses pare spending. Reinsch also notes that many American companies that import goods from China have prepared for the prospect of higher costs by preemptively building their inventories.",
      "One area where U.S. consumers could feel an immediate impact \u2014 their purchases of cheap clothing from Chinese fast-fashion retailers Shein and Temu. The new U.S. tariffs on China eliminate an exemption for packages worth less than $800, meaning that low-value goods are now subject to the levies.",
      "The U.S. receives roughly 1 billion such shipments annually.",
      "\"If you are Temu and Shein, you will probably to a hit on two grounds. They will have to start paying tariffs on dresses and T-shirts, so they will take a hit,\" Reinsch said. Those costs would be passed on the shoppers. Additionally, Mr. Trump has asked U.S. Customs and Border Protection to inspect low-value packages to screen them for fentanyl, which could create shipping delays.\"",
      "Implementing the 10% tariff on China, along with the 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico that are now on hold, would cost the typical U.S. household more than $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",

      "It's not using \"End Racism\" for the first time since the NFL began using Super Bowl end zone stencils.",
      "\"The Super Bowl is often a snapshot in time and the NFL is in a unique position to capture and lift the imagination of the country,\" league spokesman Brian McCarthy said. \"'Choose Love' is appropriate to use as our country has endured in recent weeks wildfires in Southern California, the terrorist attack here in New Orleans, the plane and helicopter crash near our nation's capital and the plane crash in Philadelphia.\"",

      "Vance has proven to be essential in getting President Trump's most controversial cabinet nominees cleared through committees to a full Senate confirmation vote. Multiple Republican senators who were on the fence about supporting some of the president's picks have said it was Vance, their former Senate colleague, who helped them get them to yes on some of President Trump's most controversial Cabinet nominees.",

And I worked with Vice President Vance, and he got me those the requested answers,\" Young told reporters.",

      "Vance is particularly close to Senate Majority Whip John Barasso, who is responsible for counting votes and is considered an integral part of the team. While he only served in the Senate for two years before becoming vice president, Vance built key relationships in the chamber, and Republicans members view him a trusted colleague. He has been working the phones and talking to senators about their questions and concerns.",

      "\"In their own way, both Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr. represent parts of the new coalition in our party. To say they're unwelcome in the cabinet is to insult those new voters,\" Vance wrote in a post on X. \"To reject their confirmation is to reject the idea that President Trump decides his cabinet.\"",

Mr. Trump previously assigned former Vice President Mike Pence to lead the coronavirus task force in late February 2020 before the pandemic swept over the country.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The world warmed to yet another monthly heat record in January, despite an abnormally chilly United States, a cooling La Nina and predictions of a slightly less hot 2025, according to the European climate service Copernicus.",
      "The surprising January heat record coincides with a new study by a climate science heavyweight, former top NASA scientist James Hansen, and others arguing that global warming is accelerating. It's a claim that's dividing the research community.",
      "January 2025 globally was 0.09 degrees Celsius (0.16 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than January 2024, the previous hottest January, and was 1.75 C (3.15 F) warmer than it was before industrial times, Copernicus calculated. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Scientists won't regard the limit as breached unless and until global temperatures stay above it for 20 years.",
      "Copernicus records date to 1940, but other U.S. and British records go back to 1850, and scientists using proxies such as tree rings say this era is the warmest in about 120,000 years \u2014 or since the start of human civilization.",
      "By far the biggest driver of record heat is greenhouse gas buildup from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, but the natural contributions to temperature change have not been acting quite as expected, said Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate for the European weather agency.",
      "The big natural factor in global temperatures is usually the natural cycle of changes in the equatorial Pacific Ocean waters. When the central Pacific is especially warm, it's an El Nino and global temperatures tend to spike. Last year was a substantial El Nino, though it ended last June and the year was even warmer than initially expected, the hottest on record.",
      "El Nino's cooler flip side, a La Nina, tends to dampen the effects of global warming, making record temperatures far less likely. A La Nina started in January after brewing for months. Just last month, climate scientists were predicting that 2025 wouldn't be as hot as 2024 or 2023, with the La Nina a major reason.",
      "\"Even though the equatorial Pacific isn't creating conditions that are warming for our global climate, we're still seeing record temperatures,\" Burgess said, adding much of that is because of record warmth in the rest of the world's oceans.",
      "Usually after an El Nino like last year, temperatures fall rapidly, but \"we've not seen that,\" Burgess told The Associated Press.",
      "For Americans, news of a record warm January might seem odd given how cold it was. But the U.S. is just a tiny fraction of the planet's surface, and \"a much larger area of the planet's surface was much, much warmer than average,\" Burgess said.",
      "January was unseasonably mild in the Arctic. Parts of the Canadian Arctic had temperatures 54 degrees Fahrneheit warmer than average and temperatures got so warm sea ice started melting in places, Burgess said.",
      "Copernicus said the Arctic this month tied the January record for lowest sea ice. The U.S.-based National Snow and Ice Data Center had it as second-lowest, behind 2018.",
      "February has already started cooler than last year, Burgess said.",
      "But don't count 2025 out in the race for hottest year, said Hansen, the former NASA scientist who has been called the godfather of climate science. He's now at Columbia University.",
      "In a study in the journal Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Hansen and colleagues said the last 15 years have warmed at about twice the rate of the previous 40 years.",
      "\"I'm confident that this higher rate will continue for at least several years,\" Hansen told The Associated Press in an interview. \"Over the full year, it's going to be nip-and-tuck between 2024 and 2025.\"",
      "There's been a noticeable temperature rise even when taking out El Nino variations and expected climate change since 2020, Hansen said. He noted recent shipping regulations that have resulted in reduced sulfur pollution, which reflects some sunlight away from Earth and effectively reduces warming. And that will continue, he said.",
      "\"The persistence of record warmth through 2023, 2024 and now into the first month of 2025 is jarring to say the least,\" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn't part of the Hansen study. \"There seems little doubt that global warming and the impacts of climate change are accelerating.\"",
      "But Princeton's Gabe Vecchi and University of Pennsylvania's Michael Mann said they don't agree with Hansen on acceleration. Vecchi said there's not enough data to show that this isn't random chance. Mann said temperature increases are still within what climate models forecast.",

      "London \u2014\u00a0The Herculaneum scrolls have remained one of the many tantalizing mysteries of the ancient world for almost 2,000 years. Burnt to a crisp by lava from Mount Vesuvius in A.D.  79, the reams of rolled-up papyrus were discovered in a mansion in Herculaneum \u2014 an ancient Roman town near Pompeii \u2014 in the mid-18th century. Both towns were decimated by the Vesuvius eruption, and most of the scrolls were so badly charred they were impossible to open.",
      "Over the next two and a half centuries, attempts were made to unfurl some of the hundreds of scrolls using everything from rose water and mercury to vegetable gas and papyrus juice, according to the New Yorker.",
      "The few that could be opened were philosophical texts written in ancient Greek. But most of the scrolls were so badly damaged, they were considered illegible. More recently, researchers managed to decipher some select words using artificial intelligence, X-ray and CT scans to distinguish ink from the papyrus it was printed on.",
      "The mystery is still unravelling, and on Wednesday, a major breakthrough was announced. Researchers say they've now managed to digitally unroll and start reading one of the ancient scrolls. The scroll in question, known as PHerc. 172, is one of three stored at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Libraries in England.",
      "A team involved in the Vesuvius Challenge, a competition offering prize money to anyone who can help unlock the delicate scrolls, says it has virtually unwrapped the papyrus to reveal columns of text that Oxford scholars have already started working to decipher.",
      "\"This scroll contains more recoverable text than we have ever seen in a scanned Herculaneum scroll,\" said Brent Seales, one of the co-founders of the challenge.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" project lead Stephen Parsons told CBS News' partner network BBC News. \"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",
      "The breakthrough came when the team at the Bodleian Libraries brought the blackened scroll to the Diamond Light Source research facility in nearby Oxfordshire, where technicians used a massive machine called a synchrotron to create a powerful X-ray beam that was able to peer into the fragile relic without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimeter,\" Adrian Mancuso,  the facility's director of physical sciences, told the BBC. \"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally.\"",

      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published Monday in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",
      "The team also found high concentrations of plastic in meat bought at grocery stores.",

      "The study authors, all affiliated with Canada's University of British Columbia, said that the probability of space debris hitting an airplane is small, but the risk is rising due to increases in both space debris reentries and flights. The study focused on rocket bodies, which pose a greater risk because of their size.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was published in Scientific Reports. The study builds on work by the authors presented at the annual International Orbital Debris Conference.",
      "Space debris and risks to airplanes",
      "The study authors worked to determine the odds of a rocket body reentering in an airspace. They found that high-density regions immediately around major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern United States or around major cities Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "The odds of debris striking an aircraft is small, the study authors said, but a collision between a commercial plane and space debris could \"lead to mass casualties.\"",
      "The risk will only grow as space debris remains in orbit, the study authors warned. Trackable objects in orbit have doubled in the last decade. The number of daily flights has also nearly doubled since 2000. Large reentries occur almost weekly, the study authors note.",
      "\"Over 2,300 rocket bodies are already in orbit and will eventually reenter in an uncontrolled manner,\" the study noted. \"Airspace authorities will face the challenge of uncontrolled reentries for decades to come.\"",
      "Closing airspace to avoid collisions",
      "The study authors highlighted an incident in 2022, when a 20-ton rocket body was set to reenter the atmosphere. Predictions the night before the reentry showed that it may land over southern Europe. European space and air traffic industries issued a safety bulletin recommending that authorities implement airspace restrictions. Spanish and French authorities wound up closing part of their airspace. It was the first time airspace was closed for an uncontrolled reentry.",
      "The closures delayed 645 aircraft for about 29 minutes, including diverting some planes that were in the air. Airspaces in Italy, Portugal and Greece that did not close saw an \"unexpected increase in air traffic\" from diverted flights, creating \"different, operational risks\" than those posed by the falling space debris.",
      "\"The incident highlighted, among other things, a lack of preparation for this eventuality and a lack of harmonization of responses among states,\" the study authors noted.",
      "The rocket body eventually fell in the Pacific Ocean. The study authors argued that better than closing airspace would be if all rocket missions required controlled reentries, with charted flight paths and scheduled landings. Fewer than 35% of launches currently have controlled reentries, the study authors said.",
      "\"Uncontrolled rocket body reentries are a design choice, not a necessity,\" the study noted. \"If controlled reentries were used by all operators, the risks to people and aircraft would be greatly reduced.\"",

      "A colossal explosion in the sky, unleashing energy hundreds of times greater than the Hiroshima bomb. A blinding flash nearly as bright as the sun. Shockwaves powerful enough to flatten everything for miles.",
      "It may sound apocalyptic, but a newly detected asteroid nearly the size of a football field now has a greater than one percent chance of colliding with Earth in about eight years.",
      "Such an impact has the potential for city-level devastation, depending on where it strikes.",
      "Scientists aren't panicking yet, but they are watching closely.",
      "\"At this point, it's 'Let's pay a lot of attention, let's get as many assets as we can observing it,'\" Bruce Betts, chief scientist of The Planetary Society, told AFP.",
      "What we know 2024 YR4 and its chances of hitting Earth",
      "Dubbed 2024 YR4, the asteroid was first spotted on December 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.",
      "By New Year's Eve, it had landed on the desk of Kelly Fast, acting planetary defense officer at US space agency NASA, as an object of concern.",
      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on January 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a 1.6% chance the asteroid will strike Earth on December 22, 2032.",
      "The asteroid 2024 YR4 is now rated at Level 3 out of 10 on the\u00a0Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is \"a close encounter\" that warrants attention from astronomers and the public.",
      "If it does hit, possible impact sites include over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia, the IAWN memo states.",
      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth -- its next close pass will not come until 2028.",
      "\"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero,\" said Betts.",
      "A similar scenario unfolded in 2004 with Apophis, an asteroid initially projected to have a 2.7 percent chance of striking Earth in 2029. Further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "\"City killer\" category",
      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75 percent of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT -- more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "The good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft -- a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",
      "\"I don't see why it wouldn't work\" again, he said. The bigger question is whether major nations would fund such a mission if their own territory was not under threat.",
      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",
      "Lasers could vaporize part of the asteroid to create a thrust effect, pushing it off course. A \"gravity tractor,\" a large spacecraft that slowly tugs the asteroid away using its own gravitational pull, has also been theorized.",
      "If all else fails, the long warning time means authorities could evacuate the impact zone.",
      "\"Nobody should be scared about this,\" said Fast. \"We can find these things, make these predictions and have the ability to plan.\"",
      "Still, NASA tracks close approaches and calculates the odds of those space rocks \u2014 including asteroids, meteors and meteorites \u2014 impacting Earth.",
      "\"The majority of near-Earth objects have orbits that don't bring them very close to Earth, and therefore pose no risk of impact, but a small fraction of them \u2013 called potentially hazardous asteroids \u2013 require more attention,\"\u00a0according to\u00a0the website of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the center dedicated to studying near-Earth objects for NASA.",

    "story": [
      "Since ChatGPT was released just over two years ago, its use everywhere from the workplace to academia has expanded significantly. In schools across the country, teachers and administrators have been grappling with how to contend with this new tool. While some say it has benefits, others point out the negatives, like cheating.",
      "This is leading to a divide in classrooms across the country with some teachers encouraging the use of AI and others voting to ban it completely.",
      "\"We believe very strongly that AI literacy, actually teaching kids in developmentally appropriate ways, what A.I. is and isn't and then how to use those tools responsibly, is a better approach than just outright AI banning,\" Amanda Bickerstaff, CEO of AI For Education, a group that provides what it calls \"AI literacy training,\" told CBS.",
      "A former high school biology teacher, Bickerstaff now works with educators across K-12 and higher to adopt AI in their classrooms so students can learn how to use the tool ethically. She believes students need to be prepared for both the short- and long-term changes technology brings.",
      "However, philosophy professor James Taylor from The College of New Jersey disagrees.",
      "Taylor told CBS that he was open to using AI at first. But, after seeing many identical essays, often full of false or misleading information that was obviously AI-generated, he decided to ban it.",
      "\"If you type in a prompt, boom! There's the answer. But that means the student has now outsourced all of their thinking to a machine. They haven't worked out and developed the skills themselves,\" Taylor explained.",
      "In Taylor's philosophy classes, students have to complete handwritten assignments without any devices. Rather than allowing AI to do all the work, students are encouraged to discuss their views, analyze others' arguments and come to a conclusion on what's right.",
      "\"Using it responsibly is important, but I think there has to be some classroom spaces where it's prohibited and its use is eliminated,\" Taylor said.",
      "\"As soon as it's banned, it's forbidden fruit,\" Bickerstaff pointed out. She believes kids will use AI in ways that could be harmful if parents and educators don't allow or encourage their use.",
      "Instead, she's teaching students and teachers how to write effective AI prompts, which she says will enhance learning, and how to verify AI outputs.",
      "While both Bickerstaff and Taylor may not see eye-to-eye on bans, they both believe in taking a proactive, balanced approach to AI.",
      "\"We're living through an inflection point unlike anything we ever lived before,\" Bickerstaff said. \"Generative AI is becoming ubiquitous in a lot of our tools, social media and devices. If you have a new iPhone, then you already have generative A.I. models that are in your hands.\"",

      "All these years later it still amazes me how so many disparate things had to come together for me to use a computer in 1968. Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",

      "That was probably the first computer program I ever typed in. The elegance of the four lines of code appealed to my sense of order. Its instantaneous answer was like a jolt of electricity. From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 10:09:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Unions are suing to halt the Trump administration's \"deferred resignation\" offer, claiming it is against the law and jeopardizes workers.",
    "story": [
      "More than 2 million federal employees face a looming deadline: By midnight Eastern time on Thursday, they must decide whether to accept a \"deferred resignation\" offer from the Trump administration. If workers accept, according to a White House plan, they would continue getting paid through September but would be excused from reporting for duty. But if they opt to keep their jobs, they could get fired.",
      "That decision, one affecting the careers and livelihoods of Americans around the U.S., is fraught, employment attorneys and government watchdogs said. The offer, from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), includes a number of provisions that are unclear and not guaranteed, posing financial and professional risks while leaving workers in danger of not getting what they signed up for, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Trump administration also may lack authority to extend such a deal, and as such the deferred resignation allegedly breaks numerous laws, a Feb. 4 lawsuit filed by several federal employee unions alleges. The plaintiffs in that suit are asking a court to block the government's offer, which they describe as \"arbitrary, capricious\" and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, a 1946 law governing how federal agencies implement regulations.",
      "The deferred resignation offer is the brainchild of the second Trump administration, which has ordered federal workers to return to the office five days a week\u00a0while directing government agencies to end remote work arrangements. The White House expects to persuade up to roughly 10% of the federal civilian workforce to resign, saving $100 billion a year in costs.",
      "So far, about 40,000 federal workers have accepted the deal, or some 2% of the federal workforce, according to a CBS News source familiar with the matter, although that number could rise as the deadline nears.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt on Jan. 28 described the offer as aimed at \"making our government efficient and productive again.\"",
      "\"If [federal workers] don't want to work in the office and contribute to making America great again, then they are free to choose a different line of work, and the Trump Administration will provide a very generous payout of eight months,\" she said.",
      "The offer isn't available to members of the armed forces, U.S. Postal Service workers, and those who work in jobs related to immigration enforcement and national security, according to the OPM.",
      "Risks to workers",
      "OPM's offer includes many gray areas that could present pitfalls to employees who accept it, experts said.",
      "\"There is a risk for employees to take this without knowing what would happen down the line,\" said Ryan Nerney, managing partner at law firm Tully Rinckey and an expert on federal employment law. \"If you decide to take this, and let's say there's a reduction in force and your job is eliminated, there is no guidance on what would happen in a circumstance like that. Would you still get paid through Sept. 30?\"",
      "The agency's email lacks specifics and guarantees about the offer, adding to government workers' confusion, Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very confusing \u2014 it says you won't have to do your position duties anymore, but there is a caveat that says if they need you, you have to keep doing that,\" Greenwald said, referring to the resignation letter that says employees aren't expected to work except in \"rare circumstances.\"",
      "A dozen state attorneys general have also cautioned federal workers about accepting the offer, describing it as \"misleading\" and urging employees to closely scrutinize the terms.",
      "Elon Musk's \"Fork in the Road\"",
      "Federal workers received the Trump administration's offer in an email last month entitled \"A Fork in the Road,\" mirroring the subject line of a 2022 message\u00a0sent by billionaire Elon Musk to employees at Twitter, the social media platform he bought in October 2022 and later renamed X.",
      "Like Twitter's earlier deal, OPM's offer includes a demand that federal workers make a decision by a specific date. In his 2022 email, Musk told Twitter employees they had one day to decide to either agree to work in a \"hardcore\" style or quit and get three months of severance.",
      "Musk is spearheading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task force tasked by President Trump with slashing federal costs. The Tesla CEO has touted the government's deferred resignation offer on X, claiming that employees who accept it can do \"whatever you like, including obtaining a new job\" while receiving government pay and benefits through September.",
      "Although that could strike some workers like a good deal, the unions' lawsuit claims OPM may not have the financial authority to make that offer. For instance, the agency's email states it will pay workers who agree to resign by Feb. 6 through Sept. 30, but funding for most federal agencies expires on March 14.",
      "That indicates the Trump administration is planning to spend money \"before an appropriation is authorized,\" the suit claims. If so, that could violate The Antideficiency Act, a law that prohibits federal agencies from spending above their appropriated levels, the complaint alleges.",
      "The deferred resignation offer allegedly also violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the lawsuit claims. That law says courts can find government agency actions to be unlawful if they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"",
      "It's also not clear what could happen to federal workers who accept the offer if it is then found to be illegal by the courts, said Robert Weissman, co-president of government watchdog group Public Citizen. \"I could imagine going back to work and being told you did not work, and we're not going to pay you for an illegal program,\" he said.",
      "Government employees should \"be skeptical about what is actually going to be delivered through this offer,\" Weissman added.",
      "Impact on federal services?",
      "The offer also fails to consider the impact of widespread resignations on the government's ability to provide services to Americans, the union suit alleges. Twitter (now X) suffered from a number of issues after Musk cut the majority of its workforce, including a decline in advertisers and sharp drop in its valuation, the complaint states.",
      "A sweeping job-cutting measure could cause chaos if government agencies lacked enough staff to handle some services such as tax refund processing, Social Security verification, or providing health care through Medicaid and Medicare, experts say.",
      "\"There is no 10% across-the-board slush fund of employees that [the public] would not feel any harm by this,\" Greenwald said. \"The federal government is not Twitter \u2014 it is funded by Congress and budgeted by that process, and it is set to uphold the laws that Congress has passed.\"",
      "Federal employee unions are also chafing at the OPM's nine-day window for workers to make a decision, with the lawsuit calling it \"an arbitrary date ... selected to put maximum pressure on the federal workforce so that they would accept the offer, in many cases contrary to federal agency and federal employee interests.\"",
      "Giving federal employees just over a week to make a weighty career decision is a departure from previous voluntary resignation offers, with buyouts in the Clinton administration providing one year for workers to accept a deal, the lawsuit points out.",
      "Still, despite the unknowns in OPM's offer, it might make sense for some government workers, such as people who were already planning to retire soon, Nerney said.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 20:38:02 -0500",
    "summary": "The strain, called D1.1, was behind a human death from bird flu last year.",
    "story": [
      "At least four cattle herds in Nevada have tested positive for a strain of H5N1 bird flu never before seen in cows, state agriculture officials confirmed Wednesday, and respiratory symptoms like coughing and sneezing have been reported.",
      "That bird flu strain, called D1.1 by scientists, was also linked to a fatal human case in Louisiana last year after exposure to sick birds. The D1.1 strain has emerged in recent months to dominate infections in wild birds and poultry flocks across North America.",
      "Symptoms seen in humans infected by D1.1 have been more severe than the previous bird flu strain that has been spreading in cows. That strain, called B3.13, has led to only mild symptoms, like pink eye and fever, in humans infected after contact with sick cows.",
      "Research suggests that B3.13 is less likely to result in severe disease for humans, unlike other bird flu strains overseas. The risk is different for other animals, like pet cats, which have frequently died after exposure to food and milk contaminated with B3.13.",
      "The discovery of the D1.1 bird flu strain's spread in cows also upends previous theories floated by U.S. health and agriculture officials that the spillover of the virus into cows from wild birds was a rare, one-off event.",
      "All cases of bird flu in cows since a spillover in Texas in late 2023 had previously been linked only to B3.13, which officials have cited as evidence that new variants of the virus were not repeatedly spreading into cows from birds.",
      "\"The detection does not change USDA's HPAI eradication strategy,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said Wednesday, citing the federal government's plan to try to stop the unprecedented surge of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, in recent years.",
      "In addition to the human health threat posed by the virus, an unprecedented toll claimed by spillovers of the D1.1 from wild birds into chickens has driven up egg prices across the country.",
      "Nearly a thousand cow herds have been confirmed infected by bird flu to date, the USDA says, with detections across 16 states. Most recent cases have been in California.",
      "The four new cattle herds infected by D1.1 were reported in Nevada's Churchill County, a spokesperson for the state's Agriculture Department said.",
      "Bird flu was also reported in December from a herd in the state's Nye County, though those cows ended up testing positive for the B3.13 strain of the virus.",
      "The Nevada spokesperson said two additional herds in Churchill County have also now been placed under quarantine, pending laboratory results from the USDA.",
      "\"Symptoms of H5N1 D1.1 have been similar to the detections of B3.13. These include fever, reduced feed consumption, reduced milk production and mild respiratory signs (coughing, sneezing, runny nose),\" Ciara Ressel, Nevada Agriculture Department spokesperson, said of the cows' symptoms.",
      "Those herds were confirmed to have been infected as the result of a state investigation, the USDA said, after a silo that had received milk from the cows tested positive for the virus.",
      "\"USDA APHIS continues to work with the Nevada Department of Agriculture by conducting additional on-farm investigation, testing, and gathering additional epidemiological information to better understand this detection and limit further disease spread,\" the USDA said.",
      "It is unclear how many workers in the state may have been exposed to the D1.1 strain after working with those sick cows.",
      "A spokesperson for Nevada's health department referred a request to the Central Nevada Health District, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that 40 out of the 67 confirmed human bird flu cases since 2024 have been linked to exposure to dairy cows sick with the virus. Most of the others have been the result of exposure to infected poultry.",
      "In a news release last month, Nevada's Agriculture Department said the CDC \"maintains that the risk to humans remains low,\" and that it was \"working with state and county health officials to protect human health and safety.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment when asked if D1.1's spillover changes that risk assessment.",
      "\"It is critical that animal health biosecurity practices are enhanced to help prevent the spread of disease and protect animal and worker safety,\" state veterinarian Peter Rolfe said.",

It claimed Wallace suffered \"millions of dollars in reputational harm\" as a result of Lively's widely-reported legal battle with Justin Baldoni, who directed and starred opposite her in the film. Wallace is seeking at least $6 million in damages.",
      "Lively named both Wallace and Street Relations in an initial civil rights complaint that she filed in California before ultimately suing Baldoni and his production company Wayfarer Studios in New York federal court at the end of last year.",
      "Her complaint and lawsuit accused Wallace and his firm of participating in a retaliation scheme to intentionally damage Lively's reputation and disincentivize her from speaking out\u00a0 \u2014 allegations Wallace formally denied in his defamation action this week. Neither Wallace nor the firm are defendants in Lively's lawsuit against Baldoni.",
      "\"Wallace and Street were widely reported to be defendants in the Formal Lawsuit although they were not, the confusion having been sown by the Precursor,\" the defamation lawsuit read.",
      "In her New York lawsuit, Lively alleged that Baldoni's public relations team hired Wallace and Street Relations to orchestrate a digital campaign in order to turn public opinion against her. It suggested Wallace \"weaponized a digital army around the country from New York to Los Angeles to create, seed, and promote content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums,\" with the intention \"to eviscerate Ms. Lively's credibility.\"",
      "On Jan. 21, Lively filed a petition for deposition in Hays County, Texas, against Wallace alleging that she believe he was a subcontractor for a PR firm Baldoni is accused of hiring for the alleged smear campaign against her.",
      "Wallace's lawsuit said that Lively later filed to dismissed the petition because \"she knew of no facts to support the allegations against Wallace or Street.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Lively for comment.",
      "Lively first came forward with sexual harassment allegations against Baldoni in a December interview with The New York Times. Baldoni has since sued the publication and Lively for defamation. The latter sought $400 million from Lively and her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy, while again attacking the Times.",
      "\"This lawsuit is a legal action based on an overwhelming amount of untampered evidence detailing Blake Lively and her team's duplicitous attempt to destroy Justin Baldoni, his team and their respective companies by disseminating grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media,\" said Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, in a statement to CBS News after filing the second suit.",
      "A spokesperson from the New York Times called Baldoni's allegations \"meritless\" in a separate statement and \"recycled from equally baseless claims\" included in Baldoni's earlier complaint against the newspaper.",
      "Lively's legal team characterized Baldoni's counter lawsuit as \"another chapter in the abuser playbook.\"",
      "\"This is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim. This is what experts call DARVO. Deny. Attack. Reverse Victim Offender,\" the team said in a statement. \"In short, while the victim focuses on the abuse, the abuser focuses on the victim. The strategy of attacking the woman is desperate, it does not refute the evidence in Ms. Lively's complaint, and it will fail.\"",

    "story": [
      "In her first hours as attorney general, Pam Bondi issued a broad slate of directives that included a Justice Department review of the prosecutions of President Trump, a reorientation of department work to focus on harsher punishments, actions punishing so-called \"sanctuary\" cities and an end to diversity initiatives at the department.",
      "Bondi was confirmed by the Senate late Tuesday and was sworn in in front of President Trump by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The attorney general established a \"weaponization working group\" to review Biden administration law enforcement policies. The initial focus of the working group will be the Trump cases in New York \u2014 the indictment pursued by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and civil enforcement action brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James \u2014 neither of which involved federal prosecutors. The group will also review the two federal cases against Mr. Trump pursued by former special counsel Jack Smith and will examine the prosecutions of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "As the Justice Department has begun collecting information about the FBI agents who worked on Jan. 6 investigations and fired career prosecutors who worked on the cases, Bondi said in her directive that the working group would investigate \"improper investigative tactics and unethical prosecutions\" versus \"good faith actions by federal employees simply following orders.\"",
      "Bondi is also accusing the Biden administration of targeting Catholic Americans and parents at school board meetings, and abusing the FACE Act \u2014\u00a0passed in 1994 \u2014 which makes it illegal to harm, threaten or interfere with an individual \"obtaining or providing reproductive health services\" or damage a facility \"because such facility provides reproductive health.\" These efforts will also be reviewed by the working group.",
      "The new group will \"review the activities of all departments and agencies exercising civil or criminal enforcement authority in the United States\u2026 to identify instances where a department's or agency's conduct appears to have been designed to achieve political objectives or other improper aims rather than pursuing justice or legitimate governmental objectives,\" Bondi wrote. She added that her department would provide quarterly reports to the White House on the group's findings.",
      "Bondi also targeted sanctuary jurisdictions with an order to end funding to any that \"unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.\" She encouraged the department to pursue enforcement actions against sanctuary cities or states that do not comply with the federal government's immigration efforts.",
      "\"State and local jurisdictions must comply with applicable immigration-related federal laws,\" one memo says, adding that \"state and local actors may not impede, obstruct, or otherwise fail to comply with lawful immigration-related directives.\"",
      "In a separate memo targeting cartels and transnational criminal organizations, Bondi ordered \"additional resources and thoughtful charging decisions\" to fight illegal drug trafficking and pursue \"total elimination\" of these groups.",
      "Bondi also ended a moratorium on federal executions put in place by former President Joe Biden, who had ended federal executions during his presidency. In 2020, the first Trump administration carried out 10 executions after that had been paused for 17 years.",
      "\"Going forward, the Department of Justice will once again act as the law demands,\" a memo reads, \"including by seeking death sentences in appropriate cases and swiftly implementing those sentences in accordance with the law.\" The memo emphasizes that prosecutors should seek the death penalty in cases involving the murder of a law-enforcement officer or a capital crime by an illegal immigrant.",
      "Another memo establishes a task force to \"prioritize seeking justice\" for the victims of the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in Israel perpetrated by Hamas, emphasizing that the department is investigating Hamas leadership, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), and \"U.S.-based individuals and entities that provide funding to Hamas.\"",
      "Bondi also ended all diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts within the Justice Department and ordered full-time return to work for department employees by Monday, Feb. 24. The Justice Department did not disclose the percentage of staff who have been working remotely.",

The order throws a wrench in the business models of China-based retailers like Shein and Temu, which were previously exempt from any tariffs and customs inspections thanks to the de minimis loophole.",

      "Mr. Trump, asked the previous day whether Gaza's inhabitants would be allowed to return to the enclave if they did leave under his plan, said: \"I don't think people should be going back to Gaza,\" asking,\"Why would they want to return? The place has been hell.\"",
      "Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz on Thursday \"welcomed Mr. Trump's bold plan.\"",
      "\"I instructed the IDF to prepare a plan that will allow any resident of Gaza who is interested to leave to any place in the world that agrees to accept them,\" Katz said in a statement. \"The plan will include options for exit at land crossings as well as special arrangements for exit by sea and air.\"",
      "Palestinians and Israeli hostage families react to Trump's plan",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement drew immediate condemnation from Palestinian civilians and from Hamas, which warned it could threaten the fragile Gaza ceasefire agreement. It also worried some Israeli hostage family members.",
      "\"We came very close to dying, but we survived with the grace of God,\" Gaza resident Moeen Mohsen told CBS News' team in Gaza City. \"Unfortunately, there came a decision to displace us. We reject it in its entirety. We are still holding on to our right to live.\"",
      "\"We will not allow prejudice to the rights of our people, which we have struggled for many decades and made great sacrifices to achieve,\" the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, was quoted as saying by the Palestinian news agency Wafa. The PA has limited authority over the other, larger Palestinian territory, the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which is run separately from Gaza.",
      "\"These calls represent a serious violation of international law, and peace and stability in the region will not be achieved without the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital,\" Abbas said.",
      "Negotiations have begun over the terms of the second phase of the ceasefire deal, which has seen 18 hostages released by Hamas and other militants in Gaza since it came into effect on January 19, including one man who is an American citizen.",
      "In the current, six-week first phase of the deal, Hamas is to free more hostages every week in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners being released from Israeli jails.",
      "If the deal holds, the hostage and prisoner exchanges will continue, with a total of 33 Israeli captives set to be released during the first phase. If the agreement falls apart, those releases could come to an end, and that prospect has worried some family members of those still held hostage in Gaza.",
      "\"We are shocked. We didn't know about it, but it was clearly not a move pulled from the hip,\" Ronen Neutra, the father of Israeli soldier Omer Neutra, who was killed in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that sparked the war and whose body is still being held in Gaza, told the Israeli news outlet Ynet about the plan on Wednesday.",
      "\"We want to remind Trump and Netanyahu that human lives are at stake, and we need to return them as a top priority, and only after that if we want to make changes,\" Neutra said.",
      "Hamas condemned Mr. Trump's plan, calling it \"a crime against humanity, and a reinforcement of the law of the jungle at the international level.\"",
      "The U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group said it was demanding \"urgent regional and international action to put an end to these malicious plans, because any attempts to implement such plans will destabilize security in the region and beyond.\"",
      "\"We demand that the mediators, especially the United States, oblige the occupation [Israel] to implement the ceasefire agreement in its three stages without procrastination or manipulation, as we are committed to implementing the agreement as long as the occupation commits to it, and any manipulation in implementing the agreement may cause it to collapse,\" senior Hamas political official Basem Naim said in a statement.",
      "America's partners in the Middle East reject Trump's Gaza plan",
      "Regional powers, including American allies that had already rejected earlier suggestions by Mr. Trump that the more than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza be relocated to other countries, also spoke out against the plans the U.S. president iterated on Tuesday.",
      "Egypt's foreign ministry stressed the importance of a two-state solution to create a Palestinian nation.",
      "Jordan's royal court put out a statement as the country's King Abdullah II met with Mahmoud Abbas of the PA on Wednesday.",
      "\"His Majesty King Abdullah II stresses the need to put a stop to [Israeli] settlement expansion, expressing rejection of any attempts to annex land and displace the Palestinians,\" the statement said.",
      "Saudi Arabia quickly said it would not reestablish ties with Israel \u2014 a bilateral relationship that Mr. Trump has long hoped to foster\u00a0\u2014 without the creation of a Palestinian state.",
      "\"Saudi Arabia rejects any attempts to displace the Palestinians from their land,\" Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry said in a statement Wednesday. \"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has affirmed the kingdom's position in 'a clear and explicit manner' that does not allow for any interpretation under any circumstances.\"",
      "Reaction to Trump's Gaza plans from around the world",
      "Countries outside the Middle East also reacted swiftly to Mr. Trump's proposal.",
      "\"France reiterates its opposition to any forced displacement of the Palestinian population of Gaza, which would constitute a serious violation of international law, an attack on the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians, but also a major obstacle to the two-state solution and a major destabilizing factor for our close partners Egypt and Jordan as well as for the entire region,\" French foreign ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer reiterated Britain's support for a two-state solution when asked about Mr. Trump's plan during a parliamentary session Wednesday.",
      "Palestinians in Gaza \"must be allowed home. They must be allowed to rebuild, and we should be with them in that rebuild on the way to a two-state solution,\" Starmer told Britain's House of Commons.",
      "Russia and China also both released statements Wednesday supporting a two-state solution.",
      "Israel's current government \u2014 its most far-right, nationalist leadership in decades \u2014 and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who stood next to Mr. Trump as he made his plans public on Tuesday at the White House, have made it clear they are not interested in working toward a two-state solution.",
      "Dr. Sanam Vakil, Director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at the British Chatham House think tank, said Mr. Trump's \"provocative\" comments \"could be trying to disrupt conventional thinking on a longstanding conflict that has yet to be resolved or produce viable solutions.\"",
      "\"He equally wants to show continued commitment to Israel to placate supporters and high-level donors in the United States and shore up Netanyahu's fragile political balance of power to help the prime minister engage in phase two ceasefire negotiations,\" Vakils said. \"More broadly, this is also part of his extreme deal-making strategy that will lay the ground for broader Israeli-Saudi normalization talks. He could be using this to pave the way to promote Saudi normalization in exchange for no annexation.\"",
      "Vakil said there was a risk that Mr. Trump's statements could, in the near term, lead to a delay in the release of further Israeli hostages in the current phase of the ceasefire.",

The operation targeted multiple online communities that operate as part of an online network called \"The Com,\" where \"extremists around the world collude to groom and abuse children,\" according to a news release from Europol.",
      "Two members of an online group known as \"CVLT,\" pronounced 'cult,' were arrested in the United States on Jan. 30. The two men, who were not identified, participated in what \u00a0authorities described as a \"neo-Nazi child exploitation ring that groomed and then coerced minors into produce child sexual abuse material and images of self-harm.\" The investigations were supported by international authorities.",

    "story": [
      "The United States does not plan to stop distributing foreign aid around the world but needs to do a better job explaining and defending programs receiving assistance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told U.S. diplomats behind closed doors Wednesday.",
      "\"The United States is not walking away from foreign aid. It's not. We're going to continue to provide foreign aid and to be involved in programs, but it has to be programs that we can defend. It has to be programs that we can explain. It has to be programs that we can justify. Otherwise, we do endanger foreign aid,\" Rubio told about 200 staffers at the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City, according to a partial transcript of his remarks obtained Wednesday by CBS News.",
      "\"This is not about politics, but foreign aid is the least popular thing government spends money on,\" Rubio added. \"And I spent a lot of time in my career defending it and explaining it, but it's harder and harder to do across the board \u2013 it really is. But for those of us in charge of doing the work of foreign policy, we understand it is essential.\"",
      "The State Department and embassy did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Over 14 years in the U.S. Senate, Rubio served at different times as top Republican on the Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees and became a lead GOP voice on foreign policy matters.",
      "This week he is on his first overseas mission, a five-day tour of Central America and the Caribbean that is designed to reinforce his belief that the U.S. needs to more directly engage its closest neighbors as it seeks to curb illegal immigration and the trade of illicit drugs.",
      "The trip has coincided with a dramatic overhaul of the U.S. Agency for International Development that came to a head last weekend as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency confronted top agency officials, seeking to learn more about the scope of foreign aid. President Trump signed an executive order Monday essentially folding the agency's functions into the State Department and named Rubio its acting administrator.",
      "As part of the overhaul, USAID staff were told Tuesday that most staff would be placed on leave Friday night, with exceptions for \"mission-critical functions, core leadership and specially designated programs.\"",
      "Wednesday morning, when Rubio met with embassy personnel in Guatemala, he was asked by the head of USAID in Guatemala about the future of the agency.",
      "\"That's a question that deserves a straight and honest answer, and I'll give it to you,\" Rubio said, according to the transcript.",
      "He said he is hoping to choose all \"specially designated programs\" by Friday amid a broader review of all foreign aid.",
      "The secretary said he is now seeking input directly from ambassadors around the globe after receiving a list of USAID programs in Guatemala from U.S. Ambassador Tobin Bradley early Wednesday. But he also faulted agency officials in Washington for failing to cooperate with Musk's team.",
      "\"We hope to achieve \u2014 over the next 36 to 48 hours \u2014 what I'd hope to do in a more orderly way, from the top down\u2026 Now we're going to have to achieve it from the bottom up, defining what those special missions are,\" he said.",
      "Rubio cited USAID funding to combat Ebola and some projects run by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS, or PEPFAR, as early examples of exceptions that will continue.",
      "\"It has to be done in a way that's transparent, and we weren't getting those answers. We just weren't, at least not from the top down,\" Rubio said. \"So now, we're going to have to pursue it from the bottom up. That's always been our goal with our intention here, and that's going to continue to be our goal and our intention.\"",
      "On Saturday, two top security officials at USAID headquarters in Washington were placed on administrative leave, two sources confirmed to CBS News. Multiple sources said they were fired for attempting to block a DOGE team from accessing classified material in restricted areas.",
      "Even though Rubio is seeking to continue some funding as a broader review of foreign aid continues, it is unclear how the programs can continue if USAID staffers are locked out of their computers and office space and don't have access to funds.",
      "The email sent Tuesday to USAID staffers said the agency plans to consider \"case-by-case\" exceptions of staffers who need to stay on the job, and return travel extensions are possible based on \"personal or family hardship, mobility, or safety concerns.\"",
      "Rubio told diplomats Wednesday those exceptions \"came from input from the ground, not from anybody else.\" He cited examples of USAID employees who are married and have children with State Department staffers assigned to the same embassy.",
      "\"So now you're basically leaving them with the option of saying, 'So I have to leave behind my spouse and my children, potentially, and uproot myself and go.' That's not our intention. We don't want to achieve that,\" he said.",
      "He also noted, \"There are members of [USAID] that are in the third trimester of a pregnancy.\" Others, he said, might require special medical attention.",
      "\"We have a case, I know in particular, of someone who has to go to dialysis three times a week,\" he said. \"And so to be ordered to leave is disruptive in terms of, like, continuing with the course of care. And there are people that are deployed in places, frankly, where we don't want them stranded with them, because, it's not, you can't just catch a commercial flight and come home.\"",
      "He concluded his lengthy answer by asking the diplomats for grace.",
      "\"I know it's hard to ask for patience. I know it's hard to ask for trust, because you've never met me before. I've never been in charge of the State Department. I've never been acting USAID administrator before. I don't get paid double for doing that, by the way.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The world warmed to yet another monthly heat record in January, despite an abnormally chilly United States, a cooling La Nina and predictions of a slightly less hot 2025, according to the European climate service Copernicus.",
      "The surprising January heat record coincides with a new study by a climate science heavyweight, former top NASA scientist James Hansen, and others arguing that global warming is accelerating. It's a claim that's dividing the research community.",
      "January 2025 globally was 0.09 degrees Celsius (0.16 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than January 2024, the previous hottest January, and was 1.75 C (3.15 F) warmer than it was before industrial times, Copernicus calculated. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Scientists won't regard the limit as breached unless and until global temperatures stay above it for 20 years.",
      "Copernicus records date to 1940, but other U.S. and British records go back to 1850, and scientists using proxies such as tree rings say this era is the warmest in about 120,000 years \u2014 or since the start of human civilization.",
      "By far the biggest driver of record heat is greenhouse gas buildup from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, but the natural contributions to temperature change have not been acting quite as expected, said Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate for the European weather agency.",
      "The big natural factor in global temperatures is usually the natural cycle of changes in the equatorial Pacific Ocean waters. When the central Pacific is especially warm, it's an El Nino and global temperatures tend to spike. Last year was a substantial El Nino, though it ended last June and the year was even warmer than initially expected, the hottest on record.",
      "El Nino's cooler flip side, a La Nina, tends to dampen the effects of global warming, making record temperatures far less likely. A La Nina started in January after brewing for months. Just last month, climate scientists were predicting that 2025 wouldn't be as hot as 2024 or 2023, with the La Nina a major reason.",
      "\"Even though the equatorial Pacific isn't creating conditions that are warming for our global climate, we're still seeing record temperatures,\" Burgess said, adding much of that is because of record warmth in the rest of the world's oceans.",
      "Usually after an El Nino like last year, temperatures fall rapidly, but \"we've not seen that,\" Burgess told The Associated Press.",
      "For Americans, news of a record warm January might seem odd given how cold it was. But the U.S. is just a tiny fraction of the planet's surface, and \"a much larger area of the planet's surface was much, much warmer than average,\" Burgess said.",
      "January was unseasonably mild in the Arctic. Parts of the Canadian Arctic had temperatures 54 degrees Fahrneheit warmer than average and temperatures got so warm sea ice started melting in places, Burgess said.",
      "Copernicus said the Arctic this month tied the January record for lowest sea ice. The U.S.-based National Snow and Ice Data Center had it as second-lowest, behind 2018.",
      "February has already started cooler than last year, Burgess said.",
      "But don't count 2025 out in the race for hottest year, said Hansen, the former NASA scientist who has been called the godfather of climate science. He's now at Columbia University.",
      "In a study in the journal Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Hansen and colleagues said the last 15 years have warmed at about twice the rate of the previous 40 years.",
      "\"I'm confident that this higher rate will continue for at least several years,\" Hansen told The Associated Press in an interview. \"Over the full year, it's going to be nip-and-tuck between 2024 and 2025.\"",
      "There's been a noticeable temperature rise even when taking out El Nino variations and expected climate change since 2020, Hansen said. He noted recent shipping regulations that have resulted in reduced sulfur pollution, which reflects some sunlight away from Earth and effectively reduces warming. And that will continue, he said.",
      "\"The persistence of record warmth through 2023, 2024 and now into the first month of 2025 is jarring to say the least,\" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn't part of the Hansen study. \"There seems little doubt that global warming and the impacts of climate change are accelerating.\"",
      "But Princeton's Gabe Vecchi and University of Pennsylvania's Michael Mann said they don't agree with Hansen on acceleration. Vecchi said there's not enough data to show that this isn't random chance. Mann said temperature increases are still within what climate models forecast.",

      "The outbreak marks Uganda's eighth from an Ebola virus. The first confirmed case in the outbreak was a nurse at a hospital in the nation's capital, Kampala, who contracted Ebola on Jan. 20 or Jan. 21 and died on Jan. 29.",
      "There are now six confirmed and six suspect cases. In two of the suspect cases, according to an internal slide shared with CBS News, health authorities have identified no epidemiological link to the other cases.",
      "More than a dozen Americans in Uganda are also among those so far known to have been exposed to Sudan virus, the type of Ebola that had infected the initial case. Those people so far have not shown symptoms, two people familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "There is no vaccine or treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration for Sudan virus. This Ebola strain has been fatal in at least 41% of reported cases during past outbreaks, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "The new outbreak coincides with the Trump administration's pause in foreign aid \u2014 including its response to international outbreaks that could spread. This has spawned uncertainty among health nonprofits, which now face unpaid debts and a sweeping freeze on much of their U.S. funding.",
      "\"What we're talking about are disaster relief workers, we're talking about health workers and people who are doing good and protecting America around the world,\" Dr. Atul Gawande, a former USAID global health director, told CBS News on Monday.",
      "The pause has resulted in understaffed contact tracing and screening of departing international travelers in Uganda, one U.S. official said, since many experts funded by the U.S. around the region have been laid off or ordered to stop work.",
      "USAID is set to put virtually all its staff on leave this Friday and is shutting down overseas missions.",

      "In 2022, an outbreak of Sudan virus in Uganda prompted a large American response. The U.S.\u00a0ramped up\u00a0screening and preparedness for the virus here and sent\u00a0staff and resources\u00a0to aid Uganda's efforts to contain its spread.",
      "Uganda's healthcare system had already been stretched thin in recent months, battling a separate outbreak of a different disease \u2013 mpox \u2013 that has resulted in at least 2,031 cases, according to the WHO.",
      "Spokespeople for the State Department and USAID did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "President Trump has also ordered the U.S. withdrawal from the WHO, which was paired with a demand for all U.S. government staff to immediately sever collaboration with the U.N. agency that is helping to coordinate the response within the country.",

      "More than 100 staff are currently working in the CDC's office in Uganda, a U.S. official said. Agency staff are also currently embedded within Uganda's response team. An additional team of CDC experts is expected to deploy to the country this weekend, another health official said.",
      "While officials secured a waiver on Saturday from the State Department to free up some funds for the Ebola response, many recipients of U.S. funds have been reluctant to accept the money because of the turmoil in Washington, two people familiar with the situation said.",
      "Nonprofits have also been grappling with a growing number of demands imposed by the Trump administration as a condition for receiving funds, like a sweeping order to purge all mentions of gender and diversity \"at every level and activity, regardless of your location or the citizenship of employees or contractors\" supported by U.S. dollars.",
      "In Uganda, groups are still waiting for clarification from their in-country contacts at USAID about how the waiver would apply to their work, the people said, wary of incurring more expenses that might never be repaid.",

      "\"Radio silence\" from the CDC",
      "The growing outbreak in Uganda has also left some state and local health authorities befuddled with the \"radio silence\" from the CDC, officials told CBS News.",
      "In past outbreaks, CDC officials were quick to start ramping up preparedness for the possibility of cases spreading to the U.S.",
      "External meetings and information sharing that health authorities usually rely on to communicate with CDC officials were canceled amid the communications \"pause\" across the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS.",

      "The communications pause was initially expected to end this past weekend, but many federal health officials say they're still facing delays or denials in getting approval to publish information or participate in external meetings.",
      "\"HHS continues to increase staff levels as we look forward to the new Secretary leading the agency. HHS has approved numerous communications related to critical health and safety needs and will continue to do so,\" Andrew Nixon, the department's communications director, told CBS News in an earlier statement.",
      "As a stopgap, some states have been working on informal partnerships to ramp up their own preparedness for the arrival of potential cases, officials said.",

    "summary": "The world's two biggest economies are on the brink of an economically destructive trade war. Here's what experts think could happen next.",
    "story": [
      "The quick-fire volley of tariffs between the U.S. and China in recent days has heightened global fears of a new trade war between the world's two largest economies. Yet while experts think the battle is likely to escalate, they also say the early skirmishes offer hope for an agreement on trade and other key issues that could head off a larger conflict.",
      "After the Trump administration's additional 10% levy on Chinese imports took effect Tuesday, China announced a 15% tariff\u00a0on U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some cars, that is set to kick in Feb. 10. China also put limits on exports of vital minerals used in high-tech products; opened an antitrust probe into Google; and placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list \u2014 PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China.",
      "Notably, however, the U.S. opted to hit China with a relatively modest tariff, rather than levies of up to 60%, as President Trump had previously threatened. For its part, Beijing also pulled its punches by targeting less vital U.S. sectors, leaving the door open for the sides to reach a deal.",
      "\"I think [Mr. Trump] backed off bigger Chinese tariffs because it became clear to him that it would eliminate any possibility of negotiation,\" trade policy expert William Reinsch, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce for export administration and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It would be trade prohibitive, and they would regard it basically as an act of economic warfare. So I think he went with a number that would not prevent future negotiations and would still send a signal, so he ended up with 10%.\"",
      "For now, Wall Street investors are also taking the countries' fresh trade sanctions in stride, betting that neither Mr. Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping are eager to start a mutually destructive economic war.",
      "\"It is all rhetoric for now. This is the negotiation stage,\" said Bill Dendy, a financial strategist at investment bank Raymond James. \"It is like two brothers starting to talk smack, and they'll start to throw punches, but they don't want to hurt each other. It's not good for anybody if it gets out of hand.\"",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, told investors in a report that China's retaliatory measures have \"clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the U.S. (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage.\"",
      "Even such efforts to avert a full-blown trade war could falter, spurring Mr. Trump to pursue a harder line against China, which he has long claimed uses a range of unfair practices that disadvantage U.S. businesses and workers.",
      "\"Edge of a cliff\"",
      "Reinsch said he expects Mr. Trump and Xi to hold discussions toward a deal that could lead to tariffs being repealed, or at least put on hold. \"These are all leverage moves,\" Reinsch said. \"The purpose is to force a negotiation on whatever it is [Mr. Trump] wants to negotiate, and he is good at brinkmanship. He goes right up to the edge of the cliff like he did with Canada and Mexico, and then he backed off in a way that allowed him to declare victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Feb. 1 announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. But the U.S. quickly\u00a0paused those duties for one month\u00a0after leaders of both countries said they would increase their efforts to curb the flow of illicit drugs and migrants into the U.S.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \"agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would invest $1.3 billion in better protecting its southern border.",
      "\"Trudeau and Sheinbaum figured out that that's the way to play it. If Trump is given an off-ramp where he can say, 'Ok, I won,' he'll take it, and that's what happened,\" Reinsch said.",
      "Whether such dynamics will ultimately work with China, and whether Xi is willing to indulge them, remains uncertain. After all, during Mr. Trump's first term he repeatedly imposed tariffs on China, leading Beijing to retaliate each time. Some experts think Trump officials will have to push much harder to obtain the kind of changes likely to satisfy Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This marks the fifth time in a row that Beijing has retaliated to tariffs, rather than make needed reforms. The first four times happened during Trump's first term and also got zero results. At some point, President Trump needs to figure out that tariffs will not get him what he wants from China,\" Ryan Young, senior economist for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group that favors deregulation, said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Risks for consumers",
      "The risks of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China are considerable, including rising inflation.",
      "\"If we continue to go down this road, that can be very detrimental to the U.S. consumer because it is the consumer that pays for these tariffs, as costs not easily absorbed by industries that have tight margins already,\" Dendy said.",
      "Unless the countries find a breakthrough, \"Americans can expect to pay a lot more for their technology goods, as well as their clothing and other things,\" he added.",
      "By contrast, U.S. prices are unlikely to soar in the short-term even if the conflict continues, economists note. For one, rising tariffs would likely slow economic growth, dampening inflation as consumers and businesses pare spending. Reinsch also notes that many American companies that import goods from China have prepared for the prospect of higher costs by preemptively building their inventories.",
      "One area where U.S. consumers could feel an immediate impact \u2014 their purchases of cheap clothing from Chinese fast-fashion retailers Shein and Temu. The new U.S. tariffs on China eliminate an exemption for packages worth less than $800, meaning that low-value goods are now subject to the levies.",
      "The U.S. receives roughly 1 billion such shipments annually.",
      "\"If you are Temu and Shein, you will probably to a hit on two grounds. They will have to start paying tariffs on dresses and T-shirts, so they will take a hit,\" Reinsch said. Those costs would be passed on the shoppers. Additionally, Mr. Trump has asked U.S. Customs and Border Protection to inspect low-value packages to screen them for fentanyl, which could create shipping delays.\"",
      "Implementing the 10% tariff on China, along with the 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico that are now on hold, would cost the typical U.S. household more than $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The Herculaneum scrolls have remained one of the many tantalizing mysteries of the ancient world for almost 2,000 years. Burnt to a crisp by lava from Mount Vesuvius in A.D.  79, the reams of rolled-up papyrus were discovered in a mansion in Herculaneum \u2014 an ancient Roman town near Pompeii \u2014 in the mid-18th century. Both towns were decimated by the Vesuvius eruption, and most of the scrolls were so badly charred they were impossible to open.",
      "Over the next two and a half centuries, attempts were made to unfurl some of the hundreds of scrolls using everything from rose water and mercury to vegetable gas and papyrus juice, according to the New Yorker.",
      "The few that could be opened were philosophical texts written in ancient Greek. But most of the scrolls were so badly damaged, they were considered illegible. More recently, researchers managed to decipher some select words using artificial intelligence, X-ray and CT scans to distinguish ink from the papyrus it was printed on.",
      "The mystery is still unravelling, and on Wednesday, a major breakthrough was announced. Researchers say they've now managed to digitally unroll and start reading one of the ancient scrolls. The scroll in question, known as PHerc. 172, is one of three stored at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Libraries in England.",
      "A team involved in the Vesuvius Challenge, a competition offering prize money to anyone who can help unlock the delicate scrolls, says it has virtually unwrapped the papyrus to reveal columns of text that Oxford scholars have already started working to decipher.",
      "\"This scroll contains more recoverable text than we have ever seen in a scanned Herculaneum scroll,\" said Brent Seales, one of the co-founders of the challenge.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" project lead Stephen Parsons told CBS News' partner network BBC News. \"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",
      "The breakthrough came when the team at the Bodleian Libraries brought the blackened scroll to the Diamond Light Source research facility in nearby Oxfordshire, where technicians used a massive machine called a synchrotron to create a powerful X-ray beam that was able to peer into the fragile relic without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimeter,\" Adrian Mancuso,  the facility's director of physical sciences, told the BBC. \"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally.\"",
      "Last year, the Vesuvius Challenge announced that three young students had won its $700,000 grand prize for using AI to help researchers read about 5% of another scroll, the subject of which was Greek Epicurean philosophy.",
      "The scroll that the team at the Bodleian Libraries recently unfurled is assumed to be on the same subject.",
      "\"I just love that connection with whoever collected them, whoever wrote them, whoever rolled those scrolls up and put them on the shelves,\" Nicole Gilroy, head of book conservation at the Bodleian Libraries, told the BBC. \"There's a real human aspect to it that I just think is really precious.\"",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Tourists continued to flee the Greek island of Santorini on Wednesday \u2014 a fourth consecutive day of exodus sparked by a series of earthquakes that have rattled the incredibly popular European vacation destination. Around 7,000 people have left the island, which sits southeast of Greece's mainland, since the\u00a0quakes began last week, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "Most of the visitors have left Santorini by ferry, but there have also been flights out.",
      "As of Tuesday, more than 1,000 earthquakes, with magnitudes up to 5.2 on the Richter scale, had been recorded near the island, most of them centered only about 15 miles from its shores in the Aegean Sea, according to the Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Centre.",
      "Efthimios Lekkas, head of the state-run Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization, told Greek national television that the earthquakes were moving north, away from the island, according to The Associated Press.",
      "\"This may last several days or several weeks,\" he said. \"We are not able to predict the evolution of the sequence in time.\"",
      "It is that unpredictability of earthquakes that has driven people away from the island \u2014 nobody can say for sure whether the hundreds of small quakes mean a bigger temblor is on the way.",
      "\"I understand the fear of what it means at the moment to be on a Santorini that is constantly moving,\" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said, urging residents to stay calm and follow any instructions provided by officials.",
      "Experts told the French news agency AFP the region had not experienced such intense seismic activity since records began in 1964.",
      "Santorini sits atop a volcano that has not erupted since 1950, but a committee of experts said Monday that the current rash of quakes was \"not linked to volcanic activity.\"",
      "\"It's different this time\"",
      "While the earthquakes have left cracks in some buildings, no substantial damage or injuries have been reported. The neighboring islands of Anafi, Ios and Amorgos have also reported no casualties.",
      "Schools on all four islands have also been closed for the week as a precaution, and Santorini has cancelled public events and restricted arrivals to the island.",
      "About 3.4 million people visited Santorini in 2023, according to the AFP.",
      "Panagiotis Hatzigeorgiou, a retired police officer and ship worker who has lived on the island for over 30 years, told the AP he wouldn't be leaving, despite invites to stay with relatives in the Greek capital, Athens.",
      "\"Older residents are used to the earthquakes,\" he said. \"But it's different this time. It's not the same to have earthquakes every two to three minutes.\"",
      "\"The main thing is not to worry,\" he said, adding with a laugh: \"Now we can listen to music alone and have coffee by ourselves.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 08:53:13 -0500",
    "summary": "Officials in Sweden have vowed to determine why a man killed 10 people, and apparently himself, in an unprecedented attack that's shaken their \"society to its core.\"",
    "story": [
      "Orebro, Sweden \u2014 Sweden's worst-ever mass shooting left at least 11 people dead on Tuesday, including the gunman, and at least five seriously wounded at an adult education center west of Stockholm. The gunman's motive hadn't been determined by early Wednesday as the Scandinavian nation \u2014 where gun violence at schools is very rare \u2014 reeled from an attack with such bloodshed that police early on said it was difficult to count the number of dead among the carnage.",
      "Police chief Roberto Eid Forest, for the city of Orebro, about 100 miles west of Stockholm, where the tragedy played out, said Wednesday there was \"a lot to indicate that\" the gunman had shot himself, saying he was found already dead when police reached him.",
      "Officials said Wednesday that three women and two men, all with gunshot wounds, had undergone surgery at Orebro University Hospital. All were in serious but stable condition after being admitted to the hospital with life-threatening injuries. Another woman was treated for minor injuries and was stable.",
      "Jonas Claesson, regional director of health and medical services, said that two of the gunshot victims were in intensive care Wednesday. All the victims are over the age of 18, officials said. No other patients related to the shooting were admitted to Orebro University Hospital overnight.",
      "The school, called Campus Risbergska, offers primary and secondary educational classes for adults age 20 and older, Swedish-language classes for immigrants, vocational training and programs for people with intellectual disabilities. The school is on the outskirts of Orebro, which is about 125 miles west of Stockholm.",
      "Justice Minister Gunnar Str\u00f6mmer called the shooting \"an event that shakes our entire society to its core.\" King Carl XVI Gustaf and Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at the Royal Palace and government buildings.",
      "The king and Queen Silvia were in Orebro and would visit the school district and attend a memorial service in the city, the palace said. Kristersson and Str\u00f6mmer would also be there. Soccer teams Degerfors IF and Orebro Syrianska will wear black armbands at a preseason match on Wednesday evening and hold a minute's silence before kickoff, Degerfors said.",
      "The shooting started Tuesday afternoon after many students had gone home following a national exam. Students sheltered in nearby buildings, and other parts of the school were evacuated following the shooting.",
      "Eid Forest, head of the local police, said the school's large premises meant it took a long time for officers to search the campus to ensure there were not any more victims. Police heard gunshots when they arrived and initially thought they were being fired upon, he said.",
      "Eid Forest said six officers were treated for smoke inhalation. There wasn't a fire, he said, and authorities didn't immediately know what caused the smoke.",
      "Investigators will spend Wednesday seeking information from witnesses and checking any video of the attack. Police wouldn't say whether the shooter had multiple guns.",
      "There were no warnings beforehand, and police believe the perpetrator acted alone. Police haven't said if the man was a student at the school. They haven't released a possible motive, but authorities said there were no suspected connections to terrorism at this point.",
      "Police raided the suspect's home after Tuesday's shooting, but it wasn't immediately clear what they found. They cautioned the public against spreading incorrect narratives on social media.",
      "\"Today, we have witnessed brutal, deadly violence against completely innocent people,\" the prime minister told reporters in Stockholm late Tuesday. \"This is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history. Many questions remain unanswered, and I cannot provide those answers either.",
      "\"But the time will come when we will know what happened, how it could occur, and what motives may have been behind it. Let us not speculate,\" he said.",
      "While gun violence at schools is very rare in Sweden, people were wounded or killed with other weapons such as knives or axes in several incidents in recent years.",
      "Gun ownership is legal in Sweden, but the country's\u00a0laws on firearms\u00a0are strict, with \"the right to possess weapons, even for protection purposes,\" requiring a license granted only with explicit permission from the police force, which must be applied for in advance of any intended purchase.",
      "Licensed gun owners must carry their documentation with them at all times when in possession of firearms, and the country's laws cover not only guns but weapons that fire or deploy tear gas.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 08:42:53 -0500",
    "summary": "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said.",
    "story": [
      "A colossal explosion in the sky, unleashing energy hundreds of times greater than the Hiroshima bomb. A blinding flash nearly as bright as the sun. Shockwaves powerful enough to flatten everything for miles.",
      "It may sound apocalyptic, but a newly detected asteroid nearly the size of a football field now has a greater than one percent chance of colliding with Earth in about eight years.",
      "Such an impact has the potential for city-level devastation, depending on where it strikes.",
      "Scientists aren't panicking yet, but they are watching closely.",
      "\"At this point, it's 'Let's pay a lot of attention, let's get as many assets as we can observing it,'\" Bruce Betts, chief scientist of The Planetary Society, told AFP.",
      "What we know 2024 YR4 and its chances of hitting Earth",
      "Dubbed 2024 YR4, the asteroid was first spotted on December 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.",
      "By New Year's Eve, it had landed on the desk of Kelly Fast, acting planetary defense officer at US space agency NASA, as an object of concern.",
      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on January 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a 1.6% chance the asteroid will strike Earth on December 22, 2032.",
      "The asteroid 2024 YR4 is now rated at Level 3 out of 10 on the\u00a0Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is \"a close encounter\" that warrants attention from astronomers and the public.",
      "If it does hit, possible impact sites include over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia, the IAWN memo states.",
      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth -- its next close pass will not come until 2028.",
      "\"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero,\" said Betts.",
      "A similar scenario unfolded in 2004 with Apophis, an asteroid initially projected to have a 2.7 percent chance of striking Earth in 2029. Further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "\"City killer\" category",
      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75 percent of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT -- more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "The good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft -- a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",
      "\"I don't see why it wouldn't work\" again, he said. The bigger question is whether major nations would fund such a mission if their own territory was not under threat.",
      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",
      "Lasers could vaporize part of the asteroid to create a thrust effect, pushing it off course. A \"gravity tractor,\" a large spacecraft that slowly tugs the asteroid away using its own gravitational pull, has also been theorized.",
      "If all else fails, the long warning time means authorities could evacuate the impact zone.",
      "\"Nobody should be scared about this,\" said Fast. \"We can find these things, make these predictions and have the ability to plan.\"",
      "Still, NASA tracks close approaches and calculates the odds of those space rocks \u2014 including asteroids, meteors and meteorites \u2014 impacting Earth.",
      "\"The majority of near-Earth objects have orbits that don't bring them very close to Earth, and therefore pose no risk of impact, but a small fraction of them \u2013 called potentially hazardous asteroids \u2013 require more attention,\"\u00a0according to\u00a0the website of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the center dedicated to studying near-Earth objects for NASA.",

      "The saint was more recently adopted by Ecuadoran traffickers and hitmen in Duran \u2014 a city overrun by drug gangs that extort and terrorize locals.",
      "In addition to making offerings at altars, gang members tattoo the saint's likeness on their arms and wear amulets bearing her image around their necks.",
      "Santamaria said Santa Muerte came over from Mexico about six years ago when members of the Ecuadoran gang Los Choneros received training from the infamous Sinaloa cartel, which also transferred its otherworldly beliefs.",
      "Police in Duran estimate they had found altars to the saint in about six out of every 10 busts carried out in 2024.",
      "Los Choneros is one of 20 criminal gangs declared \"terrorist groups\" by Ecuadoran President Daniel Noboa, seeking re-election Sunday as he leads a war on drug gangs blamed for a surge in violent crime in the once-peaceful South American country.",
      "Just last week, a leader of one of Ecuador's biggest crime syndicates, Los Lobos, was\u00a0arrested at his home\u00a0in the coastal city of Portoviejo. The\u00a0U.S. last year declared Los Lobos\u00a0to be the largest drug trafficking organization in Ecuador.",
      "Noboa has declared a state of emergency and deployed troops in the streets and violence-riddled prisons, resulting in a slight dip in homicide rates in 2024 from the previous year. The president took action last year after gunmen stormed and opened fire\u00a0in a TV studio and bandits threatened random executions of civilians and security forces. A prosecutor investigating the assault was later\u00a0shot dead.",
      "Officers scared to work around the altars",
      "Duran and the nearby city of Guayaquil are at the epicenter of Ecuador's violence, due in part to their proximity to the port increasingly used to send cocaine to Europe and the United States from neighbors Peru and Colombia \u2014 the world's top producers of the drug.",
      "Like Mexico, Ecuador is a largely Catholic country, and the Church condemns the practice of portraying death as a personality like in the case of Santa Muerte.",
      "However, most Ecuadorans have no problem reconciling the two, and Santa Muerte is being adopted by broader society as well, with depictions sold at markets or even online.",
      "This has prompted observers to worry that people with Santa Muerte items in their possession may be wrongly labeled gangsters amid the government crackdown.",

      "\"I think we are seeing more artists shift to country from both a fiscal and cultural lens. From a financial standpoint, country music audiences are some of the most loyal listeners, and the genre still somewhat prioritizes more financially beneficial dissemination methods like album sales and radio play, as opposed to other genres that almost wholly rely on streaming.

Nonetheless, considering that she has yet to release her re-recording of her debut album, I could see a country album or tracks naturally following its release. This would align with both her musical evolution and her penchant for revisiting and revitalizing her earlier work. A return to country music would not only be a nod to her origins but also a strategic embrace of the genre\u2019s current resurgence in mainstream popularity. Whether this speculation comes to fruition remains to be seen, but it\u2019s certainly within the realm of possibility for an artist known for both her musical versatility and her strategic career moves.\""

It has been absolutely ridiculous that you've had girls work their whole lives, set goals, work hard only for some boy to come along and snatch their dreams away from them.

      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt tells reporters that the U.S. has begun flying migrant criminals to Guantanamo Bay on Feb. 4, 2025.",
      "The Trump administration's plan to detain some of the most dangerous illegal immigrants arrested in the United States in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, could raise legal concerns and challenges, which could slow efforts to deport them to their home countries, experts say.",
      "President Donald Trump has instructed the Pentagon to prepare the facility to house up to 30,000 \"criminal illegal aliens\" at the U.S. military base. Flights to the facility began this week.",
      "Around 150 Marines are at the Naval Station and have set up tents for around 1,000 migrants in the other part of the installation. But those facilities with latrines and showers are not yet ready for an onslaught of 30,000 migrants as promised by Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",

      "A migrant prepares to board a flight to Guantanamo Bay. The detention of illegal immigrants at Guantanamo could raise legal challenges, experts say.\u00a0 (Department of Homeland Security)",
      "Among the uncertainties of the plan, what's inevitable is that those detained will most likely file petitions for a writ of habeas corpus, which asks a judge to review the legality of the prisoner's detention, said Eugene Fidell, a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School who teaches a course on military law and Guantanamo Bay.",
      "\"Nothing has changed in terms of that basic guideline, which means that the writ of habeas corpus, which is protected by the U.S. Constitution in so many words, applies there,\" Fidell told Fox News. \"And what that means is that the people who are being taken to Guantanamo as part of the administration's current effort are going to have access to the United States District Court.\"",
      "The first 10 criminal migrants who arrived this week will be held under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) control in a separate wing of the detention facility where the 15 remaining 9/11 military combatants, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the principal architect of the 9/11 terror attack, are housed.",

      "\"Unauthorized immigrants transferred (or threatened with potential transfer) from the United States to Guant\u00e1namo will file a vast array of legal challenges, providing a lot of business for the courts,\" he wrote in an article published Tuesday. \"Haitian and Cuban refugees previously held on Guant\u00e1namo\u2014as well as many of the terrorism suspects\u2014filed numerous suits challenging the detention and conditions, several of which were ultimately heard by the Supreme Court.\"",

      "\"Here's what we know. What President Trump knows is that border security and internal enforcement is national security. Because we were invaded for the last four years under Joe Biden,\" Hegseth added. \"Tens of millions of people entered our country. We have no idea who they are. We're going to find those here illegally, prioritizing those with violent or sketchy past and use Guantanamo Bay as a transit way to remove them and send them back to their home country.\"",
      "Bellinger noted that all the prior cases by those detained at Guantanamo involved people detained outside the U.S. Those arrested in the U.S. will be able to file additional claims, he said.",
      "\"Unauthorized immigrants detained in the United States also have a right to counsel and to be visited by a consular official from their country of nationality,\" he said. \"Such immigrants may claim that their transfer to Guantanamo will interfere with their ability to exercise these rights.\"",

      "In 2008, a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision gave anyone sent to Gitmo the right to habeas corpus, meaning anyone at Guantanamo can challenge the legality of their detention. The ruling has played a factor that has slowed the government's ability to complete the prosecution of Mohammed and the other 9/11 planners.",
      "\"This is not a convenient venue,\" said Fidell. \"It's not a venue that insulates the government's activities from the oversight of the federal courts.\"",
      "Fidell noted that previous administrations have resisted efforts to get the federal court to exercise oversight of Guantanamo, resulting in a series of court cases, notably the U.S. Supreme Court case of Zadvydas v. Davis, noting that those cases dealing with the indefinite detention of illegal immigrants could apply.",
      "\"What you're going to see is an intersection of habeas corpus law generally with the very robust body of law that has grown up over the years in the immigration field,\" he said. \"And the notion that people can be held for prolonged periods of time is one that I think is going to meet with a lot of resistance in the courts.\"",

Zadvydas was born to\u00a0Lithuanian\u00a0parents in\u00a0Germany, but was not a citizen of either country, neither of which would accept him.",
      "In 1995, he filed a petition for a writ of\u00a0habeas corpus\u00a0in\u00a0a federal court, which was eventually granted and he was released under supervision. The government appealed and the ruling was overturned.",
      "From 1991 to 1993 and from 1994 to 1996, part of the base at Guantanamo was used to house large numbers of Haitians and Cubans who fled their countries on boats and rafts to claim asylum in the U.S.",

      "In addition to legal challenges that could slow the deportation process, housing these migrants could cost taxpayers millions of dollars.",
      "\"There's a theatrical dimension to this. But this is it. This is an operetta for which the seats are extremely expensive,\" Fidell said. \"We know that it is costing the taxpayers a fortune to keep Guantanamo open for the handful of people being tried by the military commission, as well as the even smaller handful of people who are simply being held pending repatriation or being sent somewhere that will accept them who are long-term detainees.\"",
      "\"Congress is going to have to appropriate some money because it's not going to be free for the taxpayers,\" he added. \"I think this is a battle that's going to be fought out not at Guantanamo. It's going to be fought out at John Marshall Place in Washington, D.C., where the federal court sits.\"",

      "Scientists from Germany's universities of Stuttgart and Freiburg have developed what is known as the\u00a0Solar Gate window facade system. It's like having tiny pinecones built right into your windows. These smart windows have special elements that curl up when it's cool and moist, letting in sunlight to warm your home. But when it's hot and dry, they flatten out to block the sun and keep things cool inside.",

      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "How it works",
      "The Solar Gate system consists of a gridded array of pine-cone-scale-inspired self-bending elements housed between two panes of glass in an aluminum-frame window unit. Each element is ingeniously crafted with three distinct layers, each serving a unique purpose. The bottom layer is composed of a cellulose powder and a thermoplastic blend that swells when exposed to moisture. Above this lies a middle layer made of thermoplastic, which remains unaffected by moisture.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The top layer consists of flexible biocomposite filaments that serve to hold the entire structure together. When exposed to moist air, the bottom layer expands, causing the element to curl upwards. Conversely, in dry conditions, it returns to its flattened state. This simple yet effective mechanism allows the window to respond automatically to changing weather conditions, providing optimal shading and light penetration as needed.",

In a comprehensive year-long study, researchers installed 424 Solar Gate elements in the south-facing skylight of a research building at the University of Freiburg. The results of this extensive trial were nothing short of impressive.",
      "During the cool, wet winter months, the elements responded by curling upwards, allowing ample sunlight to penetrate the building. This natural response effectively warmed and illuminated the interior spaces, reducing the need for artificial heating and lighting. Conversely, as the seasons changed and brought warmer, drier summer conditions, the elements automatically flattened out.",
      "This flattening action served to block excess sunlight, effectively keeping the building's interior cool and comfortable without the need for energy-intensive air conditioning. The test demonstrated the system's ability to autonomously adapt to changing weather conditions, providing optimal comfort and energy efficiency throughout the year.",

      "Those of us old enough to remember traveling before the age of smartphones and mobile internet know we have it pretty good these days. You can find the best flights using comparison sites, choose among hundreds of hotels on a single booking site, get tickets sent to your phone rather than picking them up in person, check in online, order a ride and you\u2019re off.",
      "All this, of course, comes with downsides and trade-offs.",
      "Most people\u2019s biggest concerns are \"getting hacked,\" which, when you get down to it, really means \"being robbed in ways I don\u2019t quite understand.\" But that\u2019s one of those risks that, although very real, is unlikely to happen if you take the usual precautions.",

      "Avoiding cruise lines and booking sites altogether is hardly a practical solution when you need to book a cruise or accommodation. Here are some things you can do to dramatically reduce the risk when booking flights, cruises, vehicles and accommodation.",
      "1. Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Use personal security caution: Don't sign in to anything using your social media accounts. Sign in with your email instead and be sure to use an email address you've set aside just for these kinds of situations.",
      "3. Do your homework online: Do an online search for the booking website, cruise line or travel agency in question, keeping an eye out for any recent reports of scams or other issues.",
      "4. Check company reputation carefully:\u00a0Check\u00a0ClassAction.org, the\u00a0Better Business Bureau and\u00a0Trustpilot specifically. This will help you gain comprehensive insights into a company's track record, customer experiences and potential issues.",
      "5. Verify communication legitimacy: Whenever you receive a call, email or text message from a booking service, confirm that it's really them by first checking your account directly and then contacting the company through official, publicly listed channels (not social media).",

      "More ways to protect yourself online when traveling: Here's how to stay safe",
      "Here are some of the \"usual precautions\" that can protect you from \"getting hacked\" while traveling.",
      "1. Update all your apps and operating systems before heading off: All those security patches are that much more important while you're traveling. You'll want to download and install all pending updates at least 24-48 hours before your departure, ensuring you have the latest security protections and giving yourself time to troubleshoot any potential update-related issues that might arise.",
      "2. Lock everything down: Use strong, unique passwords and a reliable\u00a0password manager to keep track of them.",
      "3. Turn on two-factor authentication where available: Prioritize using authenticator apps over SMS-based codes. This provides a more secure second layer of verification, as authenticator apps are less vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks and interception compared to text message-based authentication. Choose\u00a0reputable authenticator apps, which generate time-based one-time passwords that change frequently and are tied directly to your device.",
      "4. Keep location services turned off: NFC, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi should also be turned off while you\u2019re not using them. That\u2019ll make your battery last longer as a side benefit.",
      "5. Go dark: Don\u2019t publicly share news of your trip until you\u2019re back. Avoid posting about your vacation on social media or keeping a blog about your adventures, as this information can be used by criminals to piece together a snapshot of your life.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "6. Limit social media use:\u00a0Scammers and hackers often exploit social media to gather personal information and target travelers. To stay secure, avoid sharing trip details publicly and use a privacy-focused messaging app like\u00a0Signal to stay in touch with family and friends.",
      "7. Use privacy-focused browsers:\u00a0You should consider using browsers like\u00a0Brave or Firefox with privacy extensions. Enabling \"do not track\" settings and utilizing private/incognito mode can provide an extra layer of digital protection.",
      "8. Disable automatic Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections: Disable settings that automatically connect to networks and manually select and verify networks before connecting. This prevents your device from inadvertently joining potentially unsecured networks.",
      "9. Use encrypted messaging and email: Protect your private communications by using services that offer end-to-end encryption for both\u00a0messaging and\u00a0email. These platforms ensure your data remains secure from unauthorized access, with features like encryption for non-users, multifactor authentication and tracking protection.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "10. Travel with minimal digital gear: Consider bringing a \"travel-only\" phone or laptop with minimal personal data.",
      "11. Be cautious of public charging stations: Avoid using\u00a0public USB charging ports that could potentially\u00a0compromise your device. Instead, carry a\u00a0portable phone charger with you.",
      "12. Monitor your accounts: Set up transaction alerts on financial accounts and use credit cards with strong fraud protection. Regularly check your accounts while traveling to quickly detect any suspicious activity.",
      "13. Bring your own internet access with you: Find a\u00a0local or international SIM, a\u00a0mobile hot spot and a trusted\u00a0VPN (virtual private network) service for those times you can\u2019t help but use public Wi-Fi. Using a VPN can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

To really stay safe, though, it\u2019s important to start thinking about your data privacy and data security before even booking your trip.

      "Whoosh isn't your typical gondola or cable car system. While it may look similar at first glance, this clever Kiwi invention offers a unique blend of on-demand service, direct routing and privacy that sets it apart from traditional public transportation. Unlike fixed-route gondolas, Whoosh pods are equipped with their own motors and autonomous navigation systems. This allows them to freely traverse a complex network of cables and rails, choosing the most efficient path from one point to another without intermediate stops.",

      "The Whoosh system combines the best aspects of ride-sharing and public transport. Users can book a pod through an app, much like calling an Uber. The pod will be waiting at a nearby station, ready to whisk you away to your destination. These stations are designed with minimal footprint, fitting into a standard car park space and featuring a spiral ramp up to the network height of about 40 feet above the ground. Larger stations can be built at ground level, offering easy access for passengers.",
      "The network itself consists of tensioned cables spanning 500-985 feet, interspersed with shorter sections of steel rail for smooth turns and junctions. This design allows Whoosh to overcome geographical obstacles with ease, crossing rivers, highways or even connecting rooftops.",

      "THE BEST TRAVEL GEAR FOR 2025",
      "Speed, efficiency and comfort",
      "Whoosh pods are expected to achieve an average speed of 25 mph across the network. While this may not sound impressive at first, the non-stop nature of the journey means it could be significantly faster than driving through congested urban areas. The system features remarkable efficiency, using less energy for a standard ride than a 10-minute shower. This is achieved through constant motion and low rolling resistance, making Whoosh about twice as efficient as a small electric car. Comfort hasn't been overlooked either. The pods can lean into corners, much like a motorcycle, providing a smooth ride even at higher speeds. The cable sections of the journey offer an especially pleasant \"floating\" sensation.",

This picturesque tourist destination, with its challenging geography and traffic issues, provides an ideal testing ground for the technology. Nestled between mountains and a lake, Queenstown suffers from limited road networks and significant traffic congestion, making it a perfect proving ground for Whoosh's innovative transportation solution. The pilot project will demonstrate the system's ability to navigate difficult terrain and provide efficient transit in a compact urban environment, with Chris Allington noting that the location is \"small enough that it's actually solvable\" while presenting unique geographical challenges.",

      "If a social media ad is offering free NFL tickets or merchandise, there is a catch. These scams appear everywhere, promising fans exclusive giveaways if they cover a small shipping fee or provide personal details. The posts look official, sometimes even using fake endorsements from players or teams, making them easy to fall for.",
      "Scammers also use cross-platform operations to evade detection and bans by social media platforms. They will identify and initiate communications with you on one social media platform before requesting you switch to another. This is likely an attempt to prevent one social media platform from gaining full insight into fraudulent activity and banning accounts.",
      "The moment you enter your information or payment details, you have handed cybercriminals access to your bank account. And those free tickets or jerseys never arrive. Scammers rely on the excitement of game day to push people into acting without thinking. The truth is simple. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.",
      "Scam tactic #5: Offering massive discounts",
      "Finally, scammers may offer massive discounts for Super Bowl tickets to entice you to buy quickly. They may state they just want to sell the tickets \"last minute\" to justify large, attractive discounts, such as 50% off or more. They may also claim to have a personal or professional reason for not being able to attend the event, such as a family emergency or a work conflict. Scammers often use these excuses to pressure victims into making hasty decisions and transferring money without verifying the tickets.",

      "MOST TALKED ABOUT SUPER BOWL ADS",
      "Safeguarding your Super Bowl experience from cyber threats",
      "While scammers will try to prey on Super Bowl fans, you are not completely helpless. Dave Lewis, Global Advisory CISO at\u00a01Password, shared some tips on staying safe leading up to the games. These are not complicated strategies, just simple cybersecurity practices that are easy to follow.",
      "1) Buy tickets from trusted sources:\u00a0Only purchase from official sites/apps and other reputable channels. Double-check URLs to avoid lookalike sites (which are designed to mimic legitimate event pages). Platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Eventbrite and Nextdoor are also hot spots for scams, so be cautious of sellers \"requiring a deposit\" through peer-to-peer financial apps like Cash App, Venmo or Zelle.",
      "2) Watch out for event-related phishing attacks: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Cybercriminals often time their phishing attacks around large events like the Super Bowl, offering fake discount tickets, VIP experiences, free food vouchers, etc. Always verify offers through the event\u2019s official website or app and never agree to anything over the phone. Double-check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over links before clicking to ensure they lead to legitimate event sites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Keep your phone software and apps updated:\u00a0Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system (i.e., iOS, macOS, Windows, Android, others). \"While constant notifications can be an annoyance at the moment, these updates are essential for keeping your devices secure,\" Lewis said. If you\u2019re not sure how to get started,\u00a0check out this extensive guide on how to update all your devices.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Create complex passwords for all your accounts, especially those related to ticket purchases or event information. Use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store these securely. Enable\u00a02FA wherever possible, particularly for email and payment accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. For the Super Bowl, this is especially crucial for any official NFL or ticketing apps you might be using.",
      "5) Be wary of QR codes:\u00a0While convenient, QR codes can be exploited by hackers for malicious purposes. Only scan QR codes from trusted sources, such as the official event organizer. If unsure, check for signs of tampering, like stickers placed over legitimate codes or poor print quality. When in doubt, don\u2019t scan it. As a precaution, always keep your antivirus software running to prevent malware infections from scanning a scam QR code.\u00a0If you don\u2019t have antivirus software, check out my top recommendations here.",
      "6) Beware of scammers using social engineering techniques: For example, they may encourage you to transfer money immediately as they allegedly have other prospective buyers. They may also use emotional appeals, such as sympathy, guilt or urgency, to manipulate you into making a decision. Scammers often use these tactics to pressure victims into paying before verifying the tickets.",
      "7) Be wary of individuals showing receipts or proof of purchase: This is not a guarantee that an individual is in possession of a ticket, and it can be easily faked.\u00a0Scammers can use fake receipts to convince victims that they bought the tickets from legitimate sources, such as Ticketmaster, StubHub or SeatGeek.",
      "8) Exercise caution when interacting with individuals asking for you to \"name your price\" or are selling below ticket value: This may be a sign that they are trying to lure you into a scam with a too-good-to-be-true offer. Scammers often use this strategy to attract victims who are looking for cheap or affordable tickets.",
      "9)\u00a0Be cautious when interacting with people claiming to sell tickets on behalf of a friend or family member: This may provide an excuse for scammers using compromised bank accounts with the account holder's name different from the social media account being used. Scammers often use this pretext to explain the discrepancy between the names on the accounts.",
      "10)\u00a0Review the account\u2019s recent history: Some scammers may claim to be selling tickets to multiple high-profile events, such as sports games, music concerts and conferences at one time. This may indicate that they are running a large-scale scam operation and are not genuine sellers. Scammers often post multiple ads for different events on the same or different platforms, using the same or similar images and descriptions.",
      "11) Exercise caution and validate ownership: Do this even when purchasing items from friends or friends of friends on social media. A family member or friend\u2019s account can be compromised and used by a scammer. Friends of the victim can vouch for the account user as a legitimate seller, not realizing the account had been hacked.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers are always looking for new ways to take advantage of football fans, especially during major events like the Super Bowl. Whether it is fake ticket sales, phishing scams or bogus giveaways, the risks are real. You can easily avoid becoming a victim of these types of attacks by staying vigilant and being cautious of emails and links that ask for personal information.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says cybercriminals are exploiting iMessage phishing protection, tricking users to reactivate links.",
      "Elon Musk, known for leading companies like Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and xAI and buying and rebranding Twitter as X, often finds his name linked to innovation and futuristic ideas. But his reputation also makes him a prime target for scammers.",
      "In the past, fraudsters have used Musk\u2019s name in cryptocurrency schemes. Now, a new scam is making the rounds. This time, scammers are promoting bogus \"energy-saving\" devices, falsely associating Musk with these products to gain credibility. These devices, which don\u2019t work as advertised, are being marketed as revolutionary solutions, duping people into spending money on what is essentially a scam.",
      "We received this email from Rick in Wilkesboro, North Carolina: \"I\u2019ve been receiving emails offering an energy-saving device developed by Elon Musk. It claims the device can reduce energy bills by 50%. I never attempted to contact anyone associated with Elon Musk, nor have I done any internet searches for such a device. Are these emails legit or another attempt by scammers hoping I click on their links?\"",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Rick, it sounds like those emails are likely scams. There have been numerous reports of scammers using Elon Musk's name to promote fake energy-saving devices. These scams often claim that the device can drastically reduce energy bills, but there is no evidence that Elon Musk or any of his companies are involved in such products.",
      "Let's dive into how this scam works and share some ways you can stay safe.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does Elon Musk's energy-saving scam work?",
      "The Elon Musk energy-saving scam works by using flashy online ads, unsolicited emails and other deceptive tactics to lure victims. Scammers promote so-called \"revolutionary\" devices through social media, pop-ups, emails and even search engine ads, claiming the products are backed by Musk.",
      "These ads often include fake customer reviews, exaggerated claims of slashing electricity bills by 50% or more and time-limited discounts to create urgency. Names of devices advertised in these scams include the Power Pro Save, Heunwa Power Save, Stop Watt, Miracle Watt, True Watt, Real Watt, Watt Rescue, Esaver Watt, Pro Power Save, Voltmod and more.",
      "Clicking on these ads leads you to sales websites designed to look legitimate. They feature fake logos, doctored before-and-after photos and bogus celebrity endorsements to build trust. The sites throw around pseudo-scientific jargon like \"stabilizing electrical currents\" or \"rebalancing loads\" to sound convincing. They also use tactics like showing inflated \"regular\" prices crossed out to make the current offer seem like a huge bargain.",
      "If you look closely, though, the red flags are clear. These sites lack basic details like a company address, contact number or business registration information. Instead, they push you to place an order through an online form, demanding full payment upfront via credit card or PayPal.",
      "After paying, customers might receive a cheap, non-functional plastic device, or sometimes nothing at all. These devices don\u2019t reduce electricity usage. They might even waste more power. But by the time you realize it, the scammers have already pocketed your money.",
      "Elon Musk scam email ads (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DON\u2019T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "The truth about energy-saving devices",
      "Over the years, plenty of power-saving scams have promised to cut down or even eliminate your electricity bill by simply plugging in their devices. The reality is that there\u2019s no device you can plug in that will actually reduce your electricity usage or lower your household bill.",
      "These products often claim to \"stabilize voltage\" or \"reduce power waste.\" While voltage stabilization can be useful in industrial settings, it doesn\u2019t make much difference for typical home appliances. Most household appliances are already designed to run efficiently without the issues these devices claim to fix.",

      "10 ways to stay safe from such scams",
      "1. Verify the email: Phishing emails are a common tool scammers use to trick people into buying fake products or giving away personal information. These emails often look like they\u2019re from legitimate sources, but they contain links that lead to fraudulent websites or prompt you to download malicious attachments. Always check the sender's email address and look for signs of a fake message, like poor grammar or urgent calls to action.",
      "2. Verify claims: If you're curious about a product, do some research from reputable sources before taking any action.",
      "3. Do not click links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from these emails. Instead, hover over the link to see its true destination. This can help you identify if it leads to a legitimate site or a malicious one.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software actively running on your devices: Ensure you have reliable antivirus software installed on your devices. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses and other security threats. Regularly update the software to ensure it can detect and remove the latest threats. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Examine the website carefully: Scammers often create websites that look professional, but they\u2019re easy to spot with a few simple checks. Look for missing or suspicious information, like the absence of a business address, phone number or business registration details. If there are fake testimonials or celebrity endorsements, that\u2019s a red flag.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Don\u2019t fall for \"too good to be true\" deals:\u00a0Scammers rely on offering deals that seem too good to pass up, like massive discounts or a \"limited time offer.\" If an ad claims you can save 50% or more on a product, be skeptical. Real, quality products usually don\u2019t come with such extreme savings, and high-tech devices like those promoted by scammers rarely live up to the hype. If it feels like too good a deal, it probably is.",
      "7. Watch out for unusual payment methods: One of the easiest ways to spot a scam is by how the scammers ask you to pay. If a website asks for payment upfront via credit card or PayPal with no option to verify or ship the product first, it's a major red flag. Scammers take your money upfront and have no intention of sending you anything of value. Stick to reputable payment methods that offer buyer protection and avoid sites that ask for payment without proper verification.",
      "8. Mark spam email as junk or spam: Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "9. Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources: This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable email or email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "10. Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Impersonation scams are a common way scammers steal your money. They often use well-known names like Elon Musk or big companies like Microsoft and Walmart to make you trust them, then trick you into giving away your financial details. To stay safe, avoid unsolicited emails or texts that promote products or offers. If you need to buy something, stick to trusted sellers like Amazon, Best Buy or other reputable platforms.

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 10:00:50 -0500",
    "summary": "Hackers sometimes find ways to exploit iPhones, and Apple recently discovered a vulnerability in iOS that may have been exploited for over a year.",
    "story": [
      "Tool transforms simple text prompts into images or animations in seconds.",
      "Generally, iPhones are considered more secure than Android devices.",
      "Apple\u2019s closed ecosystem and strict App Store policies limit the risk of malware, and its centralized software updates ensure better security. In contrast, Android\u2019s openness allows users to install apps from various sources, and updates are often rolled out at different times, making it more vulnerable to attacks.",
      "However, iPhones aren\u2019t immune to security flaws. Hackers occasionally find ways to exploit them, as seen in Apple\u2019s latest advisory. The company recently discovered that a vulnerability in iOS had been exploited for over a year. While a fix has now been released, reports suggest that hackers may have already targeted high-value individuals.",

      "A woman on her iPhone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Apple has\u00a0uncovered hackers exploiting a vulnerability in iOS that appears to have been lingering for more than a year. The vulnerability is a \"zero-day\" flaw, meaning criminals may have already exploited it, according to the latest security advisory from the company. Zero-day flaws like this are especially dangerous because they are exploited before developers can issue fixes. Apple confirmed this marks its first zero-day patch of 2025. The vulnerability affects iPhones dating back to 2018\u2019s XS model, as well as newer iPads, Macs, and even the Vision Pro headset.",
      "The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24085, resides in Apple\u2019s Core Media framework, a software layer responsible for processing multimedia files. A \"use after free\" memory corruption error enabled hackers to manipulate the system into executing unstable code, granting them elevated privileges to bypass security protocols. Apple\u2019s advisory suggests hackers weaponized the flaw through malicious apps disguised as legitimate media players. These apps likely abused the Core Media framework by triggering corrupted files, enabling attackers to infiltrate devices.",
      "The attacks reportedly targeted iOS versions predating 17.2, released in December 2023, meaning the vulnerability may have been active since late 2022. Security experts speculate that hackers focused on high-value individuals \u2014 such as activists, executives or journalists \u2014 to avoid detection. The prolonged stealth of the campaign underscores the challenges of identifying sophisticated, narrowly tailored exploits.",

      "1. Keep your iPhone updated:\u00a0I can\u2019t say this enough.\u00a0Updating your iPhone regularly is one of the most effective ways to protect it from security threats. Apple frequently releases updates that fix vulnerabilities, including critical zero-day flaws.",
      "2. Download apps only from the App Store: To minimize the risk of installing malware, only download apps from the official App Store. Apple\u2019s strict app review process helps prevent malicious apps from being published, but some threats can still slip through. Always verify app details, check reviews and be cautious about app permissions before installation.",
      "3. Enable lockdown mode for extra protection: For those of you who may be at higher risk, such as journalists or executives,\u00a0Lockdown Mode provides an additional layer of security. This feature limits certain device functionalities to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks. It can be turned on via\u00a0Settings >\u00a0Privacy & Security >\u00a0Lockdown Mode and is especially useful for those concerned about targeted threats.",
      "4. Enable message filtering: Use your device's built-in filtering options to sort messages from unknown senders. This feature allows you to automatically sort messages from unknown senders, easily filter unread messages\u00a0and manage your message inbox more efficiently. Here are steps:",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Stay cautious of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0Phishing remains one of the most common tactics used by hackers. Be cautious when receiving unsolicited messages or emails on your iPhone, especially those with suspicious links or attachments. Always verify the sender before opening anything. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Review your security and privacy settings: Regularly reviewing your iPhone\u2019s security settings can help you maintain strong protection. You should also review app permissions in\u00a0Settings > Privacy & Security to restrict access to sensitive data, such as location or contacts. Enable\u00a0Face ID or Touch ID for secure access and turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) for Apple ID and other accounts.\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message or authentication app, in addition to your password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: By reducing your online footprint, you make it harder for cybercriminals to obtain your contact information, potentially preventing them from sending you deceptive phishing texts and emails in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "This iOS vulnerability is a serious reminder of the importance of staying up to date with software updates. If you\u2019re using an iPhone from 2018 or later, make sure you\u2019ve updated to iOS 17.2 or later as soon as possible. Hackers exploited a hidden flaw for over a year, using fake media apps to gain access to devices. While Apple has now patched the issue, the fact that it remained undetected for so long is concerning.",

      "Syntilay, whose name is derived from \"scintillate\" (meaning to sparkle), is the brainchild of 25-year-old entrepreneur Ben Weiss. The company's journey from concept to creation is as unique as the shoes themselves. Using Midjourney AI, they generated the basic shape, which was then sketched by an artist. This sketch was transformed into a 3D model using Vizcom AI, and finally, generative AI added the distinctive patterns and textures.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Ben tells CyberGuy,\u00a0\"AI designing shoes is going to disrupt the category because of the incredible speed to go to market. New releases for traditionally made shoes take around 18 months for a model to release, with AI making them and 3D printing, that is now only a few months.\"",

      "These include the failure to address border security threats, insufficient leadership in recruitment and retention, mismanagement in acquiring key acquisitions such as icebreakers and helicopters, excessive focus on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and an \"erosion of trust\" over the mishandling and cover-up of Operation Fouled Anchor, which was the Coast Guard's internal investigation into sexual assault cases at the Coast Guard Academy.",

The official further cited inadequate accountability for acquisition failures that were highlighted during Trump's first administration.",
      "Fagan also prioritized DEI policies, including at the Coast Guard Academy, which diverted resources and focus from operational essentials.",

The Coast Guard did not disclose the existence of Operation Fouled Anchor until 2023, despite its existence from 2014 to 2019.",

      "Developed by the U.N.

      "He said that Hamas was \"a good example of where the absence of a definition is problematic because you get something like the 10/7 attack\u2026and the U.N. just completely failed in its response to that, and that is partly because of its failure to judge that a group that adopts terrorist tactics is a terrorist group.\"",

      "Among the signatories of the impeachment complaint was the president\u2019s son, Rep. Sandro Marcos, and cousin, House Speaker Martin Romualdez. The petition urged the Senate to shift itself into an impeachment court to try the vice president, \"render a judgement of conviction,\" remove her from office and ban her from holding public office.",
      "\"Duterte\u2019s conduct throughout her tenure clearly displays gross faithlessness against public trust and a tyrannical abuse of power that, taken together, showcases her gross unfitness to hold public office and her infidelity to the laws and the 1987 Constitution,\" the complaint said of Duterte.",
      "The vice president didn\u2019t immediately comment on the House decision to impeach her, but her brother, Rep. Paolo Duterte said that the move was \"a clear act of political persecution.\" Rival lawmakers maneuvered to quickly collect signatures and push a \"baseless impeachment case\" to the Senate, he said.",

      "The history of Gaza that Trump was referring to is both a long and tumultuous one.",

It was one of the five key cities of the Philistines, who arrived from the Aegean, known for their clashes with the Israelites. The story of Samson, who tore down a Philistine temple, is one of the earliest recorded tales of destruction and rebuilding in Gaza. Over centuries, it was conquered by the Egyptians, Babylonians and Persians, each bringing new rulers and forcing population shifts. Even then, Gaza was a land where people came and went, often not by choice.",
      "Under the Ottoman Empire (1517\u20131917), Gaza was a military stronghold. The Ottomans used it as a buffer zone, and while some periods saw growth, it was frequently abandoned during wars. In 1799, Napoleon\u2019s forces briefly occupied it before retreating. Once again, Gaza was left in ruins, and its population had to start over.",

They [the U.S.] are already there, and they can have more possibilities. And at the same time, we are willing to scale up from the Kingdom of Denmark. And I think NATO is the same. So if this is about securing our part of the world, we can find a way forward.\"",

      "\"You have to ask yourself, how are we going to solve that problem, solve our own national security if that means that we need to take more territorial interests in Greenland? That is what President Trump is going to do, because he doesn't care about what the Europeans scream at us. He cares about putting the interests of America's citizens first,\" Vance said, adding, \"You've got probably 55,000 people living on Greenland who are not actually happy with Danish government. They've got great natural resources there. They've got an incredibly bountiful country that the Danes aren't letting them develop and explore. Of course, Donald Trump would take a different approach if he was the leader of Greenland.\"",

      "Leiter, appearing on \"America's Newsroom\" last week, told Dana Perino that Iran would be front and center during the Trump-Netanyahu meeting. \"We will make the point that to allow Tehran to maintain its nuclear capabilities, which they can raise very quickly toward nuclear weapons, is simply unacceptable,\" he stated.",
      "Netanyahu was last at the White House on July 25, 2024, with then-President Biden having only invited the Israeli leader some 20 months after his re-election. This was widely viewed as a snub by Biden, whose party has increasingly distanced itself from traditional bipartisan support for the Jewish state.",
      "Netanyahu told reporters ahead of his departure that it was \"telling\" Trump chose to meet him first, describing it as \"a testimony to the strength of the American-Israeli alliance.\"",
      "\"This meeting will deal with important issues, critical issues facing Israel and our region, victory over Hamas, achieving the release of all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian terror axis and all its components \u2013 an axis that threatens the peace of Israel, the Middle East and the entire world,\" he said.",
      "There are currently 79 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including six dual US-Israeli citizens. \"Regarding agenda terms, Trump will want Netanyahu to proceed to the second phase of the truce agreement with Hamas. This is very difficult for Israel, since this basically leaves the terror group in power in Gaza,\" former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren told Fox News Digital.",

      "While Trump has said he was \"not confident\" the ceasefire deal would hold, his Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff visited Israel last week and reportedly pushed for the implementation of all three phases. According to Netanyahu, Trump has committed to supporting the resumption of the war if negotiations with Hamas prove \"futile.\"",
      "\"There may also be discussion about the future of the Palestinian issue and ways in which the Trump peace plan unveiled during his first term can be revived, as well as how a normalization push between Israel and Saudi Arabia can be concluded,\" Oren said. \"I think the major pressure point would be the \u2018P\u2019 word, which refers to the Saudis insisting on a pathway to Palestinian statehood. Parts of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition and even some within his own party will not discuss the \u2018P\u2019 word.\"",

      "The families of the four released hostages reunite with their daughters on Jan. 25, 2025. (IDF Spokesman' Unit)",
      "On this point, the two leaders may be aligned, with Trump insisting that Gaza be rebuilt \"in a different way.\" He also indicated his desire to relocate Gazans to Arab countries. \"You\u2019re talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out [Gaza] and say, \u2018You know, it\u2019s over,\u2019\" he said.",
      "During his first term, Trump pulled Washington out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, which was orchestrated by the Obama administration. However, the Biden administration undid most of Trump\u2019s \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Tehran \u2013 consisting primarily of crippling sanctions \u2013 by rehashing many Obama-era policies.",
      "\"I believe that Trump is prepared to immediately snap back paralyzing sanctions and issue a credible military threat to bring Iran back to the negotiating table for an agreement on its nuclear infrastructure, ballistic missile testing and terror financing,\" Danny Ayalon, former Israeli deputy foreign minister and ambassador to the U.S., told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"If not, the Iranians will be subject to a major operation that may be through an American-led coalition or different structures with or without Israel,\" he added, while referencing an Axios report last month that the U.S. president might \"either support an Israeli military strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities\u2026 or even order a U.S. strike.\" However, Ayalon said Trump will express a preference for a diplomatic solution, possibly placing him at odds with Netanyahu.",
      "BUSY WEEK AHEAD FOR TRUMP, CABINET PICKS",
      "Hamas terrorists watch on as four hostages are released to the Red Cross as part of a ceasefire deal with Israel. (TPS-IL)",
      "Ayalon also noted Netanyahu\u2019s appreciation for Trump\u2019s initiative to punish the International Criminal Court, which in November issued arrest warrants for the Israeli premier and then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over the prosecution of the war against Hamas, while suggesting that normalization between Jerusalem and Riyadh would be raised as part of a broader effort to reshape the Middle East.",
      "\"A potential economic corridor from Asia to Europe through Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan, maybe even the Palestinian Authority, works very well with Trump\u2019s agenda of countering aggressive Chinese expansionism through the Belt and Road Initiative,\" Ayalon said.",
      "Other agenda items might include a possible U.S.-backed push to apply Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank, also known by Israel as Judea and Samaria \u2013 a prospect Netanyahu shelved during Trump\u2019s first term in favor of forging the Abraham Accords \u2013 and expanding overall defense ties, including by advancing the American president\u2019s goal of developing an Iron Dome-like missile shield for the United States.",
      "\"It is very different from the Biden administration. Of course, it is more aggressive but that\u2019s only part of it. Trump sees the problem of Gaza in a wider perspective\" that includes the Saudis, Qataris, Egyptians and other regional players, Brig. Gen. (Res.) Hannan Gefen, the former commander of IDF's elite Unit 8200, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Trump, in his second term, is repeating his willingness to withdraw from the Kurdish-controlled northeastern part of Syria, which may contrast with Israel\u2019s interest,\" he explained. \"In Lebanon, there might be a disagreement if Israel sees Hezbollah [violating the ceasefire and] regaining power, and wants to strike terror bases. Regarding the Houthis in Yemen, Israel and the Saudis will try to direct Trump's policy to be more assertive than Biden was toward the Iranian proxy.\"",

      "Schools were closed and emergency crews deployed on the volcanic Greek island of Santorini on Monday after a spike in seismic activity raised concerns about a potentially powerful earthquake.",
      "Precautions were also ordered on several nearby Aegean Sea islands \u2014 all popular summer vacation destinations \u2014 after more than 200 undersea earthquakes were recorded in the area over the past three days.",
      "\"We have a very intense geological phenomenon to handle,\" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said from Brussels, where he was attending a European meeting. \"I want to ask our islanders first and foremost to remain calm, to listen to the instructions of the Civil Protection (authority).\"",

      "Mobile phones on the island blared with alert warnings about the potential for rockslides, while several earthquakes caused loud rumbles. Authorities banned access to some seaside areas, including the island's old port, that are in close proximity to cliffs.",
      "\"These measures are precautionary, and authorities will remain vigilant,\" Civil Protection Minister Vasilis Kikilias said late Sunday following an emergency government meeting in Athens. \"We urge citizens to strictly adhere to safety recommendations to minimize risk.\"",
      "While Greek experts say the quakes, many with magnitudes over 4.5, are not linked to Santorini\u2019s volcano, they acknowledge that the pattern of seismic activity is cause for concern.",

      "The frequency of the quakes, which continued throughout Sunday night and into Monday, has worried residents and visitors.",
      "\"I have never felt anything like this and with such frequency \u2014 an earthquake every 10 or 20 minutes.

      "\"We came out yesterday and performed. Despite the earthquakes, the philharmonic performed for a religious occasion,\" Gerontakis said. \"When you are playing, you cannot feel the quakes but there were earthquakes when we were at the church. No one can know what will happen. People can say whatever they like, but that has no value. You cannot contend with nature.\"",
      "Residents and visitors were advised to avoid large indoor gatherings and areas where rock slides could occur, while hotels were instructed to drain swimming pools to reduce potential building damage from an earthquake.",

      "Others said they were willing to take the risk. Restaurant worker Yiannis Fragiadakis had been away but said he returned to Santorini on Sunday despite the earthquakes.",
      "\"I wasn\u2019t afraid. I know that people are really worried and are leaving, and when I got to the port it was really busy, it was like the summer,\" Fragiadakis said. \"I plan to stay and hopefully the restaurant will start working (for the holiday season) in three weeks.\"",

      "\"We had dinner last night at the hotel and felt mild shakes about 10 times. But at midnight we felt a big one, a big shake, so I checked the news report. We are half-worried and half-looking to see what the situation is,\" she said, adding she didn't plan to change her travel plans.",

    "title": "Trump wants your attention \u2014 and the world's richest men can help him",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 10:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "When President Donald Trump was flanked at his inauguration by tech titans Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Sundar Pichai, with the CEOs of Apple and TikTok nearby, he was surrounded not just by a handful of the wealthiest men on the planet \u2014 but by executives who oversee platforms that, in some combination, virtually all Americans engage with.",

      "When President Donald Trump was flanked at his inauguration by tech titans Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Sundar Pichai, with the CEOs of Apple and TikTok nearby, he was surrounded not just by a handful of the wealthiest men on the planet \u2014 but by executives who oversee platforms that, in some combination, virtually all Americans engage with.",
      "For a president whose rise, fall and comeback are all intertwined with his innate ability to capture attention online and on TV, those executives hold the keys to algorithmic and policy tweaks that could depress or further enhance his political \u2014 and financial \u2014\u00a0standing. In turn, Trump could influence policy in emerging technologies in ways favorable or unfavorable to the executives and their companies, via his actions on domestic regulations and pressure on foreign governments to follow suit.",
      "The dynamic \u2014\u00a0which flows downstream from a rightward shift in Silicon Valley after the Covid pandemic \u2014\u00a0has the chance to reshape what was long an adversarial relationship between Trump-era conservatives and big tech companies, which has been marked by years of disdain over content moderation practices and threats to strip legal protections.",
      "Conservatives see a chance to advance their tech priorities on a host of fronts where they may not have seen possibilities before. But they say they still harbor skepticism of the platforms that recent policy shifts and photo-ops have not softened. For example, Steve Bannon, the influential former top White House aide under Trump, has continued to rail against the tech leaders and their agenda even as they become cozier with Trump.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said: \u201cOne of the reasons you see these guys now changing their tone on President Trump in particular is that they know how to read an election return. These guys are businesspeople. The attention economy is their business, and these are their consumers. And I think they can look at election returns and realize, \u2018Oh, gee, huh, this is where a majority of the public is.\u2019\u201d",
      "Hawley, who has challenged tech companies on antitrust grounds and data policy, among other areas, in the Senate, said their shift does not mean the right \u201cshould trust them and think: \u2018Oh, well, this is great. These guys have our best interest at heart. They have the best interest of the country at heart.\u2019",
      "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so for a second,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about their monopolistic power. That hasn\u2019t changed at all, their ability to turn right back on the control of news and information, their control over our personal data \u2014 none of that has changed. ... I think it\u2019s a good thing that through the election and through Trump\u2019s influence, they have changed their approach, currently, to political speech.",
      "\u201cDo I trust them to keep doing that? No, absolutely not,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I think that we should put the country in a position through antitrust legislation where they do not have the power to use their monopoly to squelch information, to control the flow of news, to use people\u2019s personal information without their consent.\u201d",
      "Democrats and liberal allies, meanwhile, are both trying to figure out how to swing the momentum in tech back toward them and expressing concern about what the new Trump-tech alliance could mean for everything from control of information online to wealth inequality and the nuts-and-bolts functions of government itself.",
      "\u201cI convened tech leaders over a year ago to discuss the rightward swing in Silicon Valley and the impact it would have,\u201d Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., whose district includes a slice of Silicon Valley, said in a statement. \u201cFor Democrats to win these leaders back, it is critical for us to prove we are the party of the future, of innovation, and of entrepreneurship. If we fail too, we miss an opportunity to harness tech for our vision and make incredible advancements in personalized medicine, efficient energy use, and building wealth in communities that have been left behind.\u201d",
      "\u2018They\u2019re not going to get anything from me\u2019",
      "For now, Republicans believe the relationship is to a large extent one-way: The tech companies are acquiescing to Trump without his having to give much of anything in return.",
      "Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said last week it would pay a $25 million settlement in a four-year-old lawsuit Trump filed over its move to suspend his accounts after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.",
      "Other recent moves by Meta included adding Republicans and Trump allies to its board and policy team and ending a fact-checking program and replacing it with a community-driven system similar to the one Musk has promoted at X. And Zuckerberg has repeatedly praised Trump since the 2024 election, even though Trump not long ago threatened him with a potential prison sentence.",
      "The company, however, has pushed back against claims that it is boosting Trump in its algorithms.",
      "Bezos\u2019 Amazon has announced it will release a Melania Trump documentary through its Amazon Prime platform, while Bezos himself has spoken optimistically about Trump\u2019s potential anti-regulatory agenda in a new term.",
      "Jeff Hauser, founder of the progressive Revolving Door Project, said the lesson tech executives learned from their counterpart Musk this election cycle was \u201cthat there is no greater form of political influence than owning an attention-controlling platform.\u201d",
      "\u201cMusk\u2019s 250-plus-million-dollar expenditure in the election maybe mattered on the margins, but his manipulation of the Twitter algorithm has probably permanently changed American politics in just a couple of years,\u201d Hauser said. \u201cAnd I think that Mark Zuckerberg and others recognize that they have a similar capacity.\u201d",
      "Hauser said he believes what the tech leaders want, more than anything directly relevant to their social media platforms, is favorable artificial intelligence policies.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re gambling on the possibility that this is an economic and economy-defining moment for AI, and they know that the executive branch has a huge role to play in that,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking from the Oval Office hours after his inauguration, Trump said the tech leaders would not be getting anything in exchange for their support.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going to get anything from me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t need money, but I do want the nation to do well, and they\u2019re smart people, and they create a lot of jobs.\u201d",
      "But in the days that followed, Trump has seemingly allowed Musk \u2014 who donated more than a quarter of a billion dollars to support his campaign \u2014 to have free rein over implementing rapid change at federal agencies. Tech leaders also cheered an executive order aimed at loosening policies \u201cthat act as barriers to American AI innovation.\u201d Trump also reversed his earlier position on TikTok \u201cbecause I got to use it\u201d and found it beneficial to his electoral win, he told reporters.",
      "\u201cAnd remember, TikTok is largely about kids, young kids,\u201d Trump said when he was asked about the national security concerns lawmakers in both parties have about its Chinese parent company. \u201cIf China is going to get information about young kids out of it, to be honest, I think we have bigger problems than that.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Still, a Republican lobbyist said the idea that Trump was \u201cceding power to the richest people in the world\u201d was misplaced.",
      "This person added that what Trump gets is what he and conservatives have fought for years for: looser policies around content moderation. Republicans have long argued those policies amounted to censorship on various platforms. Now, their messaging will proliferate the platforms in an uninhibited manner. For Democrats who have warned of the threat of disinformation for years, it is a near-total defeat.",
      "The lobbyist gave real weight to content policy changes at X, formerly Twitter, under Musk for helping Trump win last fall. Now, others will take a page from Musk\u2019s playbook, this person said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s mutually beneficial,\u201d the lobbyist said. \u201cThey obviously make s---loads of money, and Trump won an election because [the internet] got opened up, and he\u2019d like for our party to continue to get coverage that I think he thinks is less biased.\u201d",
      "With Trump back in power and the tech executives appearing to be willing to play ball, conservatives who have long sought to shift tech policy to the right or advance their causes now hope the climate is ripe for progress. Last week, a coalition of conservative intellectuals published an agenda it believes should guide the right on tech policy moving forward, combining interests of both social conservatives and the tech right.",
      "The agenda, titled \u201cA Future for the Family: A New Technology Agenda for the Right,\u201d said a \u201cnew era of technological change ... threatens to supplant the human person and make the family functionally and biologically unnecessary.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut this anti-human outcome is not inevitable,\u201d the authors continued. \u201cConservatives must welcome dynamic innovation, but they should oppose the deployment of technologies that undermine human goods. We must enact policies that elevate the family to a primary constituency of technological advancement. Our aim should be a newly re-functionalized household for the 21st Century.\u201d",
      "Brad Littlejohn, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank, was a co-author of the platform. He said he does have some concern that the budding relationship between Trump and the tech executives could lead to those companies\u2019 securing \u201ca regulatory regime that is very friendly to their attempt to prop up this attention economy.\u201d",
      "But Littlejohn said he sees \u201ca tremendous opening right now\u201d to advance a conservative tech agenda because of how the conversation has shifted on many issues, from allowing kids to have phones in school to social media addiction.",
      "\u201cUp until the last year or two, there\u2019s been a sort of tone of resignation\u201d around many tech issues, Littlejohn said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, this is happening, but what\u2019re you going to do about it? We\u2019re powerless to resist.\u2019 And then all of a sudden, people are like, \u2018Oh, wait, we\u2019re not.\u2019\u201d",
      "Though there have already been some notable shifts and moves, a senior Republican Senate aide reported not having noticed too much change on the major social media platforms.",
      "\u201cFrom the attention economy standpoint, things don\u2019t feel\u201d different, this person said. \u201cX is what it is. ... I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going down on Facebook. My Instagram is still pretty neutral.\u201d",
      "One of the biggest things Trump is getting from the executives, this person said, is not directly obvious on their platforms: \u201clegitimacy\u201d and an acknowledgment that \u201cthis guy runs the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn 2016 they all were reflexively anti-Trump,\u201d the aide said, \u201cbecause they thought that was the best way to achieve their goals. Now they\u2019re just going full 180, but [they have] the same goals.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Attorneys for the Justice Department have agreed to temporarily restrict staffers associated with Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing information in the Treasury Department\u2019s payment system.",
      "The agreement comes after a group of union members and retirees sued the Treasury Department alleging that providing DOGE access to the federal government\u2019s massive payment and collections system \u2014 and the personal data housed in it \u2014 violated federal privacy laws.",
      "The Trump administration filed a motion Wednesday night seeking to enter a proposed order that detailed the agreed-upon terms.",
      "\"The Defendants will not provide access to any payment record or payment system of records maintained by or within the Bureau of the Fiscal Service,\" the proposed order says.",
      "The order would allow exceptions for two special government employees at the Treasury \u2014 Tom Krause and Marko Elez \u2014 saying they are permitted access \"as needed\" to perform their duties, \"provided that such access to payment records will be 'read only.'\"",
      "The restricted access would remain in effect pending a subsequent hearing on the lawsuit. The judge still needs to sign off on the proposed order.",
      "The White House and the groups that filed the lawsuit did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The suit contends newly minted Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent should not have given DOGE access to the secure system. Bessent \"decided behind closed doors to allow\u00a0individuals not involved in the processing of the government\u2019s financial transactions to root around in the Bureau\u2019s records. Giving access to those records is unlawful,\" their filing said.",
      "\"And the longer that the private information of Plaintiffs\u2019 members remains accessible to unauthorized third parties, the greater the irreparable injury is. After all, as long as the sensitive data of Plaintiffs\u2019 members remains accessible to Mr. Musk and other members of DOGE, the more opportunity there is for that data to be disclosed to still more unauthorized third parties, either accidentally or deliberately,\" they added.",
      "The lawsuit sought a temporary restraining order barring Treasury from \"disclosing information about individuals\" to DOGE and directing the agency \"to retrieve and safeguard any such information that has already been obtained by DOGE or individuals associated with it.\"",
      "At a hearing Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, a Justice Department lawyer denied that Treasury was sharing Americans' personal information.",
      "\u201cThe allegation that that information is being shared with third parties outside of Treasury is incorrect,\u201d attorney Bradley Humphreys said.\u00a0He said that two DOGE appointees classified as special government employees, the same status held by Musk, have been granted access to the systems but that there is no plan for those two employees or any other DOGE employee working at the Treasury Department to share the information with Musk or anyone outside of Treasury.",
      "DOGE's actions under Musk \u2014 a tech billionaire and key ally of President Donald Trump \u2014 have prompted fierce criticism from Democrats, who have painted Musk as an unelected bureaucrat who is amassing outsized power and reshaping the federal government without the necessary checks and balances.",
      "\"Let\u2019s not mince words here: An unelected, unaccountable billionaire with expansive conflicts of interest, deep ties to China and an indiscreet ax to grind against perceived enemies is hijacking our nation\u2019s most sensitive financial data system and its checkbook,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a floor speech Wednesday.",
      "Musk, who spearheads DOGE, has defended it as \"something that is sorely needed,\" framing his efforts as cutting down on wasteful spending.",
      "\"DOGE is the wood chipper for bureaucracy,\" he said Monday on X.",
      "Musk is working in the Trump administration as a \"special government employee,\" according to a White House official, meaning he is not a full-time federal worker. That categorization also suggests Musk's employment period in the White House is limited to about a third of a year.",
      "On the first day of his second term, Trump renamed the U.S. Digital Service as the Department of Government Efficiency. He had previously announced that Musk would help lead the advisory group.",
      "Musk has targeted the U.S. Agency for International Development for elimination, prompting the administration to grind humanitarian assistance to a near halt. He has also turned his attention toward the other wings of the federal government, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that DOGE would have a role in his department, as well, saying on X that the entity is \"going to plug in to help upgrade our aviation system.\""

    "story": [
      "Top officials at the Education Department told staff members Wednesday that if they accept the Trump administration\u2019s deferred resignation package, the education secretary may later cancel it and employees would not have any recourse, potentially leaving them without promised pay.",
      "The Office of Personnel Management sent notices last week to federal employees that if they resign by Thursday, they could continue receiving pay and benefits until the end of September. The Trump administration hopes to get as much as 10% of the workforce to quit as part of a plan to shrink the federal bureaucracy.",
      "But three Education Department officials told NBC News that Rachel Oglesby, the department\u2019s new chief of staff, and Jacqueline Clay, its chief human capital officer, described significant caveats to the so-called Fork in the Road offer in an all-staff meeting held over Zoom on Wednesday. The officials did not want to be named for fear of retaliation.",
      "The education secretary would be allowed to rescind the agreement, or the government could stop paying, and employees who took the deferred resignation package would waive all legal claims, the three officials said they were told in the meeting. The three employees say they have seen only sample resignation agreements so far and would need to agree to resign by Thursday evening before they could see the actual terms of their separations.",
      "\u201cIt sounded like a commercial for a used car dealership, like, \u2018Act now, one day only,\u2019\u201d said a department official who attended the meeting.",
      "Spokespersons for the Education Department and the OPM said that was false, pointing to a memo that says the resignation offer\u2019s \u201cassurances are binding on the government. Were the government to backtrack on its commitments, an employee would be entitled to request a rescission of his or her resignation.\u201d",
      "However, the memo includes a sample agreement that includes a clause that agency heads retain the sole discretion to rescind the deals and that employees waive the right to challenge them before the Merit Systems Protection Board\u00a0\"or any other forum.\u201d",
      "A sample deferred resignation agreement specific for Education Department employees includes similar language, according to a copy obtained by NBC News.",
      "Across the federal government, pressure from the Trump administration to take the buyout offer has been mounting. In an email to federal employees Tuesday following up on the original buyout proposal, the OPM wrote: \u201cPlease note the Deferred Resignation program (\u2018Fork in the Road\u2019) expires at 11:59 p.m. ET on Thursday February 6th. There will not be an extension of this program.\u201d",
      "More than 40,000 people have taken the buyout offer so far, according to a White House official, out of a federal workforce of over 2 million people.",
      "There is deep concern among federal workers that the Trump administration\u2019s buyout offer could turn out to be a bait-and-switch, with the government potentially failing to hold up its end of the bargain. Education Department managers\u2019 comments only worsened those concerns, the three employees said.",
      "\u201cThe morale is pretty bad,\u201d a second official said. \u201cOne of the managers I work with just said he hasn\u2019t seen any emails in the last four hours since the meeting ended, because everybody just kind of had the life sucked out of them.\u201d",
      "A third employee described the tone of the call as angry, as workers put questions in Zoom\u2019s chat box but then did not get responses.",
      "The unusual buyout offer has upended Washington amid a flurry of executive orders and maneuvers by Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who is head of Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, an office within the White House. In just two weeks, Trump and Musk have launched a sweeping effort to remake the federal government, slash spending and even eliminate some agencies.",
      "Many Democrats and some Republicans say Trump and Musk are violating constitutional limits on the presidency in ways that are unlawful and that are precipitating a constitutional crisis.",
      "Some labor unions for federal workers have sued to stop the deferred resignation program, arguing that the Trump administration does not have legal authority to offer such buyouts. Federal government labor unions and Democratic state attorneys general have warned federal workers that they may never receive the promised resignation benefits and characterized the offers as an attempt to intimidate them into quitting.",
      "Trump has nominated Linda McMahon, the former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO and head of the Small Business Administration in his first administration, to be education secretary. No confirmation hearing is scheduled yet.",
      "Other staffing changes coming to the Education Department may arrive before McMahon does. The department expects to conduct layoffs, known as Reductions in Force, the three department officials said they were told during Wednesday\u2019s meeting. Oglesby, the chief of staff, and Clay, the human capital officer, did not say when those will take place or which offices will be hit hardest during the meeting.",
      "Education Department staff members will also need to go into the office daily by Feb. 24. Clay told staff members that department leaders are working to find another federal building for remote employees to work from within 50 miles of their homes.",
      "Trump has said he wants to eliminate the Education Department, which would fulfill a longtime dream of the Republican base but is supposed to take an act of Congress to achieve. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the White House is weighing executive action that could dismantle the department in a piecemeal fashion, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter."

    "title": "Agents say mass firings could dangerously weaken FBI in three ways",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 03:05:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Abject fear among agents that they could lose their jobs has distracted and destabilized the FBI workforce, current and former federal law enforcement officials say.",
    "story": [
      "First-of-their-kind lawsuits, near-daily staff memos from the little-known acting FBI director and abject fear among agents that they could lose their jobs have distracted and destabilized the FBI workforce, a half-dozen current and former federal law enforcement officials with experience in the bureau told NBC News.",
      "The tensions at the country's most powerful federal law enforcement agency follow a Trump administration request for the names of thousands of agents assigned to work on Capitol riot-related investigations. Assurances from the administration that it will review agents\u2019 conduct and not necessarily fire them have not quelled fears of mass firings.",
      "If the new administration fires or punishes agents involved in the Jan. 6 investigations \u2014 referred to within the bureau as simply \u201c1-6\" \u2014 it could affect the FBI in three dangerous ways, the current and former law enforcement officials said.",
      "National security risk",
      "Many of the agents involved in the investigations of the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, work in the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism Division, which operates Joint Terrorism Task Forces in cities across the country with federal and local law enforcement agencies. Those agents investigate terrorism threats both from inside the United States and from overseas groups, such as ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hamas and Hezbollah.",
      "Most of the Joint Terrorism Task Forces in the United States are primarily made up of FBI agents, say the officials, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss dynamics in the bureau. And most of the terrorism cases are brought by the FBI, according to court documents and public filings.",
      "So the potential removal of thousands of those agents \u2014 some estimate the number of counterterrorism agents could be over 4,000 \u2014 poses a major threat to the FBI\u2019s ability to combat terrorist threats, the current and former officials say.",
      "The agents who worked on Jan. 6 cases were assigned to do so by superiors or by court orders in many instances, the officials noted. Agents and other FBI staff members do not pick their assignments.",
      "Punishing thousands of Jan. 6 case agents could also damage FBI operations not related to terrorism, the current and former officials say. Agents from smaller FBI field offices, for example, were also brought in to work on Jan. 6 cases. Dismissing those agents could affect smaller FBI field offices that investigate misconduct by local law enforcement agencies, corporations and public officials.",
      "Public corruption risk",
      "Retaliation against agents who worked on Jan. 6 investigations could also have a chilling effect on FBI agents' desire to investigate future cases involving the second Trump administration.",
      "The current and former officials say they wonder whether FBI officials would be willing to investigate, for example, a person in Trump\u2019s personal orbit. A past example would Paul Manafort, Trump's 2016 campaign manager, who was investigated by FBI agents and convicted of tax and bank fraud.",
      "An investigation into a Manafort-like figure would dismay agents and potentially prompt some to refuse to investigate him, citing fear of reprisal, current and former officials say. Agents might also wonder about the consequences of investigating prominent Democratic figures, should they retake the White House.",
      "Democratic leaders have not called for the firing of FBI agents involved in the investigations of former Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., or Hunter Biden, for example. But FBI personnel are concerned that the payback pendulum could swing both ways, the officials say.",
      "A former FBI official who asked not to be named, citing fears of retaliation, predicted that the current probe of Jan. 6 agents will have a lasting impact. \u201cThe chilling effect \u2014 it has a long tail,\u201d the former official said. \u201cYou\u2019re putting everyone on notice. They\u2019re saying, \u2018We\u2019re watching you.\u2019\u201d",
      "Retention and recruitment risks",
      "Firing agents would also be likely to damage efforts to retain veteran agents and recruit new ones, the current and former officials say.",
      "Agents fired for their work on Jan. 6 cases would be unable to get hired by other federal law enforcement agencies, the officials say. If they managed to get hired by local police departments, it would most likely be for less pay and lower retirement benefits.",
      "The economic impact on agents\u2019 families would be immediate, the officials say. Since agents frequently work long hours and spend extensive time away from home, they are often their families\u2019 sole breadwinners.",
      "What surprises agents is that many genuinely believed that a new administration would bring positive change, the current and former officials say. Many agents hoped a new FBI director would bring much-needed changes to the structure and management of the FBI.",
      "They hoped more agents would be sent into the field from headquarters in Washington, the officials say. And they hoped that new technology would be adopted, which many officials told NBC News is sorely needed.",
      "An unlikely leader",
      "As rumors of mass layoffs have shaken the workforce in ways not seen in decades, an unexpected leader has emerged. Staffers have lauded acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll Jr., a career agent and the head of the FBI\u2019s field office in Newark, New Jersey, for standing up to Trump appointees and pushing back against orders for agents to be fired.\u00a0Current and former agents said Driscoll resisted the efforts so forcefully at times that they feared he might be forced out himself.",
      "On Tuesday, Driscoll released a video touting the FBI's recent accomplishments, including recent arrests of two people on the FBI\u2019s Most Wanted Fugitives list and agents' roles in investigating the plane crashes over Washington, D.C., and in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cWe will never take our eyes off of our mission, protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution,\u201d Driscoll said. \u201cBecause at the bureau we\u2019re focused on the work, the people we do the work with, our partners and the people we do the work for, the American people.\u201d",
      "Agents credit Driscoll with stopping mass firings, for now, current and former officials say. They also know that the Trump administration could remove him at any time."

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 12:49:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Researchers Australia said that they have for the first time successfully produced the first kangaroo embryos through IVF. It may help save endangered species.",
    "story": [
      "It's a major scientific leap \u2014 or at least a hop.",
      "Researchers in Australia said Thursday that they have for the first time successfully produced the first kangaroo embryos through in-vitro fertilization, in a breakthrough that may help save endangered species from extinction.",
      "Australia is not short of kangaroos \u2014 the bouncing creatures are commonly eaten there \u2014 but they are from the marsupial group of mammals that is mostly found in the country and has lost many species to extinction.",
      "The researchers' use of IVF on kangaroo eggs and sperm may help support the conservation of those marsupials, said Andres Gambini,  lead researcher and University of Queensland lecturer.",
      "\u201cOur team built on years of experience working with reproductive technologies in domestic animals like livestock and horses,\u201d Gambini told NBC News via email. \u201cBy adapting these techniques to the unique biology of kangaroos, we were able to create an embryo in the lab for the first time.\u201d",
      "The research will help scientists learn more about how marsupial embryos grow because the class reproduces differently compared to other mammals.",
      "\u201cKangaroos have a very short pregnancy, and the embryo can go into suspended animation for several months,\u201d Gambini said. \u201cOur success with IVF helps us better understand these early stages of development.\u201d",
      "Australia is one of the world's most biodiverse countries but also has the highest rate of mammal extinction. Australia\u2019s invasive species council says that since the European settlement, at least 33 mammal species have become extinct, with many of those marsupials.",
      "A historically high rate of extinction led the Australian government in 2022 to announce a 10-year\u00a0\u201czero extinctions\u201d plan to protect those under threat, reserving at least 30% of the country\u2019s land mass for conservation.",
      "\u201cIf we keep doing what we\u2019re doing, more plants and animals will become extinct,\u201d Australian Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said in the report. \u201cEven koalas are now endangered on the east coast of Australia.\u201d",
      "Now, more than 2,200 species in the country are classified as threatened with extinction, according to a 2023\u00a0report\u00a0by the nonprofit Australian Conservation Foundation.",
      "\u201cThe laws that are meant to be protecting Australia\u2019s nature are failing,\u201d the report said, adding that the country\u2019s major conservation policy as it existed then was \u201cbarely monitored, rarely enforced and full of loopholes that allow businesses to destroy nature.\u201d",
      "While kangaroos are not endangered, the University of Queensland researchers hope the latest breakthrough can help to preserve other endangered marsupial species native to the continent, including koalas, Tasmanian devils and northern hairy-nosed wombats.",
      "\u201cThis work gives us a new tool to help preserve genetic material in endangered species,\u201d Gambini said. \u201cBy creating and freezing embryos, we can safeguard the unique genetic of these animals.\u201d",
      "It's not the first time IVF has been used as a tool to preserve endangered species.",
      "Last year, scientists in Italy achieved the world\u2019s first IVF rhino pregnancy, offering hope for saving Kenya's northern white rhino \u2014 of which there are only two animals left on the planet \u2014 from extinction. They did so by transferring a lab-created rhino embryo into a surrogate mother.",
      "Still, the latest IVF breakthrough is just one step on a long road to a more comprehensive solution, Gambini said.",
      "\u201cThere are many unknowns, as we are just on the beginning and there is lot to discover yet,\u201d he said, adding that when combined with other strategies, \u201cit can make a real difference for species at risk.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "A test designed to identify biomarkers associated with autism just became available in most states.The test is meant to help physicians rule out autism in children who have higher likelihoods of it.The results are based on a metabolic analysis that requires just a strand of hair, but experts say more research is needed.",
      "A test designed to identify biomarkers associated with autism just became available in most states.",
      "The test is meant to help physicians rule out autism in children who have higher likelihoods of it.",
      "The results are based on a metabolic analysis that requires just a strand of hair, but experts say more research is needed.",
      "A test designed to identify biomarkers associated with autism in infants and young children is now available to the public in most states.",
      "LinusBio, a New Jersey-based startup, on Thursday launched the test, called Clearstrand-ASD, which it says can help physicians rule out autism in children 1 to 36 months old. The test requires just a single strand of hair.",
      "The test cannot diagnose autism spectrum disorder, nor is it designed to be used on its own. Instead, it is meant to help physicians rule out autism in children who have higher likelihoods of it. That could be because a kid has a sibling with autism or has demonstrated behaviors associated with the disorder.",
      "Manish Arora, a co-founder of LinusBio and its CEO, said Clearstrand-ASD is the only biochemical test available to detect autism spectrum disorder in children younger than 18 months. He hopes it will make the process of ruling out autism more efficient and reduce the wait for those in most need of intervention or treatment.",
      "\u201cThe focus is really on early intervention,\u201d Arora said. \u201cThe earlier you intervene, the better off children are.\u201d",
      "The test uses children\u2019s hair strands to analyze their metabolic histories, which tell the story of the substances or toxins they have been exposed to or have processed over time, Arora previously told NBC News. His research has identified patterns of dysregulation in exposure to or metabolism of metals that some evidence suggests could be associated with autism. Hair can offer a kind of timeline of what was going on in a child\u2019s body, including patterns of metal exposure, during specific developmental stages.",
      "\u201cWe can detect the clear rhythm of autism with just about 1 centimeter of hair,\u201d Arora previously told NBC News, comparing the dynamic to the way a tree\u2019s rings can tell the story of what the environment was like at a particular time in its growth.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration has not approved the Clearstrand-ASD test. But as of Thursday, it is available to consumers in 44 states \u2014 if they are able to pay the $2,750 cost. (It is not yet eligible for insurance coverage.) The test can be ordered by a primary care provider or directly through LinusBio, which sets up a telehealth appointment with an independent physician it provides, Arora said.",
      "\u201cYou come to us, you get a prescription from an independent clinician. We send out the kit to you. You get the result all within about three weeks,\u201d he said.",
      "The diagnostic aid is still early in its development, and data supporting its effectiveness is limited. At the Metabolomics and Human Health Conference in Ventura, California, on Thursday, LinusBio shared some new, initial findings. In a group of 490 children in California with elevated risk of autism spectrum disorder, the test was able to rule it out with about 92.5% accuracy, the company said. However, the results have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.",
      "A 2022 study of the company\u2019s methodology, published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine, analyzed a different LinusBio test that is still in development and found that the methodology accurately predicted autism diagnoses \u2014 positives and negatives \u2014 about 81% of the time.",
      "The test is one of several promising ideas that researchers are pursuing as ways to identify or rule out autism early in a child\u2019s life. Other scientists are looking into eye-tracking, blood testing and audio analysis as possible methods.",
      "Clearstrand-ASD works by running a laser over the length of hair being tested, which turns the hair into a plasma that can be processed by machine-learning algorithms. Results from the full analysis are expected within three weeks, after which a child\u2019s parents join a follow-up telehealth appointment.",
      "Outside experts said LinusBio\u2019s hair strand test has shown promise but needs more research.",
      "\u201cTo me this feels like it\u2019s on the earlier side of things, not the earliest. They have some compelling results,\u201d said Stephen Sheinkopf, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Missouri School of Medicine and the Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment. \u201cThis seems like an approach that has the potential to be part of a suite of ways we can screen children for concerns, but it\u2019s, to me, at the stage of needing more evidence.\u201d",
      "Sheinkopf suggested that families with young children who are worried about the possibility of autism work closely with pediatricians or primary care physicians who carefully monitor the children\u2019s development and screen them for autism.",
      "\u201cSometimes we see the shiny new tool \u2014 we want to skip over the things that are already available,\u201d he said.",
      "Sheinkopf also noted that parents who have evidence of differences in their child\u2019s development can seek federally mandated services without a formal diagnosis.",
      "Seeking an autism diagnosis for a child can take a long time. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends autism screenings at 18 months and 24 months. Neurological examinations, language assessments, behavior observations and other methods are ultimately used to diagnose a child.",
      "Arora said he hopes that by helping rule out autism for some children, his company\u2019s test could prioritize attention for those most in need and reduce the wait times for families seeking care or treatment.",
      "Rebecca Landa, executive director of the Center for Autism Services, Science and Innovation at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, a pediatric care center in Baltimore focused on developmental disabilities, said there is a shortage of specialists to diagnose and help treat autism. So she hopes the test could make the flow of children to specialists more efficient.",
      "\u201cThat could accelerate the rate at which children get seen. And so that way, the children who are very low likelihood for autism are not sitting in the pipeline waiting to see a certain kind of specialist,\u201d she said."

      "Three men who are alleged to be part of a theft group from South America were indicted Wednesday in the break-in at Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow\u2019s home, prosecutors in Ohio said.",
      "The three men, all from Chile, were arrested on state charges in Ohio late last month in connection with the break-in, which was discovered at the home in Hamilton County on Dec. 9.",
      "Burrow was in Texas at the time, leading the Bengals to a 27-20 win over the Dallas Cowboys.",
      "Jordan Francisco Quiroga Sanchez, 22; Bastian Alejandro Orellana Morales, 23; and Sergio Andres Ortega Cabello, 38; were indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury. They are charged federally with transporting stolen goods interstate and falsifying records in a federal investigation.",
      "\u201cOur investigation remains ongoing as these individuals seem to be the alleged tip of the iceberg of South American Theft Groups committing crimes throughout our district and elsewhere,\u201d Kenneth L. Parker, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, said in a statement.",
      "An FBI affidavit filed with a criminal complaint Monday says investigators found photos in Cabello's phone showing items stolen in the burglary and of the three men posing together with another man.",
      "Burrow\u2019s name is not spelled out in court documents, but the victim is referred to as \"J.B., an NFL player for the Cincinnati Bengals.\" Using initials in a criminal complaint is not unusual.",
      "The date and time the break-in was discovered as laid out in the indictment matches a Hamilton County Sheriff\u2019s Office incident report that does name Burrow \u2014 and Burrow himself acknowledged that his home was broken into and said he felt violated, including by the information that was out in the public.",
      "\"So, obviously everybody has heard what has happened. I feel like my privacy has been violated in more ways than one,\" Burrow said Dec. 11, two days after the break-in. \"And way more is out than I would want out there and that I care to share.\"",
      "The burglary was reported at around 8:14 p.m. on Dec. 9, by an associate of the homeowner who saw disarray and a broken window, the federal prosecutor's office said.",
      "More than $300,000 in luggage, glasses, wristwatches and jewelry was stolen, an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit as part of a criminal complaint against the three men filed Monday.",
      "A trail camera caught a single person carrying luggage near the home, and nearby license plate readers led to the identification of a suspicious vehicle, a 2024 Volkswagen Atlas SUV, which was later found abandoned in Florida, the FBI agent wrote.",
      "The person who leased that SUV led the FBI to the eventual discovery that Cabello leased it using a fake ID, and then investigators identified Morales from a photo of the pair in the vehicle, the affidavit says.",
      "Cellphone data led to a motel in Fairborn, Ohio, on Jan. 10, and all three men now federally charged were pulled over by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, according to the FBI affidavit.",
      "A fourth man was also arrested and faces state charges. All of them were in the country without authorization, having either entered the county illegally or overstayed their visas, the FBI agent wrote.",
      "Federal online court records did not show attorneys for any of the three men federally charged Wednesday evening.",
      "Two men alleged to be linked to the burglary crew accused in the break-in of Burrow's home were charged this week in New York with acting as \"fences.\" A \u201cfencing\u201d operation involves the buying and selling of stolen goods.",
      "The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn charged Dimitriy Nezhinskiy and Juan Villar with conspiracy to receive stolen property.",
      "Nezhinskiy is alleged to have had contact with at least two members of the group that broke into the home in Ohio on Dec. 9, the U.S. attorney's office said.",
      "Nezhinskiy and Villar pleaded not guilty in federal court in Brooklyn on Wednesday.",

      "Nezhinskiy's attorney, Todd Greenberg, told reporters outside court that he was happy that the judge set bond, although they still have to secure liens and Nezhinskiy was not expected to be released Wednesday.",
      "\"It\u2019s just the beginning of the case, as you know,\" Greenberg said. \"We\u2019re looking forward to seeing the evidence, and we\u2019re going to take it from there and look forward to fighting the case.\""

      "President Donald Trump is ready to take his fight against transgender athletes to the International Olympic Committee.",
      "Trump said Wednesday during a signing ceremony for an executive order aimed at banning transgender athletes from women\u2019s sports that his administration wants the IOC to \u201cchange everything having to do with the Olympics and having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject\u201d ahead of the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.",
      "The order empowers the Secretary of State\u2019s office to pressure the IOC to amend standards governing Olympic sporting events \u201cto promote fairness, safety and the best interests of female athletes by ensuring that eligibility for participation in women\u2019s sporting events is determined according to sex and not gender identity or testosterone reduction.\u201d",
      "The order also calls for the Secretary of State and the Department of Homeland Security to \u201creview and adjust, as needed, policies permitting admission to the United States of males seeking to participate in women\u2019s sports.\u201d There is no evidence that male athletes have competed in women\u2019s Olympics events.",
      "Outgoing IOC President Thomas Bach said in December that Olympic organizers were \u201cvery confident\u201d they could work with the Trump administration. The president initially backed Los Angeles during his first administration when the city bid for the 2024 Games that were awarded to Paris.",
      "Officials with the LA28 organizing committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "LA28 organizing committee chairman Casey Wasserman reportedly met with Trump in Florida last month before Trump\u2019s second term began, with Wasserman saying afterward both were looking forward to delivering a successful Games.",
      "The IOC has largely stayed out of the discussion around transgender athletes, letting the international governing bodies for each sport set the parameters for gender participation.",
      "The rules can run the gamut. Entities like World Aquatics have very strict guidelines, while World Triathlon rules are more liberal.",
      "The IOC\u2019s stance could change considerably in the near future following Bach\u2019s retirement. Among the candidates to replace Bach is former track star Sebastian Coe, now the leader of World Athletics. Coe has been a strong proponent of limiting participation in female sports to cisgender women.",
      "Two years ago, track and field under Coe banned transgender athletes from international competition \u2014 adopting the same rules as swimming \u2014 and adopted new regulations requiring some athletes to undergo hormone-suppressing treatment for six months before competing to be eligible.",
      "The rhetoric around transgender athletes heated up at the Paris Olympics last summer, with Trump eagerly entering the fray.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump frequently misgendered two Olympic female boxers as men and said their ability to participate in the Paris Games was \u201cdemeaning to women\u201d even though both Imane Khelif of Algeria and Li Yu-ting of Taiwan were assigned female at birth and identify as women.",
      "Trump referenced both athletes again on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThey had two women or two people that transitioned and both of them won gold medals and they won them very convincingly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut all of that ends today because with this executive order, the war on women\u2019s sports is over.\u201d",
      "The question going forward is what kind of leverage the United States can use to influence the IOC. Given the volatile nature of the issue, Trump\u2019s order could begin a groundswell among international federations for the IOC to come up with a uniform standard."

The team suspended him the next day and announced in a statement it would listen to trade offers for Butler.",
      "After returning for three games in mid-January from his initial seven-game suspension, Butler was suspended a second time for missing a team flight, and then a third time for leaving practice early. He has not appeared in a game since Jan. 21.",

      "Golden State, with an aging superstar in Stephen Curry, are in 10th place in the Western Conference.",
      "In Butler, the Warriors are acquiring a player who twice led Miami to the NBA finals, once in 2020 and again in 2023. Last May, after the Heat were eliminated from the playoffs, team president Pat Riley balked at signing Butler to a similar extension, saying the team had a year to decide on the contract. Riley\u2019s comments reportedly struck a nerve with Butler, who grew discontent with only a player option for next season remaining on his deal."

      "China has blacklisted the owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, which could force the company to shut down stores and manufacturing in an early repercussion of\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war.",
      "China added\u00a0PVH Corp.\u00a0to its \u201cunreliable entities\u201d list on Tuesday, which allows the Chinese government to fine the retailer, prohibit import and export activities, revoke work permits, and deny employees the ability to enter the country, among other deliberately vague powers.",
      "While China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce\u00a0began investigating\u00a0PVH in September for allegedly refusing to source cotton from the Xinjiang region, which has become notorious for its Uyghur detention camps, Beijing officially placed the company on its blacklist on Tuesday. The announcement came just days after Trump slapped a 10% tariff on imports from China, and came along with a slew of\u00a0other retaliatory measures\u00a0against the U.S., including new duties on energy imports and farm gear.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this tit-for-tat trade war going on, and [China] wants to show the United States that it\u2019s going to take action to hurt either big U.S. companies or companies with significant interests in the U.S.,\u201d said Michael Kaye, a partner at Squire Patton Boggs, who has been practicing international trade law for more than 30 years. \u201cThey\u2019re being made an example. ... My guess is, [China] wanted to pick somebody and they wanted it to be somebody that was high visibility.\u201d",
      "Now that PVH is on the unreliable entities list, China could force the company to shut down the dozens of stores that it operates in the region and forbid it from selling its wares to Chinese consumers online, said Kaye. Its staff \u2014 including those who\u2019ve built lives in China \u2014 could be effectively deported and sent home, Kaye added.",
      "It is unclear if China would try to enforce actions against PVH in the autonomous region of Hong Kong, where the company\u2019s Asia-Pacific headquarters are.\u00a0In 2020, China passed a law that gave it more power to enforce national laws\u00a0in Hong Kong, and that is \u201cparticularly the case with laws applicable to national security,\u201d\u00a0which could include the unreliable entities list,\u00a0said Kaye.",
      "As of Thursday morning Eastern time, the company appeared to be operating its business as usual in China.",
      "China could even prohibit PVH from manufacturing in the region altogether, which could force it to move production to other countries and struggle to meet customer orders.",
      "It\u2019s unclear which steps exactly China will take, or if the Trump administration will try to convince China not to punish the company.",
      "In a statement, PVH said that it was \u201csurprised and deeply disappointed to learn of the decision from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn our 20 years of operating in China and proudly serving our consumers, as a matter of policy, PVH maintains strict compliance with all relevant laws and regulations and operates in line with established industry standards and practices.\u00a0We will continue our engagement with relevant authorities and look forward to a positive resolution,\u201d the company said.",
      "China represented 6% of PVH\u2019s sales and 16% of its earnings before interest and taxes in 2023, but it relies more heavily on the country for manufacturing, which is the bigger risk to its business. PVH has more factories and suppliers in China than in any other region, representing about 18% of production, according to a disclosure it issued in December.",
      "\u201cThis has the potential to be very, very disruptive for PVH,\u201d said GlobalData managing director and retail analyst Neil Saunders. \u201cThey would certainly have to scramble to find new capacity. They\u2019d be able to do that in time, of course, but the two things that are at issue are that, because a lot of supply chains are just in time, they would probably find that they did get short on inventory whilst they made the transition. The other issue, of course, is quality.\u201d",
      "PVH has operated in China for more than 20 years, and while it works with suppliers and factories in more than 30 other countries, the higher-end goods that it makes can be difficult to manufacture elsewhere because of the skill level needed, said Saunders.",
      "\u201cWhile you can shift manufacturing capacity reasonably easily, it\u2019s not so easy to guarantee the quality, guarantee the production processes. Those things take time to upskill,\u201d said Saunders. \u201cChina has that capacity and has those skills, because PVH has been operating there for ages. Another country, another manufacturing facility, may not have those skills immediately.\u201d",
      "Plus, PVH has viewed China as a growth market and it will now have to look for new strategies to increase sales and profitability as demand falls for its high-end dresses, intimate apparel and sweaters.",
      "China\u2019s unreliable entities list is a relatively new law in the country, and experts say it\u2019s deliberately opaque. The government has wide latitude to take action against PVH, but it remains unclear what exactly it will do. Typically, guidance comes within a few days of a company\u2019s placement on the blacklist, said Kaye.",
      "China could add PVH to the list and do nothing to the company, but Kaye said the chances of that are \u201cvery slim\u201d because the government will want to avoid the perception that it\u2019s backing down. China will more likely use PVH as a bargaining chip at the negotiating table with Trump, and use it as an example to show the power it has to inflict pain on\u00a0other U.S. businesses\u00a0with major operations and customer bases in China, such as\u00a0Nike,\u00a0Apple,\u00a0General Motors,\u00a0Starbucks\u00a0and others.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sort of sword of Damocles hanging over [PVH\u2019s] head, and that is exactly what this is, because this isn\u2019t really about PVH at all. This is about PVH being caught in the spat between China and the U.S.,\u201d said Saunders. \u201cChina is using PVH as an example to say, look, if tariffs go ahead, if other restrictions are put in place on China, we can make life difficult for U.S. companies in the country. That\u2019s really what this is about.\u201d",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump is ready to take his fight against transgender athletes to the International Olympic Committee.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is ready to take his fight against transgender athletes to the International Olympic Committee.",
      "Trump said Wednesday during a signing ceremony for an executive order aimed at banning transgender athletes from women\u2019s sports that his administration wants the IOC to \u201cchange everything having to do with the Olympics and having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject\u201d ahead of the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.",
      "The order empowers the Secretary of State\u2019s office to pressure the IOC to amend standards governing Olympic sporting events \u201cto promote fairness, safety and the best interests of female athletes by ensuring that eligibility for participation in women\u2019s sporting events is determined according to sex and not gender identity or testosterone reduction.\u201d",
      "The order also calls for the Secretary of State and the Department of Homeland Security to \u201creview and adjust, as needed, policies permitting admission to the United States of males seeking to participate in women\u2019s sports.\u201d There is no evidence that male athletes have competed in women\u2019s Olympics events.",
      "Outgoing IOC President Thomas Bach said in December that Olympic organizers were \u201cvery confident\u201d they could work with the Trump administration. The president initially backed Los Angeles during his first administration when the city bid for the 2024 Games that were awarded to Paris.",
      "Officials with the LA28 organizing committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "LA28 organizing committee chairman Casey Wasserman reportedly met with Trump in Florida last month before Trump\u2019s second term began, with Wasserman saying afterward both were looking forward to delivering a successful Games.",
      "The IOC has largely stayed out of the discussion around transgender athletes, letting the international governing bodies for each sport set the parameters for gender participation.",
      "The rules can run the gamut. Entities like World Aquatics have very strict guidelines, while World Triathlon rules are more liberal.",
      "The IOC\u2019s stance could change considerably in the near future following Bach\u2019s retirement. Among the candidates to replace Bach is former track star Sebastian Coe, now the leader of World Athletics. Coe has been a strong proponent of limiting participation in female sports to cisgender women.",
      "Two years ago, track and field under Coe banned transgender athletes from international competition \u2014 adopting the same rules as swimming \u2014 and adopted new regulations requiring some athletes to undergo hormone-suppressing treatment for six months before competing to be eligible.",
      "The rhetoric around transgender athletes heated up at the Paris Olympics last summer, with Trump eagerly entering the fray.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump frequently misgendered two Olympic female boxers as men and said their ability to participate in the Paris Games was \u201cdemeaning to women\u201d even though both Imane Khelif of Algeria and Li Yu-ting of Taiwan were assigned female at birth and identify as women.",
      "Trump referenced both athletes again on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThey had two women or two people that transitioned and both of them won gold medals and they won them very convincingly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut all of that ends today because with this executive order, the war on women\u2019s sports is over.\u201d",
      "The question going forward is what kind of leverage the United States can use to influence the IOC. Given the volatile nature of the issue, Trump\u2019s order could begin a groundswell among international federations for the IOC to come up with a uniform standard."

    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "A test designed to identify biomarkers associated with autism just became available in most states.The test is meant to help physicians rule out autism in children who have higher likelihoods of it.The results are based on a metabolic analysis that requires just a strand of hair, but experts say more research is needed.",
      "A test designed to identify biomarkers associated with autism just became available in most states.",
      "The test is meant to help physicians rule out autism in children who have higher likelihoods of it.",
      "The results are based on a metabolic analysis that requires just a strand of hair, but experts say more research is needed.",
      "A test designed to identify biomarkers associated with autism in infants and young children is now available to the public in most states.",
      "LinusBio, a New Jersey-based startup, on Thursday launched the test, called Clearstrand-ASD, which it says can help physicians rule out autism in children 1 to 36 months old. The test requires just a single strand of hair.",
      "The test cannot diagnose autism spectrum disorder, nor is it designed to be used on its own. Instead, it is meant to help physicians rule out autism in children who have higher likelihoods of it. That could be because a kid has a sibling with autism or has demonstrated behaviors associated with the disorder.",
      "Manish Arora, a co-founder of LinusBio and its CEO, said Clearstrand-ASD is the only biochemical test available to detect autism spectrum disorder in children younger than 18 months. He hopes it will make the process of ruling out autism more efficient and reduce the wait for those in most need of intervention or treatment.",
      "\u201cThe focus is really on early intervention,\u201d Arora said. \u201cThe earlier you intervene, the better off children are.\u201d",
      "The test uses children\u2019s hair strands to analyze their metabolic histories, which tell the story of the substances or toxins they have been exposed to or have processed over time, Arora previously told NBC News. His research has identified patterns of dysregulation in exposure to or metabolism of metals that some evidence suggests could be associated with autism. Hair can offer a kind of timeline of what was going on in a child\u2019s body, including patterns of metal exposure, during specific developmental stages.",
      "\u201cWe can detect the clear rhythm of autism with just about 1 centimeter of hair,\u201d Arora previously told NBC News, comparing the dynamic to the way a tree\u2019s rings can tell the story of what the environment was like at a particular time in its growth.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration has not approved the Clearstrand-ASD test. But as of Thursday, it is available to consumers in 44 states \u2014 if they are able to pay the $2,750 cost. (It is not yet eligible for insurance coverage.) The test can be ordered by a primary care provider or directly through LinusBio, which sets up a telehealth appointment with an independent physician it provides, Arora said.",
      "\u201cYou come to us, you get a prescription from an independent clinician. We send out the kit to you. You get the result all within about three weeks,\u201d he said.",
      "The diagnostic aid is still early in its development, and data supporting its effectiveness is limited. At the Metabolomics and Human Health Conference in Ventura, California, on Thursday, LinusBio shared some new, initial findings. In a group of 490 children in California with elevated risk of autism spectrum disorder, the test was able to rule it out with about 92.5% accuracy, the company said. However, the results have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.",
      "A 2022 study of the company\u2019s methodology, published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine, analyzed a different LinusBio test that is still in development and found that the methodology accurately predicted autism diagnoses \u2014 positives and negatives \u2014 about 81% of the time.",
      "The test is one of several promising ideas that researchers are pursuing as ways to identify or rule out autism early in a child\u2019s life. Other scientists are looking into eye-tracking, blood testing and audio analysis as possible methods.",
      "Clearstrand-ASD works by running a laser over the length of hair being tested, which turns the hair into a plasma that can be processed by machine-learning algorithms. Results from the full analysis are expected within three weeks, after which a child\u2019s parents join a follow-up telehealth appointment.",
      "Outside experts said LinusBio\u2019s hair strand test has shown promise but needs more research.",
      "\u201cTo me this feels like it\u2019s on the earlier side of things, not the earliest. They have some compelling results,\u201d said Stephen Sheinkopf, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Missouri School of Medicine and the Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment. \u201cThis seems like an approach that has the potential to be part of a suite of ways we can screen children for concerns, but it\u2019s, to me, at the stage of needing more evidence.\u201d",
      "Sheinkopf suggested that families with young children who are worried about the possibility of autism work closely with pediatricians or primary care physicians who carefully monitor the children\u2019s development and screen them for autism.",
      "\u201cSometimes we see the shiny new tool \u2014 we want to skip over the things that are already available,\u201d he said.",
      "Sheinkopf also noted that parents who have evidence of differences in their child\u2019s development can seek federally mandated services without a formal diagnosis.",
      "Seeking an autism diagnosis for a child can take a long time. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends autism screenings at 18 months and 24 months. Neurological examinations, language assessments, behavior observations and other methods are ultimately used to diagnose a child.",
      "Arora said he hopes that by helping rule out autism for some children, his company\u2019s test could prioritize attention for those most in need and reduce the wait times for families seeking care or treatment.",
      "Rebecca Landa, executive director of the Center for Autism Services, Science and Innovation at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, a pediatric care center in Baltimore focused on developmental disabilities, said there is a shortage of specialists to diagnose and help treat autism. So she hopes the test could make the flow of children to specialists more efficient.",
      "\u201cThat could accelerate the rate at which children get seen. And so that way, the children who are very low likelihood for autism are not sitting in the pipeline waiting to see a certain kind of specialist,\u201d she said."

      "Donna was the first person in her family to graduate from college",
      "While appearing on a parents episode of the Kelce brothers' podcast, \"New Heights,\" Feb. 6 prior to the 2023 Super Bowl, Donna Kelce, n\u00e9e Blalock, said that she grew up in inner city Cleveland in a \"small house\" with her grandparents living upstairs.",
      "After moving to the suburbs in fourth grade, the mom of two said her own mother was \"very ill\" and passed away when she was 12 and her brother was 10. Following her biological mother's death, Donna Kelce said her dad married a \"wonderful human being\" named Mary.",
      "\"(Mary) raised Don and I,\" Donna Kelce said, referring to her brother. \"And, by the grace of God, if we didn't have her, I don't think we would have made it through.\"",
      "Mary motivated Donna Kelce to go to college, despite the reluctance of her father, who wanted her to attend secretarial school. After earning a degree in broadcast communications from Ohio University, Donna Kelce became the first person in her family to graduate from college.",
      "But Donna Kelce chose not to pursue a career in communications. She went back to school for her masters and ended up in banking.",
      "Ed comes from a long line of military veterans",
      "On the same podcast episode with his sons, Ed Kelce said he was the oldest of two children and grew up in the Collinwood neighborhood of Cleveland.",
      "\"Blue collar town, blue collar part of Cleveland, great neighborhood,\" he said on the podcast of his childhood. \"It was a lot of fun.\"",
      "After graduating from high school, Ed Kelce said he initially attended Ohio State University, but went home after about a \"quarter and a half.\" He said he took credits at two other schools and wound up with about a year of collegiate-level education under his belt.",
      "Ed Kelce then went to work in the steel industry, eventually becoming a sales rep who sold products to manufacturers, he explained in a February interview with The Los Angeles Times.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d take them there \u2014 hard hat, safety glasses, boots, the whole nine yards,\u201d he told the publication of bringing his sons to work. \u201cI\u2019d tell them,' You can have a job like your mother\u2019s, or you can have a job like mine.\u2019\u201d",
      "At one point, he attempted to join the Marines to follow in the footsteps of generations of family members who served in the U.S. military. However, the Marines, nor the Army, would accept him due to a knee injury from high school football that still impacted him.",
      "He began training with the Coast Guard, but explained to his sons on the podcast that he had to drop out because his Crohn's disease was \"acting up\" for the first time in his life.",

      "\"He came up to me with the illustrious pickup line, which was, 'Did you say Joe?' And I said, 'No.' And he said, 'Oh I thought you said Joe.' I said, 'Is your name Joe?' And he said, 'No, it's Ed,'\" she recalled, as the three of them laughed.",

      "\u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d is a based-on-a-true-story drama that takes inspiration from the experiences of Belle Gibson, a wellness influencer who lied about a cancer diagnosis.\u00a0But some\u00a0other characters in the Netflix show are also loosely inspired by real people, take Milla Blake for instance.",
      "Milla, played by Alycia Debnam-Carey, is a fellow wellness influencer who has made a career out of sharing her cancer journey through alternative treatments. Unlike Belle, Milla actually has cancer. (The real Belle Gibson admitted\u00a0to lying about having cancer in an interview with Australia\u2019s\u00a0The Weekly\u00a0in 2015.)",
      "In the show, doctors find cancer in Milla\u2019s arm. Rather than follow their recommendations and amputate, the 22-year-old opts for an alternate medical regimen involving juice and coffee enemas. She builds a career on the idea that she healed her cancer holistically. It seems to work for a while, until the cancer comes back. This time, the spread is fatal and Milla dies.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the facts and fiction of Milla.",
      "Who is Milla Blake based on in real life?",
      "\u201cMilla is an amalgamation of wellness influencers at the time,\u201d Debnam-Carey tells\u00a0TODAY.com. \u201cWe created Milla as her own thing. That was what was so great about it \u2026 we could boost her up so that she could be going toe-to-toe with Belle.\u201d",
      "She says the character was inspired in part by\u00a0Jessica Ainscough, the editor of a teen magazine who was diagnosed with epithelioid sarcoma when she was 22, and nicknamed\u00a0herself\u00a0\u201cThe Wellness Warrior.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Ainscough and Milla share similarities. In Ainscough\u2019s now-deleted blog post on her five-year diagnosis anniversary in 2013, viewed on the Internet Archive, Ainscough remembered hearing of the diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma, the same cancer Milla has in the show.",
      "\u201c'The results have told us that you have a rare type of cancer called epithelioid sarcoma.\u2019 I went numb. \u2018It\u2019s not treatable with chemotherapy or radiation, and there\u2019s a good chance we will have to amputate your arm but this disease is essentially terminal,\u2019\u201d\u00a0she wrote.",
      "She wrote that she \u201cdidn\u2019t buy into\u201d the doctor\u2019s \u201cpresumptions\u201d that she\u2019d be dead in five years and, five years later, was \u201cliving and thriving with cancer.\u201d",
      "Ainscough began\u00a0Gerson Therapy, which involves a diet \u201cbased on the theory that it addresses the cause of cancer by detoxifying the body and stimulating metabolism so that the body can heal itself,\u201d per\u00a0Sloan Kettering.",
      "Gerson Therapy is not scientifically proven, per Sloan Kettering. Ainscough, however, said it worked for her.",
      "In a\u00a0now-deleted article on Dolly.com, written four years after she was diagnosed, entitled, \u201cI\u2019m healing myself from cancer naturally,\u201d she wrote she was \u201cecstatic to report\u201d that Gerson worked.",
      "\u201cI have had no cancer spread, no more lumps pop up (they were popping up rapidly before) and I can actually see some of my tumors coming out through my skin and disappearing,\u201d she said.",
      "Ainscough went on to host \u201cWellness Warrior\u201d events, inviting other wellness figures in the space to join her on stage and speak about their experiences.",
      "What happened to Jess Ainscough?",
      "There are other similarities between Ainscough and\u00a0the\u00a0Milla Blake\u00a0character.\u00a0Like Milla, Ainscough was in a relationship. She and Tallon Pamenter were engaged and planning to be married in 2015, per her\u00a0Instagram.",
      "Also like Milla, Ainscough\u2019s mother was also diagnosed with cancer. Sharyn Ainscough died in 2013 of breast cancer.",
      "Ainscough herself died in 2015. According to a statement from her family released after her death by the\u00a0Sunshine Coast Daily, Ainscough did try \u201cconventional treatment\u201d before her death, but it was unsuccessful.",
      "\u201cIt has been speculated by people who have never met or treated Jess that, had she chosen to amputate her arm or undergo further conventional treatment, her chances of survival would have increased. Her treating oncologists do not agree with this uninformed view,\u201d the statement read.",
      "Did Belle Gibson and Jess Ainscough know each other?",
      "The book \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d which inspired \u201cApple Cider Vinegar,\u201d gets into Ainscough and Gibson\u2019s relationship.",
      "According to the book, they met two years before Ainscough died at a conference outside of Melbourne. Gibson approached Ainscough about her Whole Pantry app.",
      "The book said they were \u201cnot friends,\u201d and that Ainscough later said \u201csomething was off\u201d about Gibson.",
      "Gibson attended Ainscough\u2019s funeral services and, according to the book, \u201chysterically sobbed.\u201d",
      "According to the book, Ainscough\u2019s manager clarified on Instagram that there was \u201cno relationship\u201d between the two women.",

      "Gibson\u2019s popularity seemed unstoppable until 2015, when she was contacted by Donelly and Toscano, journalists from the Australian newspaper The Age who had some questions about her cancer claims.",
      "They had received a tip that Gibson was lying about her disease. Donelly and Toscano were unable to access Gibson\u2019s medical records to verify this claim, but they continued to investigate.",
      "\u201cWe asked ourselves, If she\u2019s lying about this, what else would she lie about?\u201d they wrote in their book.",
      "So they looked into Gibson\u2019s finances, and began to question whether Gibson had lied about her philanthropy. They wondered if the influencer was really donating large portions of her profits to various charities, as she publicly said.",
      "It turned out she was not, and the uncovering of these financial lies marked the beginning of the end for the influencer. After Donelly and Toscano published their reporting on Gibson\u2019s lack of charitable donations, supporters began turning against her and questioning other statements she had made about her health.",
      "The professional fallout for Gibson was swift. Penguin Australia canceled her new \u201cThe Whole Pantry\u201d cookbook and acknowledged it had not fact-checked Gibson\u2019s claims about her illness and fundraising activities.",
      "By March 2015, The Whole Pantry app had also been dropped from all Apple platforms, Donelly and Toscano reported for The Sydney Morning Herald in 2017.",
      "After Gibson was exposed, many of her former supporters shared their anger about her deception on social media. Some accused Gibson of causing real harm to people with cancer by encouraging them to pursue alternative treatment in lieu of traditional medical interventions.",
      "\u201cYour story creates a false hope which causes patients to abandon therapies with demonstrated efficacy in favour of ridiculous and dangerous placebo treatments,\u201d Lester Pepingco, a doctor based in Sydney, Australia, wrote in an open letter to Gibson, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "Does she have a partner and a son, like in the show?",
      "In the show, Belle is in a long-term relationship with Clive Rothwell and she has a young son from a previous relationship.",
      "Clive Rothwell is a real person and he and Gibson were previously together, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d It is unclear whether they are still a couple, as Gibson has not spoken publicly about her personal life in recent years.",
      "In a 2019 court hearing, Gibson described Rothwell as her housemate and friend, per The Guardian.",
      "The real Gibson does have a son, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "What has Belle Gibson said about her actions?",
      "Gibson admitted to lying about having cancer in an interview with Australia\u2019s The Weekly in 2015.",
      "\u201cNone of it\u2019s true,\u201d she told the publication.",
      "She also said it was \u201cvery scary\u201d to confront the reality that she is not terminally ill.",
      "\u201cBecause you start to doubt the crux of things that make up who you are. You know, I\u2019m blonde and I\u2019m tall, and I\u2019ve got hazel eyes and I\u2019ve got cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all of a sudden, you take away some of those high-level things and it\u2019s really daunting.\u201d",
      "She added that she didn\u2019t want forgiveness, and said she felt speaking out \u201cwas the responsible thing to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cAbove anything, I would like people to say, \u2018OK, she\u2019s human. She\u2019s obviously had a big life. She\u2019s respectfully come to the table and said what she\u2019s needed to say, and now it\u2019s time for her to grow and heal,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "In an interview a few months later with 60 Minutes Australia, Gibson claimed she had once genuinely believed she had brain cancer.",
      "She told interviewer Tara Brown that in 2015, she met a man called Mark Johns who told her he was an immunologist and neurologist.  60 Minutes Australia said they could not find evidence of a man named Mark Johns existing.",
      "\u201cHe had come to my home and went through a series of tests and this was dubbed \u2018integrative medicine,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "She said John tested her with \u201ca machine with lights on the front and that machine was apparently German technology\u201d and diagnosed her with cancer.",
      "\u201cHe said to me that I had a Stage 4 brain tumor and that I had approximately four months to live,\u201d she told Brown.",
      "Brown asked Gibson why she had claimed in her 2014 book that she had been diagnosed with cancer in a doctor\u2019s office, which is a different story.",
      "\u201cI think that being open in telling people the way that it happened would not be understood, and that people would be disappointed or angry for me not following what is the right way to go about this,\u201d Gibson replied.",
      "Gibson also said she \u201cbelieved (Johns) was a real doctor\u201d and believed she had been treated for cancer.",
      "\u201cAt the time, I believed I was having radiotherapy,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he gave me medication, I was told that it was oral chemotherapy, and I believed it.\u201d",
      "She said that when she learned she had never had cancer, she was devastated.",
      "\u201c(Once) I received the definitive, \u2018No, you do not have cancer,\u2019 then that was something I had to come to terms with,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThat takes a lot, and it was really traumatizing and I was feeling a huge amount of grief.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrief for not having cancer?\u201d Brown asked her.",
      "\u201cNo, that I had been lied to, that I felt like I had been taken for a ride,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cIt took me a lot to unpack that. And once I was strong enough, I was ready to come out to speak with my community about it.\u201d",
      "What legal consequences has she faced?",
      "In April 2017, the Federal Court of Australia issued a court order to Gibson and her company.",
      "The order declared that Gibson had engaged in \u201cmisleading or deceptive\u201d business conduct in violation of Australian Consumer Law when she stated she had been diagnosed with brain cancer in 2009, claimed she had four months to live, and claimed she \u201chad taken and then rejected conventional cancer treatments in favor of embarking on a quest to heal herself naturally.\u201d",
      "The court document also stated that Gibson\u2019s company had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by claiming that a \u201clarge part\u201d of earnings from the Whole Pantry app would be given to charities or good causes.",
      "In reality, less than $10,000 was donated from earnings of about $420,000, the court said.",
      "The court accused Gibson of not honoring her pledge to donate proceeds related to the Whole Pantry app to multiple non-profit organizations, including the Birthing Kit Foundation, One Girl and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.",
      "Only one of these charities, One Girl, received $1,000 from Gibson and her company, and the others \u201creceived no donation,\u201d the court said.",
      "The court order also states Gibson did not donate as promised to the family of Joshua Schwarz, a young boy with terminal brain cancer. His family had hoped \u201cto fly him to Mexico as a last resort for treatment,\u201d according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "Gibson met the Schwarz family through social media and promised to help them financially. However, the Schwarz family did not receive any of the promised funds from Gibson, according to the court order.",
      "In September 2017, the Federal Court of Australia ordered Gibson to pay $410,000 in relation to her \u201cunconscionable conduct.\u201d",
      "As of early 2020, Gibson had still not paid the fine, which had grown to more than half a million Australian dollars due to interest and other expenses, according to the Australian Associated Press, via The Guardian.",
      "Authorities raided Gibson\u2019s home in Melbourne in January 2020 in an attempt to seize items to sell to partially recoup her unpaid fine, the AAP reported at the time.",
      "Gibson\u2019s home was raided once again in 2021 after the fine remained unpaid.",
      "In late 2023, Donelly and Toscano received another update from Consumer Affairs Victoria, which they shared in their book.",
      "A spokesperson told them the agency was \u201ccontinuing to pursue\u201d Gibson and said the \u201centire amount\u201d of her debt is \u201cstill outstanding.\u201d",
      "Where is Belle Gibson now?",
      "A few years after her scandal, Gibson resurfaced in an unexpected way. In an interview shared on social media in 2020, she said she had been \u201cadopted\u201d by the Oromo community, an Ethiopian ethnic group in Melbourne.",
      "Wearing a traditional headscarf and using the name Sabontu, Gibson referenced \u201cour diaspora\u201d and discussed the current political situation \u201cback home\u201d in Ethiopia.",
      "When the interviewer asked Gibson what had inspired her to join the Oromo community, she called it a \u201cblessing that was given to me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel completely adopted by your nation and your people, and I feel like my heart is as invested as yours and your family\u2019s,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cYour struggle is my struggle,\u201d she added.",
      "By 2021, Gibson had been disowned by the Oromo community after they learned of her history, according to an investigation by Daily Mail Australia.",
      "\u201cShe was told not to come,\u201d Tarekegn Chimdi, president of the Australian Oromo Community Association in Victoria, told the publication.",
      "\u201cIt was concerning when someone is using the community\u2019s name who is not a member of that community,\u201d Chimdi said. \u201cShe was coming across as more Oromo than Oromo people.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Chimdi for comment."

      "This year's Super Bowl is another rematch between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.",
      "The last time the two teams faced off at the Super Bowl was in 2023. At the time, majority of astrologers and tarot readers correctly predicted the Chiefs would win in an article for TODAY.com.",
      "Have the waves turned in 2025 or are the Chiefs still the favored team? We consulted four astrologers and four tarot readers to get their predictions about who would win the Super Bowl in 2025. The predictions are mixed \u2013 but one team is a clear winner.",
      "Is it possible to predict the outcome of events using astrology? Here\u2019s our methodology",

      "Tarot readers pulled cards for prominent players, like Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts.",
      "What do the tarot readers predict about Chiefs v. Eagles?",
      "We spoke to four tarot readers who pulled cards related to the game.",
      "The results were somewhat mixed, with two tarot readers convinced of the Eagles' victory, one believing the Chiefs will win and another saying the Chiefs will face will face \"strong competition\" and obstacles in their quest to win their third consecutive Super Bowl.",
      "Blue June predicts the Eagles will win in a well-matched challenge. says. \"I pulled the Nine of Wands for the Eagles victory which means from start to finish the Chiefs put up a great fight and the game is especially intense during the first quarter as I\u2019ve pulled the Emperor card. The Nine of Pentacles warns the Eagles to move with caution and discipline, but they will surely persevere,\u201d she says.",
      "Theresa Reed, aka the Tarot Lady, forecasts the Chiefs will win. For the overall game, she pulled the Page of Swords, which she says means \"the game will be down to the wire,\" and \"a last-minute surprise move changes the game in an exciting way.\" She predicts one person will have an \"incredibly strong night.\"",
      "Sarah Potter predicted the Eagles would win after pulling the Seven of Wands, which she said symbolizes standing your ground and facing challenges. \"This could indicate that the Chiefs might need to defend their title and face strong competition,\" she says. Next, she pulled the Eight of Wands reversed. \"This card suggests delays or obstacles which implies that there are issues or setbacks that the team may need to overcome before achieving a win,\u201d she says.",
      "Fernando Salinas said things aren't looking good for the Chiefs. \"I pulled the Nine of Swords \u2014 definitely not a good omen. This is the card of anxiety, of worry, and of doubt,\" he says. Meanwhile, he pulled The Chariot for the Philadelphia Eagles. \"The Chariot is the card of victory, success, and ambition, and so a much better sign that the winning plays might be made by the Eagles this year,\" he says.",
      "What do the astrologers predict about Chiefs v. Eagles?",
      "Four astrologers made their predictions about the 2025 Super Bowl, studying how cosmic events will intersect with players' charts, plus the teams' overall charts.",
      "Catherine Urban calls this a \"very difficult call\" but concludes that the underdog Eagles will \"surprise fans with a better performance.\" She points to the moon in Cancer conjunct, or next to, Mars, currently retrograde in Cancer. Two of the quarterbacks \u2014 Hurts and Carson Wentz, alternate QB of the Chiefs \u2014\u00a0have Mars in Cancer, meaning this transit will affect them and be a significant moment.",
      "Lauren Ash predicts a \"nail-biter\" going back and forth until the end, ultimately resulting in a Chiefs victory. \"Energy drainer for all players \u2014 a total slog. Emotions will dominate the game. You will not have an idea of who is going to win this game until the end,\u201d Ash says.",
      "Renee Watt says the Eagles will benefit most from current planetary placements: \u201cWith the Cancer moon crossing over the team\u2019s natal Pluto, a surge of empowerment and emotional investment can give them the edge they need to score a win. With the sun and Mercury close to their North Node, an ability to think ahead will make it easier to anticipate the moves of their opponents. However, that doesn\u2019t mean the Chiefs won\u2019t put up a fight!\u201d",
      "Meghan Rose said Jupiter makes the case for either team winning.  Ultimately she thinks the Eagles will be the major upset winners.",
      "Finally, in my opinion, the Eagles will have extra luck due to the natal Jupiter in the birth chart for the team being aligned with the South Node of Destiny.",
      "In total, that amounts to six predictions for an Eagles victory and two for the Chiefs.",
      "We'll have to watch the game on Feb. 9 to find out."

    "summary": "What is the story and controversy behind Bianca Censori's Grammys dress? Did she break the law? Why are people worried?",
    "story": [
      "Bianca Censori caused a stir at the Grammys this year when she appeared on the red carpet wearing a barely-there dress.",
      "The Australian architectural designer and model, 30, arrived at the ceremony with her partner, the rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.",
      "Ye was nominated alongside\u00a0Ty Dolla $Ign, Rich The Kid, and Playboi Carti in the Best Rap Song category for \u201cCarnival.\u201d The last time Ye attended the Grammys was in 2015.",
      "\u201cNude\" dresses are nothing new on the red carpet, but Censori\u2019s provocative look seemed to go a step further than other past revealing outfits at major awards events.",
      "Her barely perceptible garment went viral and also raised questions on social media about indecent exposure laws.",
      "Read on to learn more about what Censori wore to the Grammys and whether she could face possible legal ramifications tied to their red carpet appearance.",
      "What did Bianca Censori wear to the Grammys, and why did it spark concern?",
      "Censori arrived at the Grammys on Feb. 2 wearing a long black coat. She coordinated with her partner, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, who also wore an all-black ensemble.",
      "As they posed for photographers, Censori slipped off the jacket and revealed a skintight, fully see-through dress.",
      "Ye shared a photo of the dress on Instagram on Feb. 4 with the caption, \u201cTHE INVISIBLE DRESS.\u201d",
      "The dress provoked major discussion and backlash on social media, raising questions about the nature of Ye and Censori's relationship and if the outfit \u2014\u00a0which was designed by his brand, Yeezy \u2014 was her choice.",
      "Psychologist Channa Bromley told TODAY.com in an email clothing is a \"a form of self-expression, autonomy, and identity.\"",
      "Bromley suggests Censori's Grammys is a \"case study\" into a partner potentially exerting undue influence over another's choice of clothes. If the choice of outfit were Censori's, Bromley says it would be \"marked by confidence, ease and ownership of the moment.\" If it wasn't, Bromley says you might see \"micro-expressions of discomfort, hesitation, forced compliance.\"",
      "\u201cIn controlling relationships, dress codes can serve as both a test of submission and a display of ownership. The more extreme the shift, the more likely it\u2019s a symptom of something deeper than just evolving style,\u201d Bromley says.",
      "Bromley says the video of her disrobing may strike viewers as \"unsettling\" because of the \"psychology behind it.\"",
      "\"The lack of natural confidence, the robotic compliance, the vacant expression, it doesn\u2019t read as a woman fully in charge of her choices,\" she says.",
      "Psychologist Kelsey Latimer says that changing clothing style in a relationship isn't necessarily a red flag. \"Are you making choices because you want to? Has your style simply changed and you like trying something new?\" she asks. But \"making changes in one\u2019s attire out of fear of what will happen if you don\u2019t\" or \"worry that your partner will get jealous that others might admire you\" are signs of an unhealthy relationship.",
      "Latimer says she's not surprised the outfit provoked such a response and questions into Censori's well-being. \"For most of us, wearing something that is extremely exposing would create a sense of vulnerability so if the person themselves is not making that choice then that can lead to a sense of physical or emotional vulnerability and lack of internal safety,\" she says.",
      "The message a nude dress sends",
      "Revealing looks are nothing new on the red carpet; other stars, including Chrissy Teigen, Shakira and Victoria Mon\u00e9t, sported dresses with sheer or cutout elements at the Grammys this year.",
      "Stars in general have been pushing the envelope for decades with daring looks and in one sense, Censori\u2019s latest look is just the continuation of that trend, fashion historian and professor Deirdre Clemente told TODAY.com in an email.",
      "\u201cCensori\u2019s nude dress is the culmination of more than a century of 'barely there' eveningwear,\u201d she said. \u201cToday, her dress is as shocking in its extremeness, as the dresses of the 1920s were 100 years ago.\u201d",
      "However, even today\u2019s \u201cnude\u201d looks generally contain some degree of coverage, however scant, whereas Censori\u2019s dress gave her the appearance of being fully naked.",
      "In this sense, Censori\u2019s dress differs from the risqu\u00e9 looks of other famously provocative style icons.",
      "\u201cWhy Censori\u2019s dress is different from previous incarnations of Marilyn Monroe or Kim Kardasian, is that it breaks a fundamental rule of fashion. And it does that on purpose,\u201d Clemente said.",
      "\u201cFor millennia, fashion has been used to simultaneously \u2018hide\u2019 and \u2018flaunt\u2019 the female form. It is in that tension that fashion exists,\u201d she continued. \u201cCensori\u2019s dress takes away the tension between \u2018wondering\u201d and \u2018knowing\u2019 that has defined evening wear for centuries.\u201d",
      "Will Censori face any legal consequences for her look?",
      "Following the Grammys, some wondered online whether Censori had broken any laws with her daring outfit.",
      "\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Bianca Censori being arrested for indecent exposure?\u201d one person wrote on X.",
      "\u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t consent to seeing you naked\u2026.That is called INDECENT EXPOSURE and it is a CRIME,\u201d another person commented. \u201cI never consented to seeing this woman naked and I\u2019m sure a lot of people with their children watching didn\u2019t either. This is really disturbing.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to TODAY.com that \u201can investigation has not been opened\u201d into Censori\u2019s Grammys look.",
      "In this situation, a criminal charge is very unlikely, Dmitry Gorin, a criminal defense attorney with the Los Angeles law firm Eisner Gorin LLP, told TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cSomebody would have to report the offense to the police, and I just see Los Angeles police having plenty of other work than investigating indecent exposure,\u201d he said.",
      "Besides, even if someone did decide to bring charges, Gorin says Censori\u2019s nude look does not meet the elements of Penal Code 314, the California statute that prohibits indecent exposure.",
      "The code states that to be considered \u201cindecent exposure,\u201d an act \u201cmust be done in a manner that the defendant had intent to draw public attention to their genitals for sexual gratification or to offend another person.\u201d",
      "Gorin argues that in Censori\u2019s case, context matters. He argues she was appearing at the Grammys in the capacity of a model, meaning that it would be expected that she would display her body in some way.",
      "\u201cI think in this situation, she\u2019s a model, she knew she\u2019d be getting a lot of attention,\u201d Gorin said. \u201cIf she was ever charged, her lawyer would say, \u2018Look, this is just a model showing off her body.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also noted that because she was appearing as a model and public figure, there was likely a secondary \u201ccommercial\u201d motivation for her red carpet appearance, and that it was unlikely she was driven solely by an intent to \u201csexually gratify\u201d or \u201coffend.\u201d",
      "Gorin also points out that the Grammys are known as a place where people try out daring looks on the red carpet.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a place to show off, to wear dresses and clothes that strike media and public attention,\u201d he said."

    "summary": "Researchers Australia said that they have for the first time successfully produced the first kangaroo embryos through IVF. It may help save endangered species.",
    "story": [
      "It's a major scientific leap \u2014 or at least a hop.",
      "Researchers in Australia said Thursday that they have for the first time successfully produced the first kangaroo embryos through in-vitro fertilization, in a breakthrough that may help save endangered species from extinction.",
      "Australia is not short of kangaroos \u2014 the bouncing creatures are commonly eaten there \u2014 but they are from the marsupial group of mammals that is mostly found in the country and has lost many species to extinction.",
      "The researchers' use of IVF on kangaroo eggs and sperm may help support the conservation of those marsupials, said Andres Gambini,  lead researcher and University of Queensland lecturer.",
      "\u201cOur team built on years of experience working with reproductive technologies in domestic animals like livestock and horses,\u201d Gambini told NBC News via email. \u201cBy adapting these techniques to the unique biology of kangaroos, we were able to create an embryo in the lab for the first time.\u201d",
      "The research will help scientists learn more about how marsupial embryos grow because the class reproduces differently compared to other mammals.",
      "\u201cKangaroos have a very short pregnancy, and the embryo can go into suspended animation for several months,\u201d Gambini said. \u201cOur success with IVF helps us better understand these early stages of development.\u201d",
      "Australia is one of the world's most biodiverse countries but also has the highest rate of mammal extinction. Australia\u2019s invasive species council says that since the European settlement, at least 33 mammal species have become extinct, with many of those marsupials.",
      "A historically high rate of extinction led the Australian government in 2022 to announce a 10-year\u00a0\u201czero extinctions\u201d plan to protect those under threat, reserving at least 30% of the country\u2019s land mass for conservation.",
      "\u201cIf we keep doing what we\u2019re doing, more plants and animals will become extinct,\u201d Australian Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said in the report. \u201cEven koalas are now endangered on the east coast of Australia.\u201d",
      "Now, more than 2,200 species in the country are classified as threatened with extinction, according to a 2023\u00a0report\u00a0by the nonprofit Australian Conservation Foundation.",
      "\u201cThe laws that are meant to be protecting Australia\u2019s nature are failing,\u201d the report said, adding that the country\u2019s major conservation policy as it existed then was \u201cbarely monitored, rarely enforced and full of loopholes that allow businesses to destroy nature.\u201d",
      "While kangaroos are not endangered, the University of Queensland researchers hope the latest breakthrough can help to preserve other endangered marsupial species native to the continent, including koalas, Tasmanian devils and northern hairy-nosed wombats.",
      "\u201cThis work gives us a new tool to help preserve genetic material in endangered species,\u201d Gambini said. \u201cBy creating and freezing embryos, we can safeguard the unique genetic of these animals.\u201d",
      "It's not the first time IVF has been used as a tool to preserve endangered species.",
      "Last year, scientists in Italy achieved the world\u2019s first IVF rhino pregnancy, offering hope for saving Kenya's northern white rhino \u2014 of which there are only two animals left on the planet \u2014 from extinction. They did so by transferring a lab-created rhino embryo into a surrogate mother.",
      "Still, the latest IVF breakthrough is just one step on a long road to a more comprehensive solution, Gambini said.",
      "\u201cThere are many unknowns, as we are just on the beginning and there is lot to discover yet,\u201d he said, adding that when combined with other strategies, \u201cit can make a real difference for species at risk.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Israel's defense minister said Thursday that he had instructed his military to prepare a plan to allow Palestinians to voluntarily leave the Gaza Strip, after his country's leadership embraced President Donald Trump's widely condemned remarks in which he said the United States may seek ownership of the territory.",
      "Welcoming what he called Trump's \"bold initiative,\" Israel Katz said in a statement Thursday that Palestinians in Gaza \"should be granted the freedom to leave and emigrate, as is customary everywhere in the world.\" He said the plan would include \"exit options\" for Palestinians to leave Gaza via land crossings, with the possibility of \"special arrangements\" for departures by sea and air.",
      "Katz's comments came after Trump on Tuesday suggested to the press and visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. should take a \"long-term ownership position\" of Gaza and \"develop\" the enclave, which he had earlier in the day referred to as a \"demolition site.\"",

      "The president is \"committed to rebuilding Gaza and to temporarily relocating\" Palestinians during those reconstruction efforts, she said, adding that Trump has not committed to sending U.S. troops to Gaza as part of the effort.",
      "Trump's remarks were widely rejected for their apparent dismissal of Palestinians' long pursuit of internationally recognized statehood. The Human rights organization Human Rights Watch said in a statement that the plan amounted to an \"intent to escalate ethnic cleansing in Gaza.\"",
      "Speaking to Fox News on Wednesday, Netanyahu praised Trump's remarks, adding that \u201cthe actual idea of allowing first Gazans who want to leave, to leave, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d",
      "Katz's plan would represent a major policy shift for Israel, which \u2014\u00a0along with Egypt \u2014\u00a0has maintained a land, air and sea blockade on the enclave since 2007, when Hamas took power two years after Israel withdrew from the territory following 38 years of occupation."

      "Many wonder whether it\u2019s even practically possible, instead suggesting it might be more a diplomatic gambit or a distraction technique rather than an actual policy plan.",
      "Regardless of its intention or viability, the alleged plan to transform the war-ravaged Palestinian enclave on Israel\u2019s western flank into the \u201cRiviera of the Middle East\u201d has been condemned outside of far-right circles in Israel and the United States.",
      "\u201cThis is the most foolish idea any American president has put forth in the modern history of the United States,\u201d said Fawaz Gerges, a veteran Middle East expert and professor at the London School of Economics. \u201cIt is beyond any kind of rational thinking, any kind of policy feasibility.\u201d",

      "Other diplomats reached later by NBC News from Europe and Asian capitals said there was widespread shock over the suggestion of removing the 2.2 million Palestinians in order to rebuild Gaza.",

      "The immediate and sometimes angry reaction to the proposal is an indication of how in Gaza, Trump has alighted on a strip of land as emotionally charged and politically intractable as it is tiny and ruined. Most governments in the world recognize it as part of a future Palestinian state. And though the United States does not, it has been involved in six decades of peacemaking efforts in support of a two-state solution to the conflict."

      "Four years after a military coup that has morphed into a grinding civil war, experts say there is a growing mental health crisis in the Southeast Asian nation, made worse by the junta\u2019s atrocities against civilians and a humanitarian disaster that has left more than 3 million people displaced.",
      "They find some relief at the Mae Tao Clinic on the outskirts of Mae Sot, a border town in neighboring Thailand.",
      "Each morning, hundreds of Burmese arrive at the clinic, waiting to see a doctor, receive vaccinations or get a prenatal checkup. Some are living in refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, while others have jobs as migrant workers or have crossed into Thailand illegally.",
      "The donor-funded clinic, which opened in the 1980s with only four beds, has since evolved into a full-fledged primary health facility that offers a range of free services, including psychiatric care. It says its 700 doctors, nurses, medics and volunteers treat 120,000 people a year, a number that may increase after a freeze on foreign aid by the Trump administration that threatens to close U.S.-supported health care facilities treating Myanmar refugees in Thai border camps.",
      "Those who have fled Myanmar \u201chave so many traumas,\u201d said Thein, a Myanmar refugee who is one of the psychiatric care unit\u2019s two Burmese-speaking psychiatrists.",

It is a single-story cement building painted light blue, with the windows and doors covered in translucent black film to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",

      "Like most of his patients, Thein\u2019s life took a turn on Feb. 1, 2021, when the Myanmar military \u2014 which has ruled the former British colony for much of its history since it gained independence in 1948 \u2014 overthrew democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Peaceful protests broke out immediately, to which the new military government responded with deadly violence.",

On Friday, Myanmar state media reported that the state of emergency that has been in place since the coup had been extended for another six months, further delaying promised elections.",
      "Though the junta remains in charge, its hold on power has slipped in the face of a coordinated offensive by ethnic rebel groups that have fought the Myanmar military for decades. In the past year the government has lost control of vast swaths of territory around the country, creating instability along Myanmar\u2019s borders with Thailand, India, China and others.",
      "\u201cI want to help my friends, but I don\u2019t want to kill people,\u201d Thein said. \u201cSo I treated the wounded people or wounded soldiers.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "MANILA, Philippines \u2014 Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte was impeached Wednesday on a range of accusations that include plotting to assassinate the president, large-scale corruption and failing to strongly denounce China\u2019s aggressive actions against Filipino forces in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "The move by legislators in the House of Representatives, many of them allies of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., deepens a bitter political rift between the two highest leaders of one of Asia\u2019s most rambunctious democracies.",
      "Marcos has strengthened defense ties with his country\u2019s treaty ally, the United States, while the vice president\u2019s father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, nurtured cozy relations with China and Russia during his stormy term that ended in 2022.",
      "Sara Duterte did not immediately comment on her impeachment, but her brother, Rep. Paolo Duterte, said it was \u201ca clear act of political persecution.\u201d Rival lawmakers maneuvered to quickly collect signatures and push a \u201cbaseless impeachment case\u201d to the Senate, he said.",
      "Duterte has repeatedly accused Marcos, his wife and his cousin, House Speaker Martin Romualdez, of corruption, weak leadership and attempting to muzzle her because of speculation she may seek the presidency in 2028 after Marcos\u2019s six-year term ends.",
      "At least 215 legislators in the lower house signed the complaint, significantly more than the required number to rapidly send the petition to the Senate, which would serve as a tribunal to try the vice president, House of Representatives Secretary-General Reginald Velasco told a plenary House meeting in the body\u2019s last session before a four-month recess.",
      "Among the signatories of the impeachment complaint was the president\u2019s son, Rep. Sandro Marcos, and Romualdez. The petition urged the Senate to shift itself into an impeachment court to try the vice president, \u201crender a judgement of conviction,\u201d remove her from office and ban her from holding public office.",
      "\u201cDuterte\u2019s conduct throughout her tenure clearly displays gross faithlessness against public trust and a tyrannical abuse of power that, taken together, showcases her gross unfitness to hold public office and her infidelity to the laws and the 1987 Constitution,\u201d the complaint said.",
      "Duterte ran alongside Marcos in 2022 on a campaign battle cry of unity in a deeply divided Southeast Asian country. Both were scions of strongmen accused of human rights violations, but their strong regional bases of support combined to give them landslide victories.",
      "Marcos is the son and namesake of the late dictator ousted in a 1986 pro-democracy uprising. The vice president\u2019s father and Marcos\u2019s predecessor, Duterte, led a deadly anti-drug crackdown that is being investigated by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity.",
      "The whirlwind political alliance of the campaign rapidly frayed when they took office.",
      "The impeachment complaint against the vice president focused on a death threat she made against the president, his wife and the House speaker last year, irregularities in the use of her office\u2019s intelligence funds and her failure to stand up to Chinese aggression in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "She said in an online news conference on Nov. 23 that she had contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned wasn\u2019t a joke.",
      "She later said that she wasn\u2019t threatening him, but was expressing concern for her own safety. However, her statements set off an investigation and national security concerns.",
      "Allegations of graft and corruption against her also emanated from a monthslong and televised House investigation on the alleged misuse of 612.5 million pesos ($10.5 million) of confidential and intelligence funds received by Duterte\u2019s offices as vice president and education secretary. She has since left the education post after her political differences with Marcos deepened.",
      "She has also been accused of unexplained wealth and failure to declare her wealth as required by the law. She has refused to respond to questions in detail in tense televised hearings last year.",
      "The impeachment complaint accused Duterte of undermining the Marcos government\u2019s policies, including her description of the administration\u2019s handling of territorial disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea as a \u201cfiasco.\u201d The complaint also mentioned her silence over China\u2019s increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters.",
      "\u201cHer sheer evasiveness and silence on the West Philippine Sea issue, an issue that strikes at the core of Philippine sovereignty, is diametrically opposed to her being so loquacious as to other issues,\u201d the impeachment petition said, using the Philippine name for the disputed waters."

      "LISBON, Portugal \u2014 Rahim Al-Hussaini was named Wednesday as the new Aga Khan, spiritual leader of the world\u2019s millions of Ismaili Muslims, following the death of his father.",
      "The 53-year-old was designated as the Aga Khan V, the 50th hereditary imam of the Ismaili Muslims, in his father\u2019s will. His father died Tuesday in Portugal.",
      "The Aga Khan is considered by his followers to be a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad and is treated as a head of state.",
      "The Aga Khan Development Network and the Ismaili religious community announced earlier that His Highness Prince Karim Al-Hussaini, the Aga Khan IV and 49th hereditary imam of the Shiite Ismaili Muslims, died surrounded by his family.",
      "Prince Rahim is the eldest son of the former Aga Khan. He was educated in the U.S., having studied comparative literature at Brown University, and has served on the boards of various agencies within the Aga Khan Development Network, the spiritual leader\u2019s main philanthropic organization, according to a statement it released Wednesday.",
      "The organization deals mainly with issues of health care, housing, education and rural economic development. It says it works in over 30 countries and has an annual budget of about $1 billion for nonprofit development activities.",
      "The Aga Khan Development Network said Prince Rahim took a special interest in its work to fight climate change and protect the environment.",
      "The late Aga Khan was given the title of \u201cHis Highness\u201d by Queen Elizabeth in July 1957, two weeks after his grandfather, the Aga Khan III, unexpectedly made him heir to the family\u2019s 1,300-year dynasty as leader of the Ismaili Muslim sect.",
      "Over decades, the late Aga Khan evolved into a business magnate and a philanthropist, moving between the spiritual and the worldly with ease.",
      "A defender of Islamic culture and values, he was widely regarded as a builder of bridges between Muslim societies and the West despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 his reluctance to become involved in politics.",

      "Ismailis lived for many generations in Iran, Syria and South Asia before also settling in east Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East, as well as Europe, North America and Australia more recently. They consider it a duty to donate up to 12.5% of their income to the Aga Khan as steward.",
      "Shenila Khoja-Moolji, an associate professor at Georgetown University who studies Muslim societies, said Ismailis turn to the Aga Khan in matters of faith and daily life, and followers believe in his \u201cdivinely inspired knowledge\u201d that allows him to interpret the Quran.",
      "Prince Rahim has three siblings, two brothers and one sister."

    "summary": "As China celebrated the Lunar New Year, shoppers and travelers said they were feeling constrained by a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.",
    "story": [
      "BEIJING \u2014 For people in China facing an economic slowdown, every yuan counts these days.",
      "During the last Lunar New Year holiday, construction worker Huang Peng took a high-speed train to his hometown in Heilongjiang Province, traveling more than 500 miles in about six hours.",
      "This year he took a slow train instead, paying 160 yuan ($22) to sit upright for 18 hours. For Huang, that was a far more affordable option than the high-speed train ($92) or even a bed on the slow train ($40).",
      "Though Huang makes more money in Beijing than he would back home, living expenses in the Chinese capital are high.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so hard to save money,\u201d he said in an interview at the Beijing Railway Station.",
      "The Lunar New Year is China\u2019s biggest holiday of the year and a traditional gauge of spending, as hundreds of millions of people travel to see family in the largest annual human migration on the planet.",
      "Chinese travelers made a total of 501 million domestic trips during the eight-day holiday, an increase of 5.9% compared with last year, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism said Wednesday as the country returned to work. They spent 677 billion yuan ($93 million) on domestic tourism during the holiday, the ministry said, up 7% compared with last year.",
      "But as they enter the Year of the Snake, Chinese consumers appear to be feeling squeezed.",
      "Though China\u2019s consumption expenditure per capita grew more than 5% last year, to about 28,200 yuan ($3,900), consumer confidence is at all-time lows, affecting retail sales in sectors such as clothing and cosmetics. That could limit long-term gross domestic product growth as China adjusts to slower growth overall.",
      "Increasing consumption is considered vital for reducing China\u2019s reliance on exports, all the more so as U.S. tariffs and Chinese counter-tariffs stir fears of an all-out trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.",
      "Chinese shoppers are more focused on finding deals, with discount retailers such as Walmart\u2019s Sam Club becoming local favorites.",
      "\u201cThis year, I find myself buying for quality and value for money,\u201d said a woman surnamed Ren who was on the Wangfujing shopping street in Beijing ahead of the holiday. \u201cFor example, I buy clothes with discounts and snacks, too.\u201d",
      "In an effort to encourage spending, Beijing has been pushing an expanded consumer trade-in scheme that offers subsidies for home appliances such as microwaves and rice cookers, as well as electronic items such as smartphones.",
      "Though officials have not shared the total cost of the incentives, the Finance Ministry said last month that the government had so far allocated 81 billion yuan ($11 billion) for consumer goods trade-ins to support consumption in 2025, Reuters reported.",
      "Shopper Xu Zicong said he saved 1,500 yuan ($208) on his new iPhone 16, thanks to the subsidy combined with discounts from the retailer and Apple, whose China sales are slowing as it faces growing competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei and Xiaomi.",
      "\u201cIf there wasn\u2019t a government subsidy, I wouldn\u2019t consider buying an iPhone now,\u201d Xu said at an electronics store in Beijing. \u201cI might wait or get a cheaper phone from other brands.\u201d",
      "The subsidies apply for sales online, too, where shoppers find a deluge of deals on everything from movie tickets to restaurants to travel.",
      "In a speech last week before the Lunar New Year holiday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping acknowledged facing \u201ca complex and challenging situation\u201d but said Beijing had \u201cintroduced a package of new measures, thereby facilitating the recovery and improvement of the economy.\u201d",
      "Experts say Chinese officials may need to introduce more aggressive stimulus measures.",
      "\u201cThe subsidies have been highly successful since their rollout,\u201d said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing. \u201cHowever, the effectiveness could fade if the government sticks\u00a0to the same strategy of just subsidizing durable goods.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, Huang is hoping for a more comfortable trip home for the next Lunar New Year holiday.",
      "\u201cIf I make more money next year,\u201d he said, \u201cthen of course I will take the high-speed train and enjoy the luxury.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Postal Service has agreed to resume accepting shipments from China, less than 12 hours after announcing it would stop doing so.",
      "\"Effective February 5, 2025, the Postal Service will continue accepting all international inbound mail and packages from China and Hong Kong Posts,\" it said in an updated statement Wednesday morning. \"The USPS and Customs and Border Protection are working closely together to implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery.\"",
      "The Postal Service had earlier announced it would stop accepting packages from China, as well as Hong Kong, in the wake of the Trump administration's decision to impose a new round of 10% tariffs on all goods coming from the country.",
      "Letters and flats were not affected by the initial announcement. While the Postal Service did not offer an explanation for the shipment halt, Trump ended a so-called \"de minimis\" exemption for Chinese goods worth less than $800 in making the tariff announcement.",
      "A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson had earlier said China would take \u201cnecessary measures\u201d to protect its companies, The Associated Press reported \u2014 urging the U.S. to \u201cstop politicizing economic and trade issues and using them as a tool, and to stop unreasonably suppressing Chinese companies.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Feb. 5, 2025, 10:35 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated when the Postal Service announced it would resume accepting shipments from China. The move came 12 hours after it stopped doing so, not 24."
